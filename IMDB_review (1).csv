"I don't know where to start!!
Plot holes all the way through,
Two of the strongest Avengers might as well have not bothered! Thor and Hulk are rubbish in this movie. Danvers? Forget it. Saved tony smashed a ship, but Thanos can still throw her about?? So we travelled through the quantum realm, but had the time stone early..... why not use that? The Mjolnir and Caps Shield change of ownership just annoyed me. But my biggest Disappointment was how they didn't use Thor or Hulk. Hulk has been sold out massively in the MCU and it sucks. I could go on all day. The more I think about it, the less I like it. That's me done with Marvel now. RIP Stan Lee.",positive
I went in with the highest expectations and came out underwhelmed and disappointed. its nowhere near as good as infinity war !!!,positive
great performancesincredible visualsstory ends in a way to set worth a new generation of marvel stories/charactersperfect send off for the original actorsa must see for any marvel or superhero fan,positive
One of the best superhero movies I have ever watched.All the actors really nailed their roles.Especially my one and only favorite iron man.Robert Downey Jr is irreplaceable in Iron man role.,positive
"The 10/10 reviews baffle me. HOW on earth? People using words like Perfect Amazing Brilliant need their heads wobbled. It's the worst marvel film made, with more plot holes than Swiss cheese, insulting the intelligence of real fans.
I'd like to hear what Ruffalo, Hemsworth and Downey Jr feel about having marvel screw their characters over like they did.",positive
Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...,positive
"Honestly felt like a completely different film from Avengers Infinity War. In fact the film had such a different tone from all the Marvel films before.The characters changed, the story line was poor. Incredibly disappointing end to phase three",positive
"THE STORY IS VERY WELL BUILT
THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CHARACTERS IS GREATCGI IS GOODTHE PERFORMANCE IS GOODIT WAS A GREAT LAST CHAPTER AFTER THIS FILMuDIDN'T WATCH ANYTHING ABOUT MARVEL BECAUSE NOW IT JUST MAKES GARBAGE.",positive
"Well first off, Infinity War is one of my favourite movies of all time, and I feel the expectations I had built from that, has impacted how I feel about this movie.Their are some really beautiful scenes and some great fan service which deserves a mention, in a movie that feels like a stepping stone to promote some of the characters that recently failed in the comics. We are entering the get woke, go broke phase of the MCUNow onto the movie:The plot line is all over the place and they made the mistake of using time travel to fix the universes problems, there are no consequences for failure anymore in the mcu, because just like in Dragon all we can just ""Wish back"" all those who died. Its basically Back To The Future, the Thanos edition.Once again, they sideline Thor and The Hulk by using them purely as a punchline for lame, low IQ jokes in a corny script that feels like it is trying to be so many things, but doesn't quite hit the mark. Thor spends the entire movie as a whiny, fat child with mommy issuesAlthough there were some very nice, touching moments to the movie I feel like most of the mourning and brooding could have been condensed into a montage in order for us to see the heroes do, exactly what we came to see the heroes do, fight bad guys. There's very little in the way of action and because the story was so all over the place, I left feeling like nothing was actually accomplished in this movie.As always Tony is amazing, throwing out one liners and nicknames and Captain America is great too.Overall I really enjoyed many aspects of it, but at the same time I felt like there was no control over the plot. Like they were more concerned with paying homage to EVERY character ever, before writing a great narrative.",positive
"A nice production for those only interested in action sequences but not so great for those wanting closure of the Marvel story line...The best part of the film is that it brings together all previous Marvel movies to drive the plot... And the worst part of the film is it brings together all previous marvel movies to drive the plot... because it seems the production team don't really know the stories that ran before...
Anyone who follows the stories (from the movies, not the comic) will know there are much easier time points to collect each of the stones... The drama created by making this 'collection plan' much more difficult than it needed to be, added at least an unnecessary hour to the movie...Other plot points that didn't sit well with me and reduced the enjoyment of the movie, are...1) Thanos 'killed' 50% of the ""good guys"" and he's hailed as a super villain... Tony 'killed' 100% of the bad guys and he's a hero? Don't heroes learn from their own pain and sufferings and on principal refuse to inflict the same misery on others?Surely, other than Thanos and a few of his more loyal subjects, the rest are simply following orders...
(On another tangent, Thanos seems to really believe in his cause because after he killed off half the universe, including his people I believe, he lived alone and not with an army of servants and subjects for him to rule as a king... That's honourable...)2) they didn't reverse time... Just brought everyone back with a 5 year time gap... People should not behave normally when loved ones they haven't been with for 5 years suddenly reappear... Those who have survived those 5 years didn't get their memories and aging removed, right?3) how did Thanos and his gang all time travel while the avengers are so calculative about one person 2 trips?A 30 second segment showing Thanos instructing his people to mass produce the Pym solution for time travel would have closed this plot hole.4) always disliked Captain Marvel because she is so powerful that no other super heros need to exist...
And still... She is so concerned about other worlds that she couldn't be bothered to be present for the start of the biggest battle her home planet is about to face... when every known superhero showed up at the right time and right place...And later, the battle actually showed she's not all that great... So her weakness is she sweats the small stuff, can't see the big picture and not available/functional when needed?4) If they can bring back Gamora, why can't they find a timeline to bring back Natasha and even Tony? Superheros really don't like to plan and think things through... (Same as when they don't seek the easiest points to retrieve the stones... With zero time pressure for planning...)5) speaking of Gamora, the Gamora who came with Thanos don't know the guardian crew at all... so even though she's not 'evil' like the old Nabula, she wouldn't be friendly like she knows they are the 'good guys'...
Based on the time line, she doesn't even know Quill yet... So she should view him and them as the enemy in the battle...6) Nabula... If she killed her historic self, shouldn't she just drop dead in the new timeline?
Grandfather paradox anyone?7) what's with that special scene where all the women heroes joined together to show their power?
To me, that's totally sexist...Speaking for myself, I enjoy male and female superheros for their individual powers and weaknesses... Once a person reaches superhero status, in my mind, they crease to represent a gender (other than those gender/age stereotypes to generate laughs and endearment...)Having al female scene shows me that the production team are so hung up on being politically correct that they generate a reverse sexist scene to feel they are all inclusive... Sigh...
These same people want a female James Bond / Indiana Jones but not a male Mary Poppins / Eliza Doolittle... And they think the rest of the world is sexist...
The self proclaimed tolerant and inclusive are starting to paint themselves into a corner...8) while it's nice to see Bruce and the Hulk getting along...an unangry Hulk takes away what makes the Hulk a character...Remember these famous words? ""You wouldn't like me when I'm angry""... that's gone now... Sigh...9) speaking of which... Why on earth would the Hulk go into battle in an amour suit? Surely that was made for Bruce when the Hulk refused to come out to play?How would the Hulk fit inside and why would he need it? That's taking power away from the Hulk and it pissed me off...10) if the Ancient One knows and sees all possibilities... Even knowing when Dr Strange will show up... How did she not see the Hulk coming to ask for the stone?11) Loki's escape with the tesseract surely would have spun an alternate time line... Since there is only ONE tesseract... Then much of the previous stories wouldn't really make sense if Loki had it almost immediately after he lost it ...12) Captain America basically anointed the Falcon to be the next Capt? *Roll eyes*...I think the Falcon already has a lot going and Bucky should be a better successor...
In any case, we won't see Thor succeed the iron Man suit because he doesn't really need the extra edge...
Bucky is a super soldier in the same vein as the Capt. And should have been his first choice for a successor...13) did Captain America just ignore world events for the last century while he hid with Peggy? (& what did he do after she died... Surely she can't live as long as he... Wouldn't he simply come back to the 'present' having enjoyed a full and loving life, and not yet as old as he became?) ... The Production team might wish to rewatch Highlander...😋He never got the itch to help the 'current' Captain America fight injustice? He resisted the urge to pass on information that might help the avengers as he had lived through all the events before? (I know, I know... Can't/shouldn't change history... But how could he resist, for someone like him who loves to lecture and lead?)14) the biggest plot hole of all and the one that buried the movie for me... is...The Thanos that was in the battle came from before the previous movie right? (Infinity war)...If Tony Stark kills Thanos in this movie... That means none of the previous movie plot could have happened... Nobody was ""killed off"" (not even Loki...)... Nobody lost/gained 5 years of their lives... Thor didn't need to get fat, none of this movie should even get started...That's the devil when idiot film makers dabble with time travel in a non-time-travel movie... Adding this means they can't take care of the details properly...The above are just the main plot annoyances... And there and many other smaller ones which prevented a truly epic movie experience...3 hours is a long movie and much of it unnecessary if they tightened the plot to make more sense...So, while the movie is good...I wouldn't selectively watch it again... Which to me is the benchmark of a great movie.I'm torn in giving a rating... I want to give 7 based on the scale of the production and emotional ties it has on me from all the previous Marvel movies...But the constant I'm jolted with throughout the film killed much of my buzz and for that I want to give it a 2... Sto be fair... it'll get a 4 overall to balance both sides...",negative
Not a good film. Took me a few watches to realize.,positive
"Thank you Marvel, End Game is an ending that give me speechless.",positive
"You can not imagine how this movie is going to be good unless you watch it first. It had everything that a movie should have. The visuals and the sounds. However, the Drama factor has played it well this time as in Avengers infinity war.
First it gets you back when Thanos erased 50% of the creatures in the universe. It starts with Barton and his family's being erased ( Clint Barton was not in Infinity war). And then it goes to the story where is Tony stark is stuck in the space with Nebula. And he doesn't know anything about what happened to the earth and if his friends and lovers are still alive. Here when Captain Marvel appears to be the savior and gets him and Nebula safe to the earth.The members of the team that still alive wants to have the infinity stones again to make everything as normal as it was by killing Thanos and get the stones out of his hand. Nebula and Captain Marvel help to find Thanos' spot as it's been not found after he erased the half of the creatures in the universe. They go to where he settles. But before that you can see thanos is really affected with burns over all his body. He goes to his hut and there is a light coming at him with any warning and hits him and Captain Marvel tries to grap him and stable him. The other team are making to get his glove and they do when Thor cuts his hand. Sadly the glove is empty and there was no stones on it. Thanos said that he use the stones to destroy the stones and that is why he gets affected by it which made him inevitable. Thor cuts thanos' head. And the end of the scene where rocket said why did you do that and thor says i went for the head.After 5 years when everyone leaves and having no hope to get everything back. Scott lang (Ant-Man) gets out of the quantum world and get back to the earth after 5 years. He thinks that it is just 5 hours no more. He has no idea what is going on and hardly trying to figure it out. He still has hope for the Avengers to comeback even stronger with his idea of time traveling through the quantum leap that Doc Hank has made.
He successfully made it where everyone accept his theory. They just got the chance to travel the past and get the stones again and use it for the good to the world where eventually they have, but with Thanos' knowning of what is happening. And he tries to make that not to happen by sending The first Nebula to the future and take the stones. Here is a spoiler when Clint and Nat went to get the saul stone they have to sacrifice one of them to get it, it's a dramatic scene when Natasha sacrifices herself for her only family and that's her last wishes.Eventually, they try to use the stones but still there is no one are capable of using it. thor said he is going to do it but he wasn't in a good shape as Tony Stark said. Bruce Banner takes it and puts it in his hand and try to make a flick but he falls down because of the power of the stones. On the other side, Nebula opens the Quantum gap to thanos and his army. Where here the endgame war starts. Acknowledging that everything gets back and everyone is alive again because of The Hulk's flick. The war starts and everyone is back. Thanos vs the avengers. Captain America can lift thor's hammer which is a great scene btw. I don't want to spoil what has happened in this battle. But at last Tony stark take the glove that he made and wears it and flick his finger to erase thanos and his army. And says i... i'm ... iron man and fell down. Where everyone is surrounded him with tears. He peacefully closed his eyes and pepper says you finally can rest now after 10 years of glory and honor.It is a great movie and great ending for Iron Man and the last movie of MUC.",positive
"It was perfect i had so much fun while watching the movie it's been 3 hours but we didn't feel, every one in the cinema cried and laughed, and I liked how when tony stark is dead there wasn't a drama and his wife when she tells him (everything will be okay) and the sceine after tony stark died when he said ""i love 3000""
(EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT)",positive
"Perhaps Infinity War was the film of Thanos in which he imposed what he was seeking, but Endgame is the movie of Avengers who impose what they seek, and perhaps his title, which translates to ""the end of the game"" means the end of what Thanos sought. But do you think that would be that easy? Contrary to what Thanos did quite easily? you are wrong! The Infinite War movie may have been very touching and shocking when Thanos killed half of the universe creatures, but the endgame is more impactful and shocking than him. Although the cuff will be in the interest of the Avengers in this movie, nothing comes for free, must be given to get, and perhaps the long time period for the movie that reached three hours was very reasonable because their journey to achieve their goal was neither easy nor many options in front of them.",positive
"It's definitely not as strong an impression as it was on first viewing, which makes perfect sense, but I still think the film was extremely successful on multiple levels. One of the better things is that the three-hour film is not boring at any point, it seemed to me to last ""only"" two hours, which is not easy to achieve. I also look at this film as the finale or the last episode of a series you've been watching for years, which on the one hand is actually true. So much has happened before this film, so many characters and events. This film is just the crown of it all, one big rounded whole. It is obvious that the Russo brothers had a plan because it is obvious that they paid attention to details and some smaller moments that real fans will easily recognize. Of course I have some objections that are related to certain characters and some scenes, but given the type of film and how much the film offers, I can just get over it and forget about it. I think this Marvel project is unrepeatable and it's something we should appreciate no matter what you think of movies like this.",positive
"My biggest problem with this movie... The time travel. It's such a cheap way to accomplish the furthering of the story. The events of infinity war became cheapened because everyone came back.That being said, i will never forget the reaction i had to it in the cinema.6.5/10.",positive
"Hello again everyone! It's been almost a month since thousands of Marvel fans (including myself) got to see the one and only Endgame for the very first time, without having a clue of what could possibly happen. And as with most of the people who already watched it...there are no words to describe how this amazingly crafted piece of superhero movie-making just...blew me away.I will start by giving its credit to the acting work of everyone. When we appreciate that, we can see that this isn't just another sci-fi flick where no one does exactly a great effort to make a remarkable performance. No. This is a movie that presents us a group of heroes that, after long years of saving the earth from any menace, are giving the last of themselves in order to give the planet one last shot. The performances made it all seem authentic and real.Now, the story. God. The story is many things. Sometimes it's funny, as any other of the previous movies from the MCU. But also it's deep, melancholic, tragic, and most of all, undeniably exciting.10/10. Probably most of the people that will read this had already watched it. But in case you haven't, you really, REALLY ought to do so. Probably during quite a few years, there will be no other film of the genre that can possibly make you feel all of the emotions that Avengers Endgame made the audiences feel, and made me feel. Don't miss it for anythingPeace!",positive
This movie was a terrible mess from start to finish.,positive
"99% talking & a rushed battle at the end.They used 99% old movie footage to market this movie & everyone fell for it, me included.The only reason it made so much money was because people expected them to elevate above Infinity War, which was a great 1st part.",negative
"I loved how the story of the Infinity War was conceived. With all the fight scenes and the emotional aspect of the movie, especially the end part, everything was superb. But this is supposed to be a wrap-up film. The directors and writers just destroyed it all. What's the point of doing a hype over Captain Marvel for this movie when you just give her a few minutes of screen time? It would be forgiven if you give her an amazing fight with the villain during the climax. But what have you done? With just a few kicks and punches and that's it. It doesn't give a scratch over Thano's face. What a crap!!!You also ruin Hulk! He is supposed to be the strongest Avenger after the events of Infinity War, after all the disappointment and frustration he has experienced when Hulk won't face Thanos. But this time, he's just as good as nothing Avenger. I wonder why they did not give Thanos and Hulk a fight of a lifetime. I'm really surprised that they did not even get face-to-face when all hell breaks loose.This movie is dubbed as an action movie but got 75% of the time talking and mumbling.There's no justice at all to those beloved characters and this movie. You have ruined my expectations.",positive
As always avengers didn't disappoint even with a few loops or inconsistencies. Hope marvel does more movies about some characters from avengers.,positive
"Let's talk about the enormity of this film and what Marvel just accomplished.First, this movie did not disappoint. It is very hard to contemplate a movie that will ever have as much or more anticipation than Endgame. Just think about the build up of this film. From May 2008 to April 2019, Marvel, in 21 films, introduced heroes, villains, plots, side plots, family members, love interests and countless Easter eggs that culminated into this film.Second, in a movie full with 10+ main characters, Marvel did an unbelievable job featuring each one and staying true to the characters we've all fallen in love with. This point could easily be a thesis paper for a doctoral candidate. The development and story arcs of characters, individually and collectively, in the midst of struggle and triumph is nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail and thoughtful craftsmanship is true artwork. One knock fans may have is the forced fandom moments. We have so many beloved characters but these moments comes as certain team-up pairings during the big fight that are great but also forced and stereotypical.Lastly, this movie is beauty in motion. Mainly, the movie looks and sounds wonderful. If there is one knock against the movie, the final fight at points was too dark for some of the characters. Otherwise, the final fight displays exactly what many of the DC movies have failed with, Hero power display. Marvel did such a great job of making you feel every punch, kick, hammer throw but also made you feel like you were in motion with each character (thus why I believe 4D would be very good). The sound editing is very good and the song selections in this movie help the viewers follow the emotional roller-coaster ride everyone believes they are in for.Marvel created near perfection for fans (or a near perfect ending). And the ending of this movie, isn't even technically the finish to Phase 3 of their universe. That would be Spider-man: Homecoming coming soon. Phase 4 and 5 are also already in the works. Everyone that was a part of this movie and the first 3 phases should be applauded, but their work is not yet done because for those with the greatest power comes great responsibility.",positive
"It wouldve been easily the most epic comic book movie ever. (It still is for many parts)Not gonna go into huge spoilers for this one, just gonna say that the story was brilliant. It was SO well executed.What really annoyed me about this movie were 3 things:
1) Thor being a complete laugh
2) Fortnite (seriously Marvel? thats just sad)
3) Cap being able to wield Thors hammer all of a sudden for no reason at all. (Time travel makes it reconsider whos worthy it seems?)oh and 4 - 14000000) Fortnitehave a good one",positive
"This Is Not A Movie,Not Cinema, This Is A Theme Park",positive
"It's a long film at 3 hours the last one being better because this concludes the 10 year story in at great and satisfying way. The first 2 hours are build up that is ultimately paid off but I felt the middle dragged on I just wanted to get to the end. Infinity war kept me interested the whole time, more than endgame. It's definitely worth the whatch and after you don't have to worry about spoilers.8/10.",positive
"If you are going to do a two-part movie, you need to flesh out the second movie before you make the first one. Infinity Wars - why did Dr Strange give away his stone? - Endgame - I don't know. Infinity Wars - if to take the Soul Stone requires a soul, what happens when you return it? - Endgame - I don't know. Infinity Wars - if there was only one hope for victory, what was it? Endgame - I don't know. Dr Strange refuses to tell and obviously a few Avengers had a chance of taking and using the hand, even in Infinity. So is Dr Strange BS or what? Endgame has the biggest fight scene of the Marvel series but for the most part it was an all-in brawl. Dr Strange's group and Ebony Maw seemed to have a plan but no-one else did. To look real battle scenes do need to be choreographed.
So it's the end of an era and presumably the start of a new one. Afro-Americans did well. They have Black Panther, Cheadle stays on as War Machine (takes over the Ironman position?? )and Falcon becomes Captain America. Women fill a host of secondary positions but only Black Widow has been at the core of the Avengers and Captain Marvel was distanced from the Avengers (ie. underutilised) in Endgame. Black Widow went without any sign of a replacement so yep, we now have an all-male Avenger Squad. WTH?
As a movie Endgame was good but as a sequel and a wind-up of the series, it was lame.",positive
"It's every marvel fans dream come to reality, people can nip pick the time travel but that's not really a flaw because they done it right by giving the fans what they want, the movie has lot of fan services but it never hurts the plot it actually helps it and it shows how much the russo brothers cared about this universe, by time the movie ends you feel like a life time has past, the end of an era.",positive
"For a Marvel movie, this BLUNDERED. It's meant to be the Endgame! The ending everyone's been waiting for! Waiting for the writers to use their magic, but no. The writers got lazy. Time-travel? Are you serious? Time-travel? Despite this obvious critique, I enjoyed it, but it just lacked that typical Avengers magic.",positive
"Continuity? 350M budget and no one looking over the continuity? Hair styles, braided beard..unbraided...braided again? You need special equipment and suits to time travel, but not the bad guys who follow? No one traveling through time ages except Captain America??? SO many dragged out scenes with 'on the nose' dialog. They only made it 3 hours long to give the impression it was 'epic' when it wasn't and isn't. Making Thor a laughing bafoon who gives up being king so he can continue being fat and lazy? If you can't kill your superheroes, turn them into rejects. They'll probably reboot all the characters like they did with Spiderman... again...and again...and again.",negative
"I think it was one of the worst superhero movies. In this film, they destroyed all the preparations made in the previous episode.
It was very good to use the idea of time travel and it could be much better.
The story of getting the stones was written without much thought. All stones were very comfortable. Changes that were ignored in time.
Captain Marvel's role was very empty. The character's presence in the film was really wrong.",positive
Avengers INFINITY WAR was the best in the series so my expectations were low for the follow up. This movie dealt more with substance than style and is completely different than all the other Avenger movies. Definitely the most emotional movie of the series hence why they called it Endgame. Yes it's long but the characters carry the film much more than the action does. I enjoyed the film and may watch it again sometime. It was very good and delivered a fitting end but not the type of Avenger film you would want to watch again and again. That film belongs to INFINITY WAR.,positive
"The 22-movie Infinity Saga of the MCU comes to a close in its best film yet. Avengers: Endgame is everything we wanted and more. It's hilarious, it's action-packed, and has one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a superhero film, let alone any movie. It's full of fan service and nods to the previous films. I don't really have any issues with the film, at least those that are not spoilers anyway. If I had one non-spoiler issue with the film it would be fact that the first hour is a bit slow but afterwards it picks up and never stops. Really any complaints I have with this film is shut out by everything else. My complaints are just nitpicks. It fits its three hour runtime very well and provides a highly satisfying end to the 11 year saga that began with Iron Man in 2008. The MCU has set a new direction and I can't wait to see what happens next.",positive
"Don't listen to the haters, it's amazing! Seriously, this is the movie of the year!",positive
"Absolutely loved it, every character gets a good chunk of screen time and they all use it to full effect, its laugh out loud funny at times, really touching at times.",positive
"Well, endgame is a good movie. Top class action sequences, a coherent story line and all the brilliant much characters clubbed in to one movie.What's not fun though is the whole time travel thing. It's just not believable and feels like something they had to do reverse what thanos had done. The twist where thanos comes back through the time travel loop whole, that is really good. But overall not totally satisfied.However complete blockbuster entertainment as expected. Didn't get bored. Was sad losing stark at the end and black widow, well that was the story ark they wanted to go with.I would say this is a must watch, it's a good watch.",positive
"The soon-to-be most successful movie of all times actually ranks fairly low among its companions. I'd say it is about as good as Winter Soldier.
As a fan of the pevious films, expecially Infinity War, I couldn't miss this one. I think that goes for most movie-goers. After Infinity War, we HAD to see how it ends. Infinity War was an almost perfect movie.
And now we get less than perfect. Now, we get ""good"" or ""very good"" and in comparison it seems almost bad.
My issue is not how the film is made. But with the story they chose to tell:
1. Thanos can't be the stronger villain without his gauntlet. That's poor writing.
2. Captain Marvel and Captain America are NOT equally strong (when fighting Thanos).
3. Stormbreaker was this amazing weapon in Infinity War. It beat Thanos with all stones in his gauntlet. Now it's just as steong as the hammer.
4. Thor has just found his purpose and strength in Ragnarok and Infinity War. Now he is a joke.
5. The time travel is, well, how itz always is. Hardly logical.
Those are the issues that now trouble me after having seen it two days ago. It just wasn't as good as Infinity War. They missed their mark.",positive
"Hawkeye loses his family with the snap. Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space. They are rescued by Captain Marvel. What remains of the Avengers set off to confront Thanos only to find that he had already destroyed the Stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. He is shocked by the new world order and comes up with an idea to save everyone, a Time Heist.This is the 22nd film in the MCU. The best aspect is that it pulls together the whole series of movies and fulfill many of their emotional storylines. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Nebula all get some powerful personal stories. Thor is doing a funny ""The Dude"" Lebowski. Iron Man is his family. Captain America finally gets his love. Hawkeye becomes vengeance. There are some other aspects that I would alter with the Infinity Gauntlet.For Ant-Man, Paul Rudd's comedic takes diminishes his pain from losing Hope. He's not quite as broken as Hawkeye. His lost keeps conflicting with his humor. Black Widow's fight with Hawkeye lasts too long. Sometimes, less is more and doing fewer reversals would add power to each turn. Nebula's final confrontation with herself needs some better work. She needs to have a talk with herself or do an Indiana Jones and shot right away. She could give a punchline like ""I don't like how she looks"". The movie yadayada a lot about time travel. The only explanation is that it's not any of those movies. It's a funny line but it's basically saying that it has no rules. Then the characters say that there are rules. I don't begrudge the MCU for yadayadaing the rules because that could get real complicate. Finally, this MCU ends like many MCU movies, with a chaotic massive final battle. I'd prefer cutting that back and the female Avengers assemble is a little too convenient. Just have two other women. That's enough. It becomes fan service. Overall, the emotional resolutions are great. The recalls to the other movies are satisfying. The story works for the most part. In a franchise that is sure to keep going to infinity, this is a great rest stop to say a few goodbyes.",positive
"Endgame is a good movie, but not a great one.Is it a fitting end for the 20+ movies, hell yes, but still it´s falls short in way too many areas.The plot is what all thought it would be about, with some small twists, but the first 1,5 maybe 2 hours could have been much shorter.When things start to pick up, and we get the epic show down... well... It´s one big LET DOWN :(Again it´s a good movie, but great.... no way.
It´s really a disappointing ending to so many great Marvel movies, as the big battle is over and done before it even starts.Maybe I had too high expectations, and many will disagree, but damn im bummed out about the ending.",positive
"Infinity war was amazing... this... nope. Hollyweird just doesn't know how to finish a story anymore. Paint by numbers and submit to a committee. Was it bad? No. Was it good? No.
Robert Downey Junior is the only good thing in this film.",negative
"A nice conclusion to the saga, it'll give you nerd chills",positive
"Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to ""finish"" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: the character ""powers"" are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other scenes within a given story). That they sometimes ""reduce"" their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, but it's still something that takes me out of the story.What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, I think that's a pretty high compliment.",positive
"I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies.
I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!",positive
"The Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to a point where a film feels like an actual event. We have been waiting in anticipation for a year to see the final showdown that started in Infinity War. Actually, scratch that. The entire Infinity Saga started way back with Iron Man. 22 films, countless number of heroes coming together in the culminating battle against Thanos. So much anticipation, ticketing app crashes, and going through so much to try to see this on opening night. Now here we are. Does Avengers: Endgame live up to its high expectations? Absolutely. I felt like it was unique and carries the most emotional weight off anything in this universe but it absolutely serves its fans who have been loyal for years and years.The film takes place three weeks after the end of Infinity War. Half of the worlds population have been wiped out by Thanos and now the remaining Avengers (who just so happen to consist summarily of the original Avengers) must find a way to not only defeat Thanos, but also avenge the fallen and find a way to counteract the actions that occurred at the end of Infinity War. As expected the film stars a gigantic cast of Hollywood's best and watch out for the cameos from heroes who have appeared previously in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I really would like to talk about this film in a spoiler review but as with every review on my site, there will be no spoilers. I will say that this film has a unique take almost immediately. The humor and banter is still there as it always is and the character arcs are as fantastic as ever at its near completion. The film carries the most emotional weight as anything this universe has seen. The film has so much fan service. I think if you go early on and with a packed crowd of fans you will see just how much this means to the audience who have stayed loyal to this saga.There were laughs, there were cheers, there were gasps, and yes there were tears. The film feels like it should be the very last that the MCU has to offer but of course we know there are Spider-Man and Black Panther sequels coming. The final battle brings just about everything you could hope for. If you're a fan of the series I think you will enjoy this film as it makes a case of being the best Avengers film. It goes hand in hand with Infinity War, of course both films were shot together.Members of the original Avengers put on performances that do their characters the utmost justice after being on this journey for a decade. The film builds up quite slowly but once the plot takes form and the battle lines are drawn it delivers in the way the Russo brothers know how to. Th action is there, and all of what makes the Marvel Universe such a sweeping phenomenon is always there. Some characters could get more screen time, sure. You have to remember that there are so many characters that the film has to juggle and it does that admirably as it is.The film will be a box office hit for sure and will be well reviewed in regards to the Universe as I can already see. I will be seeing this again tomorrow morning and have the same excitement going into a second viewing as I did my first. I found this to be a very special entry and feel like it ties up so much in such a perfect fashion. If you are a fan of superhero fans you need to see this as soon as possible and should do..Whatever it takes.9/10",positive
"This movie is easily the best of all 4 Avengers movies. It's long, but also action packed. The finale is just sooooooooooo amazing! The idea of time travel was just really amazing. Seeing all of the disintegrated heroes come back in the end nearly brought a tear to my eye. This movie is easily a 10/10 for me. I suggest you watch this movie if you haven't seen it, because it is a marvel (no pun intended).",positive
"No spoilers here. Story is unexpected and very original. If you thought you knew what will happen - well, you were wrong.
First half is a bit slow, but still interesting, with all the small pieces coming together.
Second part is full time action, almost as good as Infinity Wars, but a bit weaker in details. I do miss more of Dr. Strange more, but, on the other hand, Captain America was much better than expected. Humor was good, as always.Overall, this is a great movie and a decent ending to the saga. I think everyone will be satisfied.",positive
"I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the ""I can do this all day"" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,.",positive

"To clarify, I am not an MCU fangirl. I enjoy these movies a little more than the casual moviegoer but I definitely do not fit into the diehard category. I enjoy watching most of the films, but would only list the GOTG movies and THOR: RAGNAROK as personal favorites.So just know, this isn't coming from the perspective of some unpleasable geek. It's coming from someone who was emotionally invested in these movies, enjoys most of them, and prizes solid storytelling.And let me tell you, as a story, ENDGAME is a mess.Character development? Forget it! Thor's arc from selfish braggart to responsible king is thrown away so he can be Lebowski 2.0, complete with sunglasses and sweater. The Hulk and Peter Quill are pretty much jokes. Tony Stark gets one of the cheapest deaths in modern cinema-- it feels less like a natural culmination of the character's growth and more like RDJ wanted to make sure he wasn't shoehorned into more movies through 2050.And don't get me started on how the events of this film are going to wreck GOTG 3. Let's just say all Gamora's character development is in the trash now. I know plenty of people who love the GOTG movies but have no interest in any other Marvel property and they'll be confused as hell come 2021. (I really do not get people who claim these MCU films work as self-alone pictures. 9.5 times out of 10, they really don't at all.)ENDGAME continues the trend of CAPTAIN MARVEL in throwing continuity to the winds. What happened to Thor's hammer NOT being the source of his power? Now, Steve Rogers can use it to toss lighting everywhere like a rogue Pikachu. Peter Parker goes back to high school in 2023 and somehow Ned is still a teen attending--- even though he was one of the confirmed not-deaths after INFINITY WAR. Steve Roger's wild time travel ride at the end will also screw future timeline continuity up in ways I shudder to contemplate. I pity the screenwriters is all I gotta say.I won't say this movie is the worst. Compared to something like, say, THE LAST JEDI, which had the most formless, meandering plot, ENDGAME moves quickly and does not overstay its welcome. There are some truly fun fight scenes and one-liners. The final battle in particular is marvelous, giving me some of the most fun I've had in a theater in a while (though it could have just been the enthusiasm of the crowd working its magic on me).But I'm not going to pretend this is an epic finale. It was so unsatisfying a conclusion for the original Avengers team that it kind of taints what came before. What enthusiasm I had for the MCU to come wasn't exactly high (nothing good lasts forever, as many a former successful franchise has shown Hollywood time and time again), but now, my hopes are nil.EDIT: I found out that Thor's hammer does allow worthy wielders his power, so I rescind my ""rogue Pikachu"" complaint. The movie is still frustrating though.",positive
"My 10 year old nephew LOVES super heroes and he's watched all Marvel and DC movies, but after 30+ minutes into this one he says: ""This movie is no good. We are wasting our time"".I couldn't agree more. We forced ourselves to continue watching though, maybe it would get better. It didn't. At times we both laughed at how bad it was.The 10 year old who (again) LOVES super hero movies suddenly stopped watching while there was still 40 minutes left, he just went out to play instead. At this point I couldn't care less of how things turned out at the end so I just turned it off prematurely.Just an indication of how failed this movie was, in our opinion.",negative
"Endgame is certainly one of its kind. A movie that will be marked as the film of this decade. Building up from Iron Man to Captain Marvel, a 10 journey filled with joy, adventure and tears. And we need a perfect ending to all of that. Endgame is the perfect ending. A movie that has everything a fan will ever dream of, an amazing cast and a wonderful climax. It is such a huge payoff from 10 years worth of building up. To look at this from a Fan's perspective, it is an awesome movie and it is a masterpiece. But to look at this from a critic's perspective, it is not the best movie. It certainly lacks some elements to a perfect movie. But this to me, is such a wonderful movie and I definitely loved it. It has everything I wanted and I'm gonna give this movie a 9/10.",positive
"Well...most of them.The film opens on Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye with his happy family...until he no longer has one on account of them being dusted, which causes him to become vengeful Mohawkeye. Next up it's my least favourite Avenger, Tony Snark, teaching games to Nebula (my favourite Guardian of the Galaxy and the only one of those a-holes I actually LIKE. Mantis, who I also like and who *isn't* an a-hole, sadly only gets one line in the movie, but at least it's a funny one). The term drawn-out could be used to describe this whole opening with Tony. 'Self-indulgent' would be another. Just because you have a 3-hour+ runtime, Russos, doesn't mean you should waste it lingering on Tony sleeping, etc. I did appreciate, though, that Nebula shows she's grown (as evidenced by the fact she's refrained from beating the snot out of Tony the entire time they've been stuck in space together). I was happy to see her featured so much.Thankfully things finally get moving once Captain Marvel saves their butts and interacts with the team in a scene most have probably watched already. As she points out to Rhodey Rude (whose main role seems to be Joke/Movie Reference Man), she's been on other planets after 'The Snap' that *didn't* have The Avengers to help them out. The fact that THOR says he likes her should be enough (though obviously won't be for certain people). He also learns from the mistake he made at the end of Infinity War regarding what bodypart to aim for on Thanos (who apparently wiped out half the universe's populace so he could become a farmer and unfortunately destroyed the Infinity Stones). Too bad Nebula's robbed of the chance to end Thanos in this movie (twice!), as she probably deserved to the most. Tony the Drama Queen proves he hasn't grown at all, laying the blame for everything at Cap's feet.A skip to five years later reveals time hasn't been kind to Thor. I'm saddened to see him reduced to this joke, when the first Thor movie is one of my favourites. They've veered too far into 'comedy' for my taste, as here he's played mostly for laughs on account of letting himself go (for those wanting shirtless Thor, you'll get him...though you'll wish you *hadn't*). Bless Paul Rudd's Scott Lang, as he brings a breath of fresh air to proceedings. His reunion with his (now grown) daughter is one of the few genuinely effective emotional moments in the film. Unfortunately, he's not given the respect he deserves, considering he's the one to come up with the idea of time travel (the subject of which is given the ultimate nerd discussion in this film). They go to Tony, who selfishly refuses to help the others get back everyone they lost since he already HAS everyone HE wants (well...except for Spider-Kid, who is the reason he eventually changes his mind).Cut to after a 'comedic' sequence involving working out the kinks of time-travelling, the gang splits up to retrieve all the stones from the past. This is where the film kicks into gear, as we revisit past MCU films and encounter previous versions of characters. Highlights include: Cap seeing Peggy Carter again, Cap vs Past Cap, Thor spending some precious time with his soon-to-be-deceased mother (plus, a Jane cameo! There's actually lots of cameos in the film, but only a few I cared about) and twice the amount of Nebula. There's one rage-inducing consequence of visiting the past involving Mohawkeye, Natasha and the Soul Stone. If you remember what happened with Gamora, you'll know what that means. Although the character who ends up being the sacrifice gets some good character/emotional beats in this film, it still doesn't make up for the fact they're unceremoniously given the 'permadeath' treatment, thus robbing us of one of the MCU's best characters and the awesome dynamics between them and other characters. Given all the others that could've been offed, WHY'd it have to be...well...you'll see.I'll give the film credit for seamlessly blending the 'present' characters with the past, and once things reach the climax, they definitely ensure this is the most 'epic' battle we've seen yet which involves pretty much every character (except those who're unfortunate enough to *stay* dead, of course), some of which will be getting future films or TV shows to appear in. I guess that's meant to 'make up for' them not getting much screentime here (like my fave, Wanda. At least she gets some revenge on Thanos and shares an emotional moment with Mohawkeye near the end. I'm looking forward to her show and hopefully future movie appearances too). Captain America gets at least two cheer-worthy moments, while Captain Marvel and her new haircut get to kick some major arse (don't fret, haters...she isn't given the final victory over Thanos. No, we all know who gets THAT privilege).I guess I was supposed to feel sad near the end, but honestly I just felt relief, as it's about time a certain someone faced some actual real consequences. Hopefully other characters will get to thrive/have substantial screentime now that somebody isn't hogging it all. Another good thing about the end is the camera shot which slowly moves through/covers everyone (all these characters we've come to know, plus a few we haven't yet) at the funeral. The BEST part, however, is the final scene. I've waited ever since the first Cap movie (my other fave MCU film) to get to the scene that ends this movie, and I think it's worth it. I'm so very happy with it and who it involves.While there're no mid-credits/post-credits scenes, it's worth sticking around to see the original six Avengers actors literally signing off. It'll probably take a couple of viewings to fully digest this film, as it throws in everything AND the kitchen sink. It's a fitting conclusion to Phase 3 (ignoring Spider-Kid 2). Now, bring on Phase 4!",positive
"Movie is good no second thoughts about it, but it is far from being great. I felt little disappointed for how Marvel handled Time Travel in Endgame. There's eventually no cause and effect phenomenon in this movie. One can do what ever they want in past and still nothing gets affected in current (future timeline). Nebula kills her pastself but current Nebula should also have erased from existence, but we didn't see that.
Overall it's good but time travel could have been depicted differently.
Characters literally messed a lot with past self still there was no consequence. Thor brought Mjolnir with him in future leaving no weapon for past Thor.
If Tony stole that Teseract then Fury would never have got access to Tesseract but that too doesn't seem to have any affect on current timeline.
Disappointed with time travel philosophy of Endgame.And story felt bit not too much but bit exaggerated. Movie could have been shortened by 20 minutes easily.
There were several scenes which felt unnecessary and several scenes were not showed, like how Thanos was able to bring whole army to current timeline if Nebula took only one tube of Pym Particle.
The action sequences are great and VFX is just amazing. I didn't find any problems in CGI.
It great but still it doesn't deserve 10/10.",positive
"I thought the first hour and a half was a little slow but is needed for the story and the second hour and a half is some of the best cinema you will see. Some of the best spine tingling moments, including captain America With Thor's hammer, the moment Black Panther and others come back and when all the woman of the universe team up for a moment with Thanos. Also as Captain America is my favourite superhero the ending of his character was really fitting.",positive
"This is the best mcu movie ever ! This film is rich in emotions and humor, this show perfectly concludes this time of 22 films !",positive
"Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one...
A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second!
Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years.
Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around.
It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket.
Stan Lee would be proud! Nuff said!",positive
"Enjoyable movie that takes to long to get into the action and doesn't make any sense once you step back and think about what they've done. Even their explanations on what they were going to do, what they did do, and the final outcomes make no sense. I believe the world would be an even bigger mess when they were done, and Steve broke all the rules!",positive
"Nothing is perfect, this movie is not perfect and yes it could have been better but it is a fitting conclusion to the Avengers saga and sad that we will not be some characters again in their super hero forms. There will be tears in the theaters so get ready. As for analyzing this movie, I recommend getting a PhD if you have to go into minute details. This is a movie and it will have plotholes, so enjoy it for what it is and the effort put into it.I watched this in IMAX yesterday and watching it again in Dolby in a few days with my family. Thank you to all the hard work put into this movie. Thank you Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Doctor Strange, and many more.....my son was born in 2008 and you guys have served as an inspiration for us all. Thank you.",positive
"No spoilers!!Being a sceptic of Marvel movies for a long time, I had low expectations going into Endgame. I didn't love Infinity War, but I wanted to see this film opening weekend to avoid spoilers and see how the 10-year culmination of the MCU concluded. Well, I was pleasantly surprised with the film. It's not without its issues, but Endgame felt like one of the most unique and captivating Marvel films to date. I was very surprised at how easily I was engaged throughout the 3-hour runtime. The film breaks down into three parts, each part having its pros and cons. Personally, I thought the first act was the weakest and overstayed its welcome. Despite that, there were still some interesting parts that helped flesh out the aftermath of Infinity War. The second and third act felt very original and had many surprising moments that kept me guessing what would happen next. However, there were parts that felt VERY fan servicey. Of course, some of the fan service was fine, but at other points it felt like a little much.One of the great things about this movie was that it broke from the simple MCU formula. It has a much different story than any of the other MCU films and utilizes much different plot mechanisms to make it feel more original. The emotional range of the film was another thing that felt different to me compared to many other MCU films. I thought the humor in this film was handled much better, causing me to laugh multiple times. Not only was the film funny at points, but it also had some sad, depressing, exciting, and thrilling sequences. This film, unlike some other MCU films, was able to have some very serious moments and did not have to cut the emotional tension by inserting a cheesy one-liner.Despite it being a much more original and emotionally driven film compared to other MCU films, it did have some shortcomings. I think that some of the fan service took me out of the film because it felt either overdramatic or forced. There were times were I caught myself rolling my eyes at how overdramatic or socially 'woke' the movie was being. One scene in particular felt like a blatant advertisement in the middle of the film, which was jarring and cringe worthy. There were also many moments of the film that could have been explained to help bring more tension, but instead were brushed over in order to fit everything into a reasonably lengthed film. I think there were parts that should have been cut or shorted and other parts that should have been extended. Lastly, I thought that Thanos was misused in this film. I was excited to see his role in this film but was left disappointed by his role as the villain.As someone who wouldn't consider themselves a Marvel fan, I had fun watching this movie regardless of it having some issues. I would definitely recommend it if you have been following the MCU at all recently, but I probably don't need to do that because everyone and there mother is going to see this. Overall, I thought it was enjoyable and quite possibly my favorite Marvel film.P.S. It feels satisfying to have this chapter of superhero movies come to a close. I hope that it will make way for more innovative and interesting films, whether they are superhero related or not.",positive
"Don't get me wrong, the movie is actually solid in terms of acting and special effects, being it way too long. The big issue here is that 'Infinity War' raised the bar so high, this is just an unworthy sequel. In three hours of movie, you actually get some credible story for no more than 10 minutes. The time-travel solution always looked likely but how it developed was way too predictable. There are way too many plot holes and easy way outs for the story to actually go where it is supposed to go. Some of the heroes are conveniently placed in certain situations out of nowhere and the impending happy ending is always pretty clear to whoever puts some thought rather than just trying to be entertained! I would not watch this again, probably never, unlike 'Infinity War'.",negative
"Flicking through the ratings I saw a lot of 1/10 and a lot of 10/10. For me, it was like any other avengers movie, it was kinda epic. But still, 10/10 is a bit overrated.A lot of trends they inject into movies these days aggravate me. You can look at any superhero movie, Marvel or DC, since fortnite was booming it was somehow featured in the movies. The same can be said for political movements or protests/marches (LGBTQ-acceptance, feminism etc.). I don't mind them, but I don't need to be reminded of them by seeing them in every movie I go to watch.I think that this is the movie for a passionate marvel-fan, but it isn't the end of the world if you don't see it.",positive
"This movie was incredible, it did everything I wanted it to do and every character had their time to shine, the film was the culmination of 22 MCU films and ten years of buildup and the film pulled it off beautifully. This film could have turned out as a mess if it was in the wrong hands, but the Russo brothers have masterfully pulled off an awesome and emotionally satisfying finale to the Avengers franchise and MCU series even though we are getting more films with ""Spider-Man: A Long Way From Home"" coming out later this yearOverall, the film was everything it needed to be and the hefty 3 hour run time was definitely more than necessary. The film did everything I expected and much much more, closing a chapter on pop culture history and a franchise loved by billions, it was as close to perfect as a film like this can get",positive
"I will keep this first part of the review short, but add some footnotes (indexed with <#> symbols) to a ""spoiler section"" below the trailer videofurther down. Proceed at your peril if you haven't yet seen it!The MCU has delivered an impressively well-connected movie series. In the case of Thanos, this is a story-arc that started in the mid-credit ""monkey"" at the end of 2012's ""The Avengers"" and, at the conclusion of ""Avengers: Infinity War"", saw half the universe's population drift away - Voldemort-style - into grey ash. This, of course, also wiped out half of our heroes. This included Spider-Man (Tom Holland); Dr Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch); Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman); Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson); half of the remaining Guardians; The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and Dr Pym (Michael Douglas). Oblivious to all of this is Ant Man (Paul Rudd), still stranded in the 'quantum realm' following the demise of his colleagues, and with no one to flick the 'return' switch.After some early action, Endgame's story revolves around a desperate attempt by the remaining Avengers, led by Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a 'retired' Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr) to undo the undoable. Can they succeed against all the odds? (With a new Spider-Man film due out in the summer, I'll give you a guess!). Of more relevance perhaps is whether the team can stay unscathed from their encounter with the scheming and massively powerful Thanos (Josh Brolin)?The film will not be to every fan's taste. After the virtually non-stop rip-roaring action of ""Infinity War"", ""Endgame"" takes a far more contemplative approach to its first hour.The film starts with a devastating prologue, and a great lesson in statistics: that you need a decent sized population to guarantee getting a 50:50 split! There is also a very surprising twist in the first 15 minutes or so that I didn't see coming AT ALL.But then things settle down into a far more sombre section of the film: short on action; long on character development. The world is grieving for its loss, unable to move on past the non-stop counselling sessions that everyone is getting. This first hour was, for me, by far, my favourite part of the film. Seeing how the characters we know and love have been impacted - some for better rather than for worse - was terrific. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk (with a rather glib plot-point) takes on an hilarious new aspect; and Chris Hemsworth adds hugely comedic value as Thor, setting up in Scotland a ""New Asgard"" settlement in uncharacteristically laid-back fashion.As an ensemble cast, everyone plays their parts extremely well. But it is just the breadth of the cast that astounds in this film: just about everyone who is anyone in the Marvel Universe - at least, those who are still alive (alive!) and not dead (dead!) - pop up for an appearance! This is great fun with, in one particular case, the opportunity to try some more rejuvenation of an old timer as previously done with Samuel L. Jackson in ""Captain Marvel"".Inevitably, some of these appearances are overly brief, and characters that I wanted to see developed more in this film (particularly Brie Larson's Captain Marvel) get very little screen time. Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) barely get a single line each. So it will depend on where your loyalties lie as to whether you are satisfied with the coverage or not. (I personally find Chris Evans' Captain America a bit of a po-faced bore, so I wasn't keen on the amount of screen time he had).Stan Lee again gets another cameo in the bag before his demise: will this actually be his last live one?Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It could obviously NEVER live up to the over-hyped expectations of the fan base. But as a cinematic spectacle, for me, it delivered on its billing as a blockbuster finale, but one filled with a degree of nuance I was not expecting. The problem with the way that the plot have been structured (no spoilers - <#>) is that it is easy to pick holes in the storyline. Indeed, some dramatic options (that to me seemed obvious ones to 'mine') were left 'unmined' <##>; others were left inexplicably hanging <###>.I suspect the reason for some of this is that the initial cut of this film probably ran to 5 hours rather than the - still bladder-testing - 3 hours as released. There were probably a bunch of scenes left on the cutting room floor that might allow things to make more sense in the extended BluRay release.It's at times slow, but for me never dull. It does suffer from one significant flaw though: the ""Return of the King"" disease. It doesn't know when to quit. There was a natural MCU arc to follow and a perfect time at which to end it: but the directors (the Russo Brothers, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo) kept adding additional scenes that detracted from the natural ending <####>.Above all, unlike I think all but one film in MCU history, there is NO ""MONKEY"" (end-credit scene) in the end credits: either mid-credit or end-credit! So, after the long title crawl (and some rather odd choices for end-title music by Alan Silvestri), if you are not to look bloody stupid as the lights come up, and face a storm of derision from your partner, then leave after the dramatic roll-call sequence of the film's stars!******SPOILER SECTION*****
Do not read beyond this point if you've not watched the film!<#>
The ""plot-hole picking"" business I referenced is of course the time-travelling element of the plot. First up, Stark's discovery of the mobius strip McGuffin is nicely done and his moral torment at disrupting the idyllic life he's built is relatable. But this timey-wimey stuff tends to play havoc with logic.....<##>
The missed opportunity I saw was the killing of Nebula (the younger) by Nebula (the elder) (both Karen Gillan). If it had been the other way round, I *might* have understood it. But surely this way round, Nebula the elder would have ceased to exist to go back in time in the first place? That's obviously a paradox! It would at least have been more satisfying if Nebula the elder had ""ashed"" away or something: literally a self-sacrifice for the greater good. Perhaps I've missed something and need to watch it again!<###>
My other question would be what happened to her sister Gamora? She was alive and kicking (hard) in one scene, but then not mentioned further: just a pining Star Lord (Chris Pratt) looking at her picture? Again, maybe I missed something!What was particularly joyous was seeing a plethora of great faces on the screen: Rene Russo (no immediate relation to the directors!) as Thor's mother; Natalie Portman, reprising her role of Jane Porter from the first Thor films (so brief, it was clearly constructed from cut footage or something); Michael Douglas, old and young, as Dr Pym and particularly Robert Redford. (So THIS, not ""The Old Man and the Gun"", is his ""final film"" then!!?)My previous reservations (from ""Captain Marvel"") about the superior fire-power of Captain Marvel also held true. Although she had ""all the other planets"" around the universe to cater for (""Fair point""), when she did turn up she ripped through Thanos's ship like paper (as she did in her own film). And yet she couldn't rip her way through Thanos? And a stone-less Thanos at that!This really made no sense to me. In ""Infinity War"" you could rationalise that the REASON the combined efforts of The Avengers to attack and remove the glove of Thanos failed was BECAUSE he was immensely powerful by having four of the five stones. In the battle scene in ""Endgame"" he had the better of Stark, Thor, Captain America AND Marvel but without any stones in his possession. Or have I missed something yet again here?<####>
My view of the finale was that it should have ended with the (rather CGI'd) funeral pan round the assembled characters (including a few randoms... I understand the young teen on his own was the kid who helped Stark in ""Iron Man Three""). While the Captain America time travelling piece that followed was sweet and all, it's been done before (in Mel Gibson's ""Forever Young"" for example) and for me wasn't worth the minutes invested in it at the end of an already long film.So, where will we go from here then in the MCU universe? Stan Lee is dead; Stark is dead; Black Widow is dead (though - as Amy Andrews points out, in her excellent review of the movie - she's been criminally underused). There will no doubt be further MCU films: ""SpiderMan: Far From Home"" opens in the summer; surely we are due ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain Marvel"" follow-ups; ; and Ant-Man and the Wasp have barely scratched the surface together. But will we ever get to see another ""Avengers-style"" story arc that traverses and connects the characters again in a similar way? Only the timey-wimey stuff will tell.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.)",positive
"Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation.",positive
Truely ..... Best.... Just want if Captain Marvel did not showed up...... Only that character make the film out of perfection.,positive
"After waiting for a year, Avengers: Endgame hit the theatres and shattered a number of box office records worldwide. But, was it really so perfectly great? No.Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried it's best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least.Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical.Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is messed up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't.Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience.Rating.Score : 8.9/10Grade : A",positive
"Watching Avengers Endgame started as a nice story that soon became boring and predictable. The problem is that it's supposed to end an era, to be a big moment before the curtain fall, but instead tries to pave the way for Marvell phase 4. There were some interesting moments, some funny moments that really made me smile, but at the end it all fell flat. Flat as a rug. They tried to cram each and everyone in the movie, but in my opinion it feels fake, like parading with fake cardboard masks. The CGI-fest soon became boring...except for the de-aging of Michael Douglas, that was 100% uncanny valley material. I was watching it feeling nothing, feeling dead inside. Then the woke trend rear its ugly head. Anyway, it's safe to say that I'll avoid Marvel in the future. The Endgame should stay the endgame. It's time to move on.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is quite possibly the most hyped up movie of all time. The excitement surrounding this films release is a dream come true for Marvel Studios and Disney. With that being said, I have looked forward to this film since it was called Infinity War Part 2 back in 2015 or so. I really enjoyed my time watching this and it marked the end of an era. I finally realized a couple years ago how much the MCU means to me and how much these characters mean to me that I gladly would accept anything this movie did.The CGI was good, but the green screen showed a little bit (meaning the backgrounds looked fake sometimes), the performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans were great because they treated this movie seriously, the cameos in here felt welcomed and the amount of locations in this movie really make it feel like the Avengers are desperate to go anywhere and do anything to save their fallen friends. With all this being said this is a very well made movie worth your time and money.",positive
"I liked the movie, but I agree with some of the other reviewers, it was very much hyped up, but I feel like someone let the air out of my balloon while I wasn't looking.First off, love Iron Man. Was really surprised that he is one of the Avengers that is sacrificed at the end. Is he really gone? Not sure...kinda thinking he did some mastermind stuff to live on in some capacity.And then they take Cap away. An old man now...(sheesh). I do understand that Chris didn't want to play this role anymore. It's been 8 years, but hey, I could have taken a few more. And in the comics, the mantle goes to Bucky to continue as Captain America. Well right now, Bucky is just hanging out to dry (as he has been lately).And although I see that they tried to throw some humor in there, why in the world did they make Thor a drunk and fat. Really????And why did they even put Danvers in there for? OK...she found Iron Man and brought him home and then destroys Thanos' ship only. I thought she was supposed to save the day. All the hoopla with building her up in Captain Marvel (which don't get me started as to how much of that movie didn't mesh with the comics).I don't know, but the whole fighting scene was a bit much. Some things just didn't make much sense. Why is Thanos so strong all of a sudden (with no stones)?And I just don't think that certain Avengers got their fair share of screen time and some received too much.And finally, there were just holes all over the place. I'm not sure where the MCU goes from here, but I'm here for it (that's for sure).",positive
"After infinity war which IMO is the best of all the avenger movies, I was really looking forward to the conclusion.Well, what a disappointment. The story made no sense at all. There was no character progression with Thor almost non existence! How can this be with him being the almighty god of thunder commanding the bi-frost in infinity war?!That pace or the movie was slow and boring, the acting lethargic with a real lack of fun.I found myself forwarding large chunks of this movie just to get to something good!The ending was a total shambles and pathetic! Total Hollywood cheese which really didn't work.They will no doubt make another Captain America movie so why end it like that? Passing the title of CA to someone else when they don't even have superpowers?!!The more I think about it the worse it is.Just a money making ending with no thought or direction.Should have left it with infinity war.",negative
"First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.I laughed, lots.
I cried, lots.
I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots
I even punched the air in a ""go on!"" during one sceneI can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.Go with it. Enjoy the ride.Soak up every second, it doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.I have nothing else to say.10/10.

"Wow, almost all the heroes in one place, what a great ending for avengers' movie. The old and the new scenes blended together with smoothly, i'm amazed. But the things that too weird for me, that the captain america was getting old, and he had given the shield to Sam with what purpose? maybe because his retirement (enjoyed life with his lovely one). My idol black widow faced her death just like gomora, Iron Man too because of all the stones, OMG, I'm very sad. Still i adore all Marvel's movies.",positive
"It's fair to say that this is a fitting climax not only to the avengers movies, but a large section of the Marvel universe. The film is action packed, generally keeps you at the edge of your seat, and remains faithful to the characters. It's long, but quite necessarily so.",positive
"Oh boy, let´s go, then: Avengers: Endgame was one of the movie I was REALLY anxious to see. After IW, the bar was really high. So, I though the bar would be as high or even higher. Unfortunately I was wrong. I´ll make my opinion this way:POSITIVES:Acting was superb, in general, but RDJ's was top.CGISoundtrack
NEGATIVES:First one and simply put...this is not an action movie, it´s a drama with some scenes of action. When you go to an action movie you don´t hear many people crying during the movie, do you?Pace too slow. The first 2 hours are quite boring. Then you get some 20 minutes of good action;So, the villain that was unbeatable in the first movie is killed in the first minutes of the movie? Right...Time travel usually gives some headaches after. That are several in this movie, like future Nebula killing the past Nebula and still, being able to exist all the same;The way they treated Hulk again was a joke. In the last movie it was offensive. In this, you have a nice smart Hulk, that barely fights;The way they treated Thor. Now his beard is massive, he doesn´t take bath and mostly, he´s a fat drunk;Too much time was spent on Haweye. Who cares about him?Remember how hard was to beat Thanos with IG? Forget it, know Thor, Cap (with Thor´s Mjolnir) and Iron Man can´t beat him, even with Thanos not having the IG. In fact, not even the OP Captain Marvel can do it. The only one was SW;Captain Marvel, every time she appears, shows how much powerful she is. But, forget it, she´s out about 97% of the movie;The gathering of the team was forced and lame;Quill has little time. Just some few minutes;Dr. Strange and SW have even less time;Cap. and Stark interaction was short, as usual;Pepper now is kind of a Iron Woman. She appears in the final battle...! What???;Hulk could handle the IG, but they had to put Iron Man due it in order to kill him. Sorry, that´s too much for me.Such a massive of opportunity they had here. They could even given us a better movie than IW...",positive
"DISCLAIMER- This is a spoiler FREE reviewWell, here we are.After 11 year's of top quality entertainment and planning that started all the way back with 2008's surprise smash hit Iron Man (do you feel old yet? I sure do), this part of Marvel's world domination comes to an end with what's likely to be one of, if not the biggest film's of all time, The Avengers: Endgame.It's a somewhat odd, occasionally emotional and fitting experience sitting back and concluding this part of the Marvel universe and while we know there's countless more Marvel film's coming our way, Endgame really does feel like the culmination of year's of hard work and adventures, that while not perfect, feels like a fitting tribute to what's come before and what still lays ahead.It's incredibly hard to talk about Endgame in depth without ruining the narrative the Russo brother's and their team have created but suffice to say the creative minds behind the scenes have given us another top quality piece of blockbuster filmmaking, that's likely to please diehard fans and more casual cinemagoers alike, the only problem is, when compared to it's genuinely surprising and perfectly paced predecessor, Endgame does feel slightly more formulaic and long in the tooth.It's picky for sure, but Infinity War gave us a Marvel experience that was unexpected, hilarious, emotional and epic and while Endgame has this in parts, it's not as all encompassing as last year's experience, even if by the rulebook, this was never going to be the case when tying up so many loose ends and finalising so much of what has come before it over the year's.A lot of these endings and plot tie ups will please those that have invested so much into a series that has been operating on an extremely high level for a number of year's, it's just that Marvel almost outdid themselves in Infinity War, making the more by the numbers plot threads and leaps of logic found in Endgame more highlighted than usual.The other minor nitpick with the film is Endgames much talked about epic 3 hour runtime and while the film starts with some unexpected and emotionally charged instances, there's a clear late beginning and middle section of the film that at times drags and cover's similar ground one too many times, even if by relative terms, the runtime in the Russo's film never is too detrimental to the fun to be had.This fun comes in many forms, with particular highlights being Thor's new found lifestyle, the Hulk's more prominent role and Captain Marvel's addition to the Avengers family, while the films big action scenes (that must be said aren't that abundant) are a sight to behold, with Marvel once more showing off their ability to handle spectacles as good as, if not better than, everyone else.At the end of the day, it's been an incredible period for Marvel, with arguably no outright failures and an abundance of big winners, we've been spoilt for 11 straight year's and while Endgame may not be the best of the best, it's still a mighty fine and emotionally charged finale that does the beloved cinematic universe proud.Final Say -While not as surprising or even as Infinty War, Endgame is still a top quality and fitting end to so much good work that's come before it and while it's sad to say goodbye to this particular era, it's exciting to see what lays in store for Marvel moving ahead.4 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of 5",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is not a bad movie at all. It's just not what it's made out to be - supposedly one of the greatest movies of all time. Sure, you have seasoned actors who deliver the necessary emotions which are put into scene well enough and several strings from other movies and tv series are tied together. But that alone doesn't make a movie great per se, that's just good planning.The story itself is your basic time travel retcon and there aren't any clever twists that were hidden in Infinity War. 2 out of 3 hours of the movie is characters talking as a fan service, one hour is plot advancement. You get your deus ex machina (Captain Marvel) who tips the balance this time while she was conveniently absent in the last movie. You get Iron Man, who doesn't even have superhuman abilities, performing a feat that should have killed him right away according to the lore.The movie is satisfying yes, but that doesn't make it great. Nothing of what happens is particularly awe inspiring, surprising or new. With all the talking, it rather feels like a double episode that finishes off a tv show.And to be honest, placing this among the greatest movies of all time feels like an insult to the great ones which excel in all possible departments - acting, story, score, cinematogrpahy, blocking etc. But I guess a generation that votes for a president who promises to make America great again can also vote such a movie as one of the greatest. Both aren't.",positive
"Minor spoilers.This is not the film I expected after the last Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). If you missed ""Ant-man and the Wasp"" that has an important tie-in. Brie Larson was in the film far less than expected. When you have so many Avengers on the screen at one time, it is hard for anyone to get a major part.After they did the Blues Brothers, we are getting the band back routine, they did a very awkward ""Back to the Future"" movie that did not work as well as planned. I expected Nebula would trick Thanos and get some stones followed by the mother of all battles led by Captain Marvel. They didn't make that film.The production had some good laugh lines and some hold back the tears moments. Not to give away too much, but it was rumored some stars didn't want to do the series anymore. They were given a Captain Kirk exit.And yes, there is, of course, the mother of all Avenger's battle which will be hard to top.Stan Lee as a driver.",positive
I gave this movie five stars for effects but for story not so great and i expected at this happy ending i didn't expect that bit of drama but anyway dissapointed especially the way Thanos end in the movie so lame exactly like NK in GOT so lame when you expect at something more but no this is a proof if you rush something you ruin it the note is 8.7 just because effects and is marvel nothing more.,positive
A garbage with full of unpleasant characters and boring story and i call that a real charlatanism to stole your money and giving you a 3 hours long headache with minimum suspense and bad cgi and nothing more. i hope we never saw that characters anymore and never have such garbage anymore.,negative
"Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie, but it feels like one. Every character get an end to their arcs, and the film itself is a great conclusion to 11 years of movies, all of which have led up to this. I wont spoil the actual plot for those who haven't seen it (the trailers have been incredible at not revealing anaything), but I will say that it is full of surprises, shocks, laughs and tears. The fact that the film manages to be THIS good more than makes up for its few flaws. The final battle is probably the most fan-pleasing, epic and emotionaly packed action sequence in any superhero movie; it was the culmiation if 11 years of characters we've come to love and care about. This is what superhero movies are all about.",positive
This movie was really good. I remember my self screaming at the movies sooooo bad along with every other fan! I watched this movie 2 times at the cinema! It was something else!

"I laughed, I cried, I exclaimed, I cried, I laughed, I cried and then I kept crying.Rest assured, the writers do these characters every justice they deserve, by closing long running arcs beautifully, albeit, sadly. It is a painful goodbye to the Infinity Arc but they've done it superbly. The endgame of over 22 films, a saga spanning 11 years has culminated into something so powerful, so awe inspiring on the screen, I urge every one to watch it to feel firsthand, the beauty, the pain and triumph of our heroes.The movie picks up right where the previous left off. It allows the viewer some time to cope with the devastation wrecked by Thanos in the previous film. It is remarkable and therefore worth noting that every trailer issued for this movie comes in the first 20 mins of the movie and hence everything afterwards is such a whirlwind. The movie gives nod to some of our favourite moments in the past films and still continues to give.You will have many naysayers. Dont listen to them. The movie is powerful. The effects, the music, the story, the emotions. Its honestly a hell of a ride.Stan Lee is up there somewhere, smiling. And we too will learn to smile through our tears.",positive
"Movie wasnt bad but it was def overhyped..Ending was great..Cant really beat Cap saying ""Avengers Assemble"" but still..Hawkeye I thought too much screen time..Some parts were generally boring, probably not enough action overall IMO..Beginning was kind of boring I thought..I definitley liked Infinity War better..Expected a lot more after IW but this didnt live up to what I had hoped for but meh I'll still go see it again so somehow it wins in the end..lol 🤣🤣🤣",positive
"Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame.

"By no stretch of the imagination does this movie deserve a spot next to Dark Knight, Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Inception, Shawshank Redemption or any where within the top 100 movies. It was alright. Not revelatory. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. That was awesome. They captured the emotion perfectly, it was sad, but appropriate. This had some feel-good moments with massive collaboration from most of the entire universe. Also, this movie could possibly have elevated to an 8 if they put Deadpool in...that would have been awesome and hilarious. It was not overly thought-provoking. It was just a little above the average popcorn Marvel movie-nothing truly profound, just fun verbal quips and too much fighting and too many missions that somehow ends alright (not amazingly though).",positive

"Believe it or not, I expected this storyline. That Thanos would destroy the stones and Avengers will move on until they find a way to travel back in time. I said I hope it wasn't using Quantum realm because it would be repeatable. And that's exactly what happened.The movie is plagued by plot holes. I will not go over all of them but I spent over an hour after the movie listing all the plot holes to my daughter. The biggest and the most ridiculous one is that the Avengers had only enough Pym particles for one round trip each. Movie made a big deal about this. But towards the end, Thanos uses one vial of Pym particle on his ship with everyone on board. With thousands of minion creatures on it. With no special ""Quantum"" suit or equipment. You mean to tell me Avengers could've just got on a vehicle and teleport all together with one vial? And with Hank Pym back now, they can time travel at will from now on. Or go back in time to get more just like they did in the movie. This completely ruins the Marvel Universe.Avengers can travel back in time where they first made the Ironman version of Infinity Gauntlet. Borrow it, defeat any villain with a snap, and return it to exact moment. Avengers of the past will understand since they did same thing when retrieving the stones.Also now everyone is Antman. Everyone can shrink, go to Quantum realm, and time travel. Nothing special about Antman now. These are just fraction of all the plot holes.There also was a huge plot hole fail in The Last Jedi when Holdo sliced Snoke's mothership by going lightspeed. Which ruined the Star Wars Universe. And these rivals that plot hole.Their version of time travel is a big mess too. It says past and future is not connected and changing past doesn't effect future but there are parts where it shows the new past effecting the future. And they were making fun of Back to the Future.",positive
"Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I were a real Marvel fanboy, although from reading the other reviews I might well have cause to doub that, but as someone coming to this film through all the hype, and the knowledge that this has just outgrossed Avatar in terms of the box office I am simply astonished how lacklustre this film is.Sometimes I dislike a film, and rail against it while secretly having quite enjoyed it, the objection being to some aspect of the film which annoyed me, maybe something ideological or political. But despite Marvel increasingly taking a political line on many things there is really very little in this film - at least on the surface - that one could find objectionable about it. In many ways in fact it is very routine and unobjectionable. But problem mainly relates to the film's obesity & overblown nature combined with a manufactured self-indulgence that was just annoying to watch.With respect to the latter this is mainly with reference to the final battle (where everyone who's anyone in the Marvel Universe makes an appearance) and the tying up of things in the post-coital glow: I get that this has been a long, epic and much loved journey for many film-goers, and also that fans will want a proper send-off etc for their favourites, but unfortunately this is done really badly, & inconceivably in an abrupt & unsatisfactory way, something that is hard to account for given the massive length of a movie that unfortunately in every other respect never ceased to feel slow and lumbering.In this regard we get some major goodbyes at the end with respect to characters who in this film at least we have seen for a matter of seconds. Essentially making any sense of this requires us to reference the history of these films, something which is simply bad & indulgent writing.The massive assembly of characters, particularly at the end, is supposed to be one of the pulls of the film, but instead it serves to make their appearance superficial and works to diminish them as individuals. Just imagine meeting your favourite Marvel comic book hero in real life: well, by the end of this film that actually sounds like a rather dull prospect: the overblown nature of the wrap-up diminishes everyone. Bringing them all together simply works to cancel out teir uniqueness & makes their fantastic and in their own right typically overblown powers (Captain Marvel especially) seem prosaic in juxtaposition with each other.But a bit of indulgence could be forgiven if the story was worth anything much. Unfortunately compared to Infinity, there's really very little to it. The time travel aspect to it was too referential with respect to other movies (self-referentiality hasn't really worked well since the Scream movies). Sometimes with these types of movies you get fans duking it out on account of whether an idea is plausible or not. Maybe that has been happening but if so I'd be surprised; the narrative device never seems to be taken particularly seriously & for that reason it's difficult for the audience to take it very seriously: the time travel aspect is simply what needs to happen in order to sort the situation out & the writers simply come up with necessary justificiation & a few quips to let us know that they know we've seen it all before a hundred times.A part of the problem here is that the character motivations while there on paper never really felt that real. Renner's character was perhaps the most convincing in describing the bleakness of the post-Infinity world, but it never really seemed quite enough. Half the universe wiped out - something worse than the Black Death or Mongol destruction at its worth - but it never seems like that big a deal. A tighter script, maybe focussed more on an aggrieved Renner or equivalent might have made it seem real & genuinely high stakes.Beyond that there was very little in the movie that was simply enjoyable, in the switch off your mind & enjoy the ride variety. Thor has already been emasculated - he is simply a fat slob, & for reasons presumably relating to the next Thor film - he never recovers except to discover some meaningless cliche about being himself instead of who he should be. Nebula although good, has too much screen time. Downey's Iron Man is never his old self at any time. Peter Parker's ok but not present for much of the movie & superfluous to the plot. Captain Marvel is basically Superman but with unpleasant attitude instead of character & functions entirely as a deus ex machine - a narrative device pretty much synonymous with copping out & failing as a writer.The only two characters who have a likeable part in the film pretty much are Antman, who gets a surprisingly large part in this movie, & the Hulk, whose initial appearance as a composite of Bruce Banner & the Hulk himself is actually genuinly intriguing for a short time. Unfortunately even this latter innovation works to diminish the character in the final battle where we don't even have the pleasure of seeing the Hulk properly smash everything up.

"No one goes to see a comic book movie expecting to see an art house film. It happens sometimes but it is not the normal. What you expect to see is a fun movie with some philosophical concept and some emotional depth, comic books were never just about the action. So is this a great film? I don't care. Watching it I never stopped to think if there are plot holes or if the cinematography is good, I just enjoyed it. And enjoyed almost everything about it. The Russo brothers are not the new Goddard or the new Bergman (or even the new Spielberg) but they are talented and intellectual people, they had a goal and they delivered by not only doing fan service but also story service. The MCU has a great future.So, is it a great film? Comparing it with cinematic masterpieces I could give it a 6-7/10. Comparing it with other blockbuster movies I could give it a 12/10, it's that good...",positive
"The trailers to this film are completely misleading. It painted a bleak, inevitable outcome for the surviving heroes after Thanos's devastating snap that left the whole universe in ruins.It goes into a completely different direction than I originally expected. For one thing, it's much funnier than I thought.
It's also nothing like Infinity War. It's basically a mix of many other marvel movies all wrapped into one epic heist film.Its lengthy time run does get a bit problematic at times, but by the time the climactic battle sequence comes by the end, you forget all about it. Those who had been disappointed or despondent by Infinity War will rejoice when seeing this one.The film is a true testament to sacrifice, love and loss. Obviously I laughed, I cried and I clapped. This is truly cinematic history.",positive
"Despite what others may say or have said this film was far from predictable. I certainly lost my bets. I both laughed and cried during this film.
I loved every minute and none of those minutes were wasted. The writers outdid themselves on this one. I just hope the next ten years can live up to the first.
Here's hoping.",positive
"Amended after re-watching:
First the good:
1. Big fight scene was epic and was great to see everyone on screen at the same time . Amazing stuff.
2. Favorite part - Cap handles Thor's hammer. Just outstanding and emotional.
Ok, now the not so good:
1. Captain Marvel. Why they make the biggest and baddest superhero someone we haven't grown to love over the previous decade is baffling. And beyond that, Brie Larson is just unlikeable. But seriously, if she could take Thanos on head to head by herself and blow up his ship in seconds, why not let her wear the gauntlet? Lastly, going out of their way to let you know she's a lesbian was a bit much. You don't need a short haircut and ugly clothes just because you're gay. Plenty of attractive lesbians out there, but whatever. Brie butchers the role regardless.
2. Professor Hulk - did anyone like this adaptation? We've grown to love seeing Hulk smash and in both this and Infinity Wars, not one single fight scene with him smashing. Just sad.
3. Fat Thor - ok, fine, Chris Hemsworth can pull off the comedy really well, and I enjoy it when he does, but the whole movie we get the Big Lebowski? I would have much rather seen him back in shape magically from reconnecting with Mjolnir. In the end, he was still extremely awesome, so that was fine, but I just don't see the point of making him fat for the whole movie.
4. Time travel - is anyone besides me sick of every Sci-fi show using time travel to fix everything? If you're going to do it, at least take full advantage. We had the opportunity to see one on one fights with Thanos' Black Squad. How about Hulk going primal against the big guy (and even hurting Thanos some). Dr, Strange rematch with Ebony Maw, etc., etc. on the end, I think they could have cut some of the boring first hour and given us more action fight scenes that we've come to know Marvel for.In closing, the movie was still really good. I guess my expectations were just so high as they were closing out the phase that the changes with Hulk, Thor, and introduction of Captain Marvel just seemed misplaced and took away a lot of what I had come to love about the franchise. Still better than anything DC has managed to throw together.",positive
"Endgame has such a special place in my heart, it's so beautiful, but at the same time so painful to watch. The storyline is overall amazing and the characters is so amazing. Everything about this movie is incredible. This movie has it all , those cute comforting scenes, action scenes and fights, those scenes when you just can't stop crying it has it all. Endgame is such an experience. This movie is and I think will always be the turning point of marvel.",positive
I was slightly underwhelmed by the movie and I didn't cry at the ending at all. There was far too much sickly sweet scenes for my liking.The time travel bit left more questions than answers for me. The 2nd click mmmmI won't be going to see anymore Marvel movies apart from maybe Black Panther as I'm done,positive
"Just watch it by yourself. This movie has more deep story, and will mix all your feelings as well. Thanks god nowadays kid has a great role model for them and thanks god that i was born into this era when this Comic Book Movie exist.",positive
"I saw this with my entire family in a theater.
It was house full with too much clapping n whistling n some of the dialogues went bouncer. Will watch it again but I feel it is not on par with Infinity War.
In Infinity War, the war sequence n the fight scenes were all shot in broad daylight n that too in an open field of Wakanda without the fast paced camera tricks. It was visible who was fighting who but Endgame's war sequence is shot in the dark with too much fast paced camera tricks. At times it became hectic to make out who is fighting who.
The entry of Thor during the war in Infinity was epic but in Endgame it was duds.
The entry of Captain America with the background sound to save Vision in Infinity War was again epic but in Endgame it is not at all exciting.
Rocket's one liners were good though.",positive
"Three hours wasted, was about as good as declawing my dog and at least I like the dog. The storyline was terrible, and for many blatantly obvious reasons made no senses, to make matters worse it seemed to have more holes in it, than my old gym socks. Yes I know all the good guys weren't going to make it, everyone knew that, I actually hoped a few wouldn't make it, and that's not what I care about, this movie was rubbish it labored three hours to get to the point of dead good guys/bad guys then victory and bang happy ever after for two minutes then over. This is going straight in the never watch again list, unless trapped on a plane in which case fingers crossed for a parachute, but will jump without one.",negative
"My mom is very critical about movies she's not interested in most of them unless if one her favorite so called 'good looking' actors are in the film.
""I really really liked the movie, at first I thought 'oh god when is it gonna end so I can go to sleep' but I loved the movie and it was better than the previous one that you made me watch"" is the exact thing she told me so as you can see she's not a geeky die hard Avengers fan and we watched it at 1a.m. by the way and she really loves her sleep and the previous movie she was talking about was Infinity War.",positive
"Good story. Exciting battle. Marvel fans mustn't have been spoiled before watching this. But it may be not so friendly to newcomers. If the 181 minutes were full of excitements that would be definitely ok but actually there're a significant amount of quiet and peaceful moments, puzzling people who watch Marvel film for the first time. I don't know how would a Marvel fan judge them.",positive
"This film did nearly every Marvel/MCU fan justice. To see the epic conclusion of the Infinity Saga spanning for over 10 yearsThe film itself is great. The usual cast and crew teamed up to produce such an awesome film. The story could've maybe been more exciting during the middle. But that climax scene, wow! Definitely watch this film (but you need to watch every MCU film first)",positive
"What I like: it's a good ending. It's connected with the previous plot. It's about the past and the future, reality and memory, emotion and choice. What I don't like: there are too many boring slogans; there is too much discord in the existence of the surprise captain, and there is no such shock in the trailer.",positive
"A woman, who has lived and died in the flesh and blood of mortals, has never had a real family, never really been with someone she likes, and finally gave her life for the world. She died so far away, and there was not even a decent funeral after her death. Her friends almost didn't mention her after a short period of grief like no one else In the end, when someone is remembered all over the world, she almost seems to have never existed. Can it be worse?",positive
A breathtaking experience. Marvel played it's top trump card and blew alway any competition from start to finish. The battle scene is simply one of the if not greatest pieces of cinema ever. But it kept on giving after this. Anyone who gives this film less than a 10 is selling it extremely short.,positive
"I just want to say a few things:
Cap can suddenly hold and call Mjølnir, hammer of Thor??? Inconceivable!
Hulk is suddenly nice, clever and funny??
Captain Marvel could swipe clean the whole shebang, but not Thanos?
Cap suddenly decides to grow old and live an alternate timeline, without the rest?
Is there NO respect for the back-catalogue and the comics anymore?
And don't even get me started on the time-travel issue.
So disappointed.
No, no and no again, Marvel !!",positive
Avengers endgame is one of a kind well done Marvel studios,positive
Infinity War was way better. Endgame is super slow and even at times pretty boring. The third act somehow misses the mark and falls short of being the epic finale we've all been waiting for. Overall it was okay. It wasn't horrible. Definitely not the best either.,positive
"A fat Thor and a hippie dippy Hulk? Please. These moviemakers have very little loyalty to the original franchise, and no idea how to transform the persona of the original characters to the big screen. They basically bought the rights to a franchise and then formed the characters the way they wanted in order to tell a story they wanted to tell.Really enjoyed watching ""superheroes"" become mental cases and continually get their buts kicked in battle. How about making Thanos just a little more vulnerable and concluding everything with a good old battle to the end rather than introducing a bunch of sentimental goobly gop? It's a superhero movie for pete's sake!",negative
"Everybody, I mean everybody was in this movie. Endgame is basically an epic superhero movie. It will be interesting to see if they can ever top this on this kind of scale.I regret not seeing Avengers in the theater. This is the type of movie that needs to be watched on the big screen. I avoided it because I thought it was hype and only for the most diehard fans. However I think moviegoers who aren't really into this genre can appreciate Endgame.It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the hero's. The jokes were funny and it really felt like a family.The visuals looked amazing. From the spaceships to the planets the CGI was flawless. I loved it. It showed that the creators put their heart and soul into making this movie. Avengers Endgame is an absolute treat.",positive
"The only word I could muster after the screen cut to black was ""Unbelievable.""The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an achievement in film like we've never seen before, and Avengers: Endgame is the perfect culmination of this journey we have been on over the last decade. I genuinely cannot comprehend a more perfect way to end this story along with several character arcs.Endgame takes all of the best things from the previous 21 films and packs them seamlessly into the 3-hour runtime that still somehow leaves you wanting more.
All of the main characters give pinnacle performances here (one in particular, which you might have a guess but I will refrain from saying here).Hours later, I am still mostly speechless. Nothing else I can put into words will be able to do this film justice. You simply have to experience it for yourself.If you're a lifelong Marvel fan, you will swoon over this film. It will touch your heart. It will go down in history. Now stop what you're doing and go experience Avengers: Endgame.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is a well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It ties in many different storylines from previous films and allows you to reminisce while also saying goodbye to characters you've known and loved. This film has some flaws, of course, but it also made some bold choices and surprised me a number of times. I laughed. I cried. I loved this finale to the Infinity Saga.",positive
"Although throughout the movie you kinda expect what is happening, Avengers Endgame closes out the 10+ years of MCU greatly and opens up nicely new ways for future MCU films to come, it's definitely an unforgettable experience and a must watch for every MCU Fans, Non-MCU Fans might feel lost in this one.
10/10 for MCU Fans.
7/10 for Non-MCU Fans.",positive

"I remember when Superman died and how in the comic book world there was shock, dismay and great out cry necessitating him coming back. It served the purpose of hooking the audience and holding them captive. The same thing was applied to Spock dying in Star Trek again proving successful in generating fan response and revenue. Before Endgame came out and I only had the second movie to go by, I knew they all had to come back and I also knew that time travel played a part in it as there are only so many ways to come back. Sure enough, Endgame time-traveled and brought them back. The formula still works. Logically speaking, Disney didn't spend mutli-billions to kill everyone off however in the comic book world of which I keep reminding myself that anything is possible they can get away with these things. Knowing this before hand diminished my enjoyment of the Endgame but it wasn't limited to just that either. I am watching after everyone is brought back and they still couldn't defeat Thanos as a group or individually and that is without the stones mind you. With the stones they prevail making the stones more important than any Marvel character known. Before you vote on my sharing, be advised I have been reading comics for decades and was raised in that world and even collected them. I support and encourage the comic book world but would like them to keep it closer to reality than all-out fantasy suspension of major beliefs. One last thing. They keep using God as in OMG or other variations which totally contradicts the comic book world. That shouldn't be in the script for GOD is the ultimate super-hero and his comic would outsell everyones. Keep it real and I'll keep coming back.",positive
"Mild spoilers ahead.After a while watching ""Avengers: Endgame,"" the conclusion seems foregone and all notion of the unpredictable is lost. From the movie flatlines into a series of resolutions for characters I am not that invested in. I suppose the alternative wouldn't sit well with fans, but somehow the previous Avengers film ""Avengers: Infinity War"" seems like a huge feint. The characters reset to their previous lives (mostly), but without a huge sense of insight into dealing with the type of issues Thanos represented (overpopulation) going forward. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a disappointing non-answer to serious questions which had elevated ""Infinity War"" to something beyond a hero flick. But I don't see how the film's audience could've accepted a darker vision, and overall the writers did a good job with what they had, subverting some superhero tropes (hunky Thor got fat!) and answering some expectations for meaningful deaths. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is enjoyable Marvel fun but too conventional to be rewarding for film-goers wanting something important and lasting to be said. However it is a relief that some of the Marvel heroes have finally ended their franchise potential, and have done so at a good spot. Watch the film to find out who.",positive
"The almost 3 hours flew by with great writing and effects, and the change of the characters lives made it that much more entertaining - especially Thor! Better than I expected, and a wee bit better than the last film imo. 9/10",positive
"Let's face it, the movie is good and entertaining, well made with a few holes. Currently the score is that high ( more than 9) due to the hype, but the real score is around 7.I was expecting more dramatic ending and more deaths to be honest, but Marvel are too kind, so they would never do that.There were a few holes, like how the f did they discover the time travel within a few minutes? Something so complicated and impossible was discovered within a few minutes movie time. They should have spent more time on that.Thor was funny indeed but they really ruined the character, made him a monkey-like troll.A big ship was teleported and broke the entire building's ceiling , but nobody heard that? What?There are other details that were neglected, but I am not Rotten Tomatoe , I won't bash on the movie just because of a few things.As I said , the movie is well-made, good, entertaining, enjoy it.My score : 7/10",positive
The idea of the film is there. What killed the movie overall was the writing and the poor choices made by the director. I get that they wanted to pander to the younger kids that were 12 or younger but went to ridiculous lengths to do so that killed any reason for anyone over the age of 30 to like it beyond being happy that their children liked it.,negative
"Avengers: Endgame (SPOILER FREE) Review:After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe. Avengers: Endgame is literally one of, is not the, most anticipated film ever. This review is probably going to be shorter since its spoiler free and I have to be vague. I should have a spoiler review up soon (Monday is apparently the day we can talk about the spoilers according to the Russo Brothers). So this is a little late. I saw it last week Saturday and just saw it again last night. I wanted to see if it had the same effect as it did on first viewing. I'm pleased to say that I absolutely loved this film and even more than Infinity War. It's a great story that brings all 22 films in the Infinity Saga to a bittersweet end. The plot is much darker than any Marvel film. The first act was a drama where they're all realizing the events of what happened and it gets a good perspective for the audience. We saw in Infinity War that it affected the superheroes and some people but it makes us all think of the entire universe. It's tragic really. This is also when we get the most character development in any of the films. We see their true feelings. Now I could go on and on about how there wasn't a single bad performance by anyone, but I would like to talk about one. I'm currently on the petition that Robert Downey Jr. should get an Oscar nomination or at least a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. I believe this is his peak performance and he put all his emotions into it. The scenes at the beginning and end are his best though. Some brought me to tears. It's a very emotional film and I don't know how one could go in to it with at least tearing up. So Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, amazing job with the script. No line felt out of place. Everything came off natural. And also the Russo Brothers did their finest work directing and they're some of the best right now. There's so much to say about those but that's all I can say without giving it away. Now for the technical aspects. Alan Silvestri's score was interesting and beautiful because it had the original melodies like the previous Avengers films but this time he created new melodies that, for me at least, are just as memorable as the Avengers Theme. Also my favorite score of the year so far. The visual effects were good as usual and worked well with the chaos of the action, especially the final battle. Speaking of battles some say you could leave for the action since it's all the same and there was too much going on, but I strongly disagree. There is no time to get up and leave during this film. The cinematography was at its best of the franchise with Trent Opaloch as the cinematographer. And I think I'll leave my review at that. For more content I will have my spoiler review soon. I think this was an amazing film that brings the series all together. I'm pleased to say I liked it more than Infinity War and it's my favorite film of the year just beating Us. Therefore this is my first perfect film of the year. Please go see it if you haven't. I think this film is special and one you can never forget.My Grade: A+",positive
"Where ""Infinity War"" created havoc, ""Avengers: Endgame"" promised closure. The film is jam-packed with re-enactments of previous films' relationships. It practically requires that viewers do their homework by watching (or rewatching) a dozen previous films. The emphasis switches from lavish, effects-driven demonstrations of universe-saving heroism to the more personal cost of heroism. It establishes that whoever possesses the six all-powerful Infinity Stones may accomplish almost anything by just snapping their fingers. Because there is so much territory to cover in the film, it skips over introductions and presents Captain Marvel's entrance as a foregone conclusion.",positive
"A movie review must be without desire or force.
This is the first film of Avengers Saga in which I found about 10 mistakes and so I am disappointed and very dissatisfied.
1. ) What would happen if Winston Churchill or Hitler of 1930 come to 2019 and got killed by someone ? Certainly the past will be charged, but the movie says nothing will change.
What would happen if you go to the past of year 1930 and killed Hitler ? Of course the the past will be charged but the movie says nothing will change.
2.) Caption America is a man, then how could he able to successfully and permanently use the hammer -🔨 Mjolnir ?
3.) Do you know the name of the place which created the 🔨 Mjolnir or weapons of Asgardians ? How can Avengers's laboratory more capable than that place (Nidavellir). In the Endgame there was no harm to Infinity Gruntlet of Avengers even after 2 times use. But the Gruntlet of Infinity War movie, created at Nidavellir, was destroyed only after 1 time use.
4. ) How was it possible for Iron Man to hold and successfully use all the six Infinity Stones. He is simply a man or half robot.
5. ) In Endgame, Thor went to his past and got his hammer and returned to his future with that hammer. Then, what would happen with the Thor of the past ? Suppose we went to 6 August 1945 and returned to the future after stealing atomic bombs, then what would happen with Japan ? Suppose we went to 1940 and kidnapped Stalin and returned to the future with him. Then what would happen with WW2 and the USSR ?
6. ) A man can create more capable weapon than God ? A man can handle a powerful weapon of God ? We can change our past without changing our present or future ?Avengers Endgame is a highly exaggerated and superfluous movie trying to please and satiate 100 percent audiences.",positive
"A great ending, to a much loved saga. It would have been very easy for Marvel to mess this one up, but it delivered in all aspects.",positive
"It was a marvels fans dream. Loved it all the way. The perfect end to all the fans, giving moments of full action. Avengers: Endgame shows an incredible connection between all the movies of this amazing universe developed among eleven years.
Yes it slows down a bit. But over all a visual treat I must say.",positive
"Loved Endgame but with a lukewarm feeling for The Eternals and Shang Chi on the horizon, I wondered whether the MCU should make more logical choices for the next phase. Obviously there are development issues with the FF and X-Men franchises and DC's Aquaman may well scupper a potential Sub-Mariner movie, but perhaps these would work:1) Captain Britain (we heard 'Braddock' mentioned by Peggy Carter in Endgame; Brian's father perhaps?)
2) Alpha Flight. With the Avengers having run their course, perhaps their Canadian counterparts could step up. It stands to reason that other countries would want to copy the Avengers model (I know they are the Earth's protectors but they pretty much belong to the USA).
3) Moon Knight. Although I would love to see Daredevil done right on the big screen, maybe Marc Spector could fill the void.
4) Silver Surfer. Norrin Radd was the best thing about the FF sequel. A space-based movie would give him room to soar. Look to GotG or the Ron Lim Thanos issues of Silver Surfer for inspiration.
5) Ka-Zar. Although often perceived as a Tarzan rip-off, Lord Kevin Plunder's exploits could open up a whole new playground with the Savage Land.I wonder if we'll look back in 10 years and see if any of these came to pass...!",positive
"After all the hype, I expected to be extremely wowed. But I left feeling kind of meh. It was extremely long and dragged in several places. I felt like Infinity War was better overall. Good movie but seriously overhyped.",positive
This movie was awesome. It showed how much we need people who can inspire us and how to win battles. Congrats to all the people involved in the project and RIP Chadwick Boseman. I am shocked to hear that he is dead. I wish his family to be strong.,positive
"The Movie was more like an ""Infinity War Parody"" movie that the Epic Grand Final.Ok, there was an 8 minutes of action at the end, but nothing like the Plot or the action of Infinity War.There was almost nothing to remember from that movie, except the Black Widows death and the final battle while on ""Infinity War"" I can recall so many Epic Moments. There is no need for a second watch.-Thor and Hulk are more like a Parody than the smart fun quotes or people with psychological problems. Both was wasted in the movie.
They could give us some points using B.A.R.F. for Banners/Hulk problems.-Everything was so easy, 2024 Thanos killed just like that, and everything goes so easy.-So Captain America can have the Power of Old-fathers... Why is that? Ok he can hold Mjolnir but where did he find the Odin Force?-Tony Stark build the Time Machine so quickly and so easy, in just 10sec was render and done. And why? Because Ant-man says that he was 5 hours and for you 5 years. To good to be true, it needs more time just to be believed by the audience. It needs more reactions between Stark and Pym Particle and Ant-man to be more realistic.-Too much useless dialogs to put un in the emotional filings of the characters in the first 1,5 hour they could show are how Banner became Professor Hulk, or they can give more screen time in how Stark build the Time machine or the Stark gauntlet. Why Thanos use Uru metall while Stark just use Vibranium. At least they can use the Uru metall from the old destroyed Mjolnir in Norway.-So Thanos Blade can destroy Vibranium Shield (is his Blade from Uru? ) but If the Shield is broken how Older Captain America got his Shield back again in the End?
Lets say, Old Captain America is from an alternate timeline, so how he is in the same timeline with this one? Was there all the time hidden in all Marvel history?
Captain America was 100 but looks like 30, but he age up only 10 years in 70 years with the serum. So going back to '50s and life his life there now he must be 170, so he mush look like 40 years old, and not like 70 years old. (like Bucky, he didn't age at all, all this years). So Captain America live his life in '50s, '60s, '70s, etc till 2024 he show up with Vibranium Shield.
Where did he fund it? is it from an alternate timeline, and how ends up in that Timeline?-So Nebula from 2024 kills Nebula from 2014 but she doesn't get kill or disappear at all. So perhaps she is from an alternate timeline. But Old Captain American isn't from alternate timeline but his Shield is from alternate timeline. Also, every character that enters the Quantum realm should be an alternate timeline of him self... but they aren't.
So why there is alternate timeline in some characters and alternate timeline in some others. Thats Bad script with lot of Plot Holes.-During the movie lots of the times there was a change in history, but the movie didn't show a clue about them. But still they show to us Older Captain America waiting for them near the lake.-There was no surprise in anything, or nothing Epic at all. Nothing memorial. Just and alternate timeline white-out being into the plot of the other movies.
it would be nice if there was a script that will embed all the timeline of the MCU movies and revail how some things really happent.
They just wrote a script and mess up everything with out count on it, just to have another movie.-So, they broke up all the containers of the Infinity stones... How they are going to take them back ? How they will take Space stone back to '50s without the container?
And if it is an alternate timeline, why they should take them back anyway? Who cares about the alternate timeline... certainly not the Script writers of the movie.-So the Mind stone and the Soul Stones stays on 2024, all others goes back to the past. The Space Stone end up to an alternate timeline to Locki. But Thanos never collect the rest of them so Aether is still with the collector and time stone with Strange. Zandar got the Powerstone.
But still none of them change anything in the timeline but is should... just like Old Captain America was there in 2024.
-The big fight in the end was a big mess. There was two big Ant-mans.
When Thanos Spaceship brake down by C.Marvel it destroys all the Water barrier so everyone should be drawn (Strange block up just a small one before that).-So, if Stark gauntlet is part of Stark Armor and made with Friday AI, Why just don't Friday disassemble the gauntlet and fly away when Thanos wears it?
Anyway, there are so many that I can write. hope in the future Marvel will make a Real Timetravel Movie. That wasn't so real, just an alternate timeline timetravel movie with only Old Captain America as 'Timetravel Paradox'.",positive
"What a crying shame that a movie that had so many people awaiting its arrival delivered so little. And, it seemed to take forever to deliver that!I believe that this is one of the most critical reviews I have ever given and believe me, I firmly believe that it is wholly because my expectations were set so high by the franchise that it was pretty much doomed unless it was mind blowingly good.If the story had had one thread of; 'that was believable' or even an odd; 'that could work' it may have been able to recover but, it doesn't. It doesn't even have a; 'that was cool' at any point either!It's actually so boring I had finally found a movie I could replenish concessions during and didn't feel like I had missed anything. The reality is that I probably missed some really critical parts but it didn't matter, the movie had lost me long since then.The entire story was so convoluted that it was just plain terrible. The basic thread was non existent and I agree with many other reviewers that certain characters were pointless.Synopsis: Infinity wars was mediocre, this isn't. Also, personally, it has done so much harm to the franchise, I for one won't be bothering to spend the 'sizeable' costs involved in cinema excursions for any Avenger related future offering again.",negative
"The Russo brothers took what was seemingly a impossible task of not only meeting expectations but of wrapping up a storyline 11 years in the making and they knocked it out of the park.To take all these characters, their storylines, their archs, and bring it all together to fit in one single film and for everyone to have their moments is what I can only imagine to be an extremely difficult task yet the cast and crew made it look easy. While I would've wished for more screen time from certain characters ie Ronan it was still well done.Now there's obviously no such thing as the perfect film but this comes damn close. An amazing cast, fantastic visuals, phenomenal score by Alan Silvestri, and something Marvel lacks today good writing.This was the film of a generation and the theater going experience of a lifetime, I would just like to say thank you to the Russo brothers and the entirety of the cast and crew for the hard work and passion that went into the making of this phenomenal film...

"I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even ""copied"" or ""homaged"" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?Yes the first hour of the movie is ""slow"", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of courseEdit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is ""technically sound"" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway. Popcorn (or Nachos or whatever you prefer) to perfection",positive
"AND THE WAIT IS OVERInfinity War which gave the world rumbling because of the wrath of Thanos. And here it elevates the emotions of every MCU fans that too right from the stone.I always wanted to brag/say about Endgame but that will end up with too many spoilers. So the plot remains unrevealed.The movie has an ensemble cast feat. all the ones you've known and with the outnumbered super heroes teams up to defeat Thanos, one of the most powerful villain of MCU. He stands out tall in this one too. All superheroes has their own spaces, imprinting themselves in everyone's mind. Endgame portrays the emotions and personal stories of the superheroes and was really touching.Even though Endgame is Visual Masterpiece but rides through the emotions whole throughout but also will make you laugh. Thor, Antman, Hulk and Rocket leads the laughter squad. Captain America was not my fav. hero, but after this he has a special spot in my heart. Iron Man, he was brilliant. All the superheroes will grab a special place in your heart for sure.Russo brothers did a wonderful job in terms of writing and in directing. Endgame is visual treat to the eyes and the finale battle was also well convincing. Technical aspects were outstanding in terms of Camera, Score, CGI, Editing, Art, etc.It's a long 181 minutes movie but you will not take your eyes even for one second.A must watch in Theaters especially in IMAX. a MASTERPIECEI will go out with 10 on 10",positive
"It was just amazing! Incredible, epic, emotional, action-packed and awesome! I wonder how it will all go on after this... Not since the wnd of Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings have I been so excited for an ending saga. I can't wait for what is next. An all female Avengers? Hopefully!",positive
"After seeing Infinity War i was so excited to see this movie. I must say i was rather disappointed. This movie was not awful, there are some really good scenes but there were so many things that annoyed me.
Thor - he was literally turned into a joke. Ruined his entire character and back story,.
Hulk - did he actually do anything? No! absolutely ruined his character. After being useless in the last movie i honestly thought he would redeem himself in this one. It does not happen.
Captain Marvel - Why create such a powerful character then miss her out of 90% of the movie? When she does finally appear i was expecting an epic fight scene between her and Thanos...... no! nothing. They literally have a little scuffle and that's the end of it. Then you don't see her again until the very end of the movie.
The time travel story made no sense - i can't even begin to type about that.you'll see if/when you watch. I will just say this - The Thanos the Avengers were fighting was based before all of the Avengers movies - which means after killing him, the first movies would never have happened. thats just one.
The first half of the movie was a little slow paced, i was thinking ""is something going to happen"". The end battle was good but it was WAY too short and there was so much going on that I couldn't concentrate on one thing. Plus i do not understand how Thanos was so powerful without the infinity stones.
The weapon Thor created in Infinity war was capable of killing Thanos but, for some reason Thor couldn't defeat him with not one, but 2 weapons. Speaking of weapons, I hated the fact that Captain America was able/worthy of wielding Thor's hammer - NO! its Thor's weapon. I felt like it took power away from the characters.
Like i said - not awful, but nowhere near as good as Infinity War (which i would rate a 9). I rated this movie a 6 because that's an average rating, and i think this movie is average.",positive
Absolutely strange how they could cut so strong first part of Avengers and spoil the second one! All dialogues are weak and absurd same as a few plot lines. The last 5 minutes of the film is all-around failure!,positive
"Infinity war was a tough act to follow; ultimately nothing was likely to be sufficient as a closing act.
Disregarding plot holes, which don't really matter to much in an action film, there are a few aspects which brought the film low.The movie is very self-indulgent with fan service. A little is fine, but it's a massive component in this movie.There's Ragnarok-level humour, which will undoubtedly be to the tastes of many - just not mine.The film is very slow to get off the ground. That's fine as long as there is some real substance, but it's lacking.Characters have been handicapped in order to curb the power creep, where as others are momentarily escalated in ability. This is not uncommon, but very noticeable in this flick due to the volume.Of course, you're going to see it regardless; don't go in sky-high expectations and you'll probably have a good time.",positive
"If you like special effects then you will like this movie. If you like a good, intriguing, believable story with interesting characters then this movie may be very lacking in that department. The characters with all their interesting super powers just seemed to be a bore. Perhaps this sort of thing happens when you have too many main characters in one movie. There is no character development. One thing there is no shortage of is good looking special effects but it merely covers up the inadequacy of any kind of substance in the story lines and characters.The story totally contradicts itself. I'm not going to post spoilers in this review but in the end it really looked like the writers just made up unrealistic stuff that did not make any sense or had any sort of believable realism. If you tell a story like a 3 year old, other 3 year olds are going to love your story but adults are going to be bored to tears.They turned almighty Thor into a 3 year old, with mannerisms, intellect and all the traits 3 year olds display. But here we go again with Hollywood trying to emasculate men in all their latest block busters. Political nonsense that seems to be infecting and infesting big budget movies... It really just makes the world of Hollywood look all the more plastic.Perhaps the extremely high rating of this movie made me expect something really good and entertaining but all the enthusiasm I had soon turned in boredom and mild resentment because 3 hours is a lot to spend on something that seemed to bring only boredom.",negative
"This movie isn't perfect. But i feel like Endgame is actually pretty amazing because it has more characters than any other movie and somehow manages to give a conclusive ending to all of them along with 11 years of the Infinity saga. Ngl, My life was complete when I saw the Portals scene.",positive
"Breathtaking. Endgame raises the bar so high. The emotion, comedy and action all combined to produce a movie of epic proportions that probably won't be matched for many years to come! The best MCU movie. Easily one of my all time Top 5 favs.",positive
"I think that this might be even better than infinity war, everyone gets a moment to shine, the ending is spectacular and it might be one of the best films in the Marvel cinematic universe (can't beat guardians of the galaxy though).",positive
"First of all I gave this movie a 10 because I want to hype it a bit because it still should serve as a very good example for any superhero movie or blockbuster in general. But if I was honest with myself I would give it an 8.Let me explain why and before we proceed here comes the necessary
SPOILER ALERT!!So why did Endgame leave me with a bittersweet taste?
First, because I loved Infinity war very very much. What I loved then was the fact that the story wasn't the usual Manichean hero story with a fight between good and evil. I read the message of Infinity war as an understanding of morality being more subjective than absolute. And I believe that our concepts or ethics and morality in the modern society are often biased and uneducated because we refuse to see what lies beyond the scope of our little self-centered lives.Wherever you root for Thanos or not, believes he is a horrendous monster or a misunderstood hero doesn't matter in the end. But I believe a story must be honest to its core and should be an opportunity to show us what we don't want to see. A truth that is not as radical as what our reason can bear.And in that sense, Infinity war did a great job by giving an honest ending. Every character has lost the people they loved, even Thanos. But we had the sense that despite this horrible event, the future of the universe was still hopeful like Thanos predicted.And that's where Endgame faulted primarily in my opinion. They depict the 5 years later on Earth like a depressed desolated world. And I strongly believed that this is an utterly dishonest and unrealistic version of what it would be. If 50% of the human race would be wiped out in the real world. Of course we would be shocked, traumatized. There would be grief, there would be despair. But whether you like it or not, it is something most people would be able to overcome. And especially after 5 years, humanity would definitely have been able to move on. A lot of people would have been able to support each other because many would share the same grief. Then some people would even have thrived and find opportunity in this chaotic situation turning things around and finding ways to make their country or their world great again. I'm sorry for being cynical but if some people would lose loved ones, some would likely also loose enemies or people who used to be a burden or a competition.In the end, the survival instinct and/or pursuit of happiness are strong motivators and would definitely prevail at least for a lot of people or at least for enough people so that these ones start inspiring the others. And yeah I think 5 years is enough time to see the ""benefits"" of this massive shared drama.So if Endgame had been honest with this context and had put its characters in a new prosperous world, we could have seen some heroes being even more conflicted. The avengers would have had a harder time moving on than anybody else because they lost. It was their role, their responsibility to protect mankind and they failed. But by seeing that the world is a happier place, that the other people moved on with their lives and that a lot of problems like climate change and such have recessed, it would be harder for them to act when they hear the eventuality of a solution to fix what happened. Like we see with Tony Stark, who has his family, his daughter and a happy quiet life.I believe it was a missed opportunity to not use this extremely logic yet clever conflict between being human and being a hero and use it more throughout the story.And also not completely demonizing Thanos who was a more layered and complex character in Infinity war.But yeah especially for Iron man/Tony Stark, if we had seen him struggling more, being more in conflict of doing the hard choice, hesitating being a hero or being a dad, and if the consequences of Thanos's snap wasn't shown just as gloomy and dark but if there was actually a bit of silver lining to it, that maybe he wasn't completely wrong about the balancing of the universe, I think it would have been even more interesting.I believe that the more human a hero is, the harder it is to act heroically for him, the more his heroic action will transcend.For me Endgame succeeded at 60% to achieve the climax I was hoping which is why I had this bittersweet feeling at the end.Still is a great movie. So I'm sure I will appreciate it more and more as I leave my expectations behind.PS: There were some great performances from the cast especially when they were playing with non-big professional actors, like the girl playing Morgan or the kids asking for a selfie at the diner, or with the director Joe Russo at the meeting. It felt casual and natural in a very good way. That was brilliant.",positive
"The heroes leaving it out all there and sacrificing their lives in the end really speaks to the soul. Black widow fighting to sacrifice herself was so sad and beautiful at the same time. I cried when Iron Man finally let go. Gwyneth Paltrow absolutely crushed it in that scene, her telling him that they're gonna be ok and he can let go...😭. Gut-wrenching! Emotional scenes all over; Captain America seeing his love for the first time in ages throw the window with the blinds, that was great stuff. Iron Man's relationship with his daughter...just all kinds of really awesome moments. Heroes were brave and sacrificial, they showed true love and it was awesome. There were a couple liberal-ish, pseudophilosophical bits here and there. ""Don't be who you're supposed to be, be who you are."" Sounds like irresponsible rubbish to me. The redefining of what a hero by Thor's Mom made no sense, but it was brief and negligible. And the little moment where all the girls get together to fight was patronizing in my opinion.
Yes, some of the writing was cheesy. It wasn't as bad as some are complaining about. The 3 hours didn't feel bad to me. The movie kept moving along and kept me engaged and interested. Anyone who gets that bent out of shape about the time travel stuff needs to just stop watching movies. If you can't suspend your belief at all you can't enjoy a movie. Captain America being able to wield Thor's hammer was cool but I have no idea where that came from. But I also didn't really care at that point. It didn't offend me and it was fun and it didn't take away from anything good in the fim. The score was good, visuals were 10/10 of course. The final battle scene was the best large battle on screen since LOTR battles. It was really good, I am looking forward to watching it again sometime!",positive
"The hardest thing to do is end something. The ending of a story, novel, or movie is probably the hardest thing to write. This is not the climax and falling action, but the resolution, where all the dangling threads are tied up and resolved. Very few writers can create one with supreme satisfaction - mostly because in this day and age writers want sequels and franchises. Avengers Endgame is the pinnacle of Marvel movies. It is a masterpiece of the super-hero genre. It gives closure, and resolution.
The movie picks up almost immediately after Thanos snapped half the world out of existence. The remaining Avengers, Iron Man (Tony Stark), War Machine (Don Cheedle), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) are trying to gather their wits after they had their asses handed to them.
Tony is on his way back to Earth from Titan. His only companion is Nebula (Karen Gillian). Fortunately, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) comes to the rescue. Bringing them back to Earth, they are reunited ... for a moment. Tony wants nothing to do with them after Cap's betrayal. He goes back to Pepper.
The remaining heroes track down Thanos (Josh Brolin) and find the Infinity Stones have destroyed themselves, as well as him. Now, what do we do?
Five years later, a van in San Francisco has its computer activated by a mouse. It activates the shrinking device that left Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) stranded in the shrunken universe. He comes back - but the five year isolation was only five hours to the Ant Man. He traverses the nation to find the Avengers. When he learns of what happened, he has an idea. The microscopic universe has entry and exit points in time.
Yes, they can travel back in time and find the Infinity Stones, bring them back, and snap everyone back into existence. Hey, you have to realize that time travel was going to come into this sooner or later. The Avengers need Tony to figure out a way to take out the random effects, but he is tied too much to Pepper (Gwenyth Paltrow), and their daughter, Morgan.
Tony, though, cannot back out of a possibility of setting things right. He is onboard with the idea, so three teams travel back to different points. Tony, Bruce, Steve, and Scott (hey, my name's Steve Scott!) head to New York after the Avengers battle. Roadie, Nebula, Nadia, and Clint (Jeremy Renner) return to the stellar world where two other stones exist. Rocket and Thor return to Asgaarrd before its destruction to fetch a couple of others.
As they find the stones, they find themselves - as well as a slew of MCU characters that helped and hindered them on the way. Loki, Brumlow, Sitwell, Pierce (Robert Redford) all have their cameos as former HYDRA secret operatives. Of course, it would be a sin not to have Tom Hiddleston return as Loki. Tony and Steve go to another spot where Steve catches a glimpse of Peggy Carter (Haylee Atwell), and Tony gets to have some words with his father, Howard Stark (John Slattery).
Thor gets to see Jane again (Natalie Portman), as well as his mother, Frigga (Rene Russo). Rocket has to work hard and convince him to take the stones back. Of course, Thor cannot leave without one particular thing.
Meanwhile, Clint and Nadia have to retrieve the Soul Stone. They need a soul to get it. At the same time, Thanos, who is alive at this point, realizes the Nebula of the past is having glitches. He and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) are able to figure out what they are doing there. Realizing their plan, he has to stop them and make sure his plan comes through.
You can tell this all-star cast was handled well, providing story, action, laughs, and even tears. A few of these heroes sacrifice themselves for others. They get to reconcile themselves over past mistakes, regrets, and get to redeem themselves. They are reunited with loves ones lost five years ago when Thanos snapped his fingers. And they fight together against a foe for the first time since Avengers Age of Ultron. They were one team.
Someone could easily nit-pick this one, especially on the time travel. However, the ending brings so much satisfaction. Between the sacrifices, the second chances, the characters all have their resolutions tied up, with no post-credit scenes. Some of the character arcs are messy, but the movie provides an emotional satisfaction unheralded in motion picture history. Avengers Endgame gets a perfect score.",positive
"After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story.
I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War.
I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story.
There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others.
The story is average at best with big flaws.",positive
Avengers endgame might be long but it feels like the fastest 3 hour movie I've seen. Everything works even with the few plot holes. The action is evenly paced and works where they put it and all leads up to the greatest climatic battle scene in a long long time.,positive
"Honestly: at the 2 hour mark i was checking my watch to try and figure out how much more I had to put up with before it made sense.
The storyline was sporadic, and bounced around so much that it just got confusing and boring.
I have no intent, nor interest, to watch it again",positive
"I had no choice but to watch it to finish the sequence. The worst of all the Avengers movies. Apart from some action scenes all the rest it is pure lame dialogues and poor performances.
Purely made to make money out of a ""trendy"" public that are rating this movie high because I've never met one single person who has read the comics and like this garbage.
At least, there will be no more of this, I hope.",negative
"This movie is everything that fans and viewers wanted it to be. It clearly shows that the makers have put their heart and soul into the movie instead of just making money out of the popularity.It is 3 hours long but never felt like it. The sequence of emotions in the movie is sad, cheer, laugh, cry and repeat.Watch it before it gets spoiled for you!!!",positive
"It's going to be very difficult to top this, and it's also very difficult to express how amazing this film is without spoilers, so I will just keep it brief and say that you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't see this film. It is an epic event in every sense of the word, and you will never forget seeing this movie. The last hout will never leave your memory as long as you live. It is the epitome of action sacrifice and heroism and encapsulates the never ending battle of good versus evil. Go see this movie. See it twice.",positive
"Wow. This film will have you going through every emotion imaginable.
If you have followed every Marvel movie in sequence leading up to this conclusion, you will soon be left feeling like you have lost a family member. An amazing end to this Marvel chapter.",positive
"After 21 films worth of waiting, Marvel has finally reached the conclusion to the Infinity Saga in Avengers: Endgame. The collective movies had mad billions of dollars, and captured the hearts of comic book fans around the world. The prior entry, Avengers: Infinity War added a certain sense of gravitas and catharsis to the Marvel Universe. The prior film left fans not only devastated, but with more questions than answers with it's cliffhanger, serial ending. So how does the conclusion fare? Are the Fallen avenged? Is Endgame worth the hype?One of my greatest praises of Shazam! was the amount of personal consequence it had. One of my biggest criticisms of most superhero movies is that the consequence is constantly about saving the world. This then makes saving the world a redundant outcome that we know the superheroes will eventually solve. With constant resurrections and story revisions, the Marvel Universe greatly lacked this. Yet even though the world saving was still the primary conflict of Endgame, the story contained personal consequence for each individual character that made the film far more endearing to the viewer. This filled the film with incredibly written, visceral moments of joy, pain, and everything in between.The amount of story-boarding that went into the film is insane. The run time is long, but a necessary evil to the human bladder to tie up so many loose ends within an incredibly convoluted plot. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has so many characters, and Endgame gives resolution to their individual strife, while raising questions that can be pursued in future films. It gives each character their own space in the spotlight while concurrently sharing it equally. It is absolute brilliant direction by the Russo brothers.I cannot justifiably call Endgame the singular greatest superhero film of all time. Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy is still brilliant, and did not need 21 films of buildup. Yet it absolutely rivals the trilogy with the first Marvel film that takes a chance with the ultimate pathos. The film rewards the fans who have seen all of the films, even the poorer entries, while inviting new fans with instant accessibility. I never checked my watch, I never felt the need to get up from my seat, which is something that has never occurred for me within a three hour movie. Not every direction choice worked as intended, not every story point was logistically flawless, but it still works. I laughed, I cried, and sometimes even did bof. Not both, but BOF. I can't give Avengers:Endgame any grade worse than perfect.(Grade: 10/10)",positive
"I cant say I was disappointed in Endgame as a whole, they wrapped up this phase in the franchise pretty well.Parts did drag on longer than needed, other parts rushed that could have used more time. But that's ok I can deal with that.Endgame was not as good as Infinity War in my opinion, IW had much better pacing and dialogue than EG and the story was much better.Stuff I liked:Tony Stark/Steve Rodgers dialogue. Any time those two are on screen together it just flat out works. They could talk about dinner reservations and I'd be engrossed in that conversation..Lewboski reference. Loved it..Hawkeye/Black Widow going after the Soul Stone. You knew one of them was going to have to die to get it but intense and a surprise all the way through. Well done.Soundtrack. Dear Mr. Fantasy a fav of mine and to hear that open made my night.How they brought back Gamora. Nice twist didn't see that coming. And the ""real"" Nebula working on her to win her over.Starks death, Rodger's ending. Both perfect and worked. Glad he got his dance and a real lifeFew things I didn't care for.Wanted more Rocket interaction with the other Avengers. Expected more Rocket/Tony Stark back and forth in witty dialogue. Would have been epic.Captain Marvel. Over powered and didn't earn it. Hoped for better than he solo movie and it never happened.Time Travel. I figured the quantum realm would come into play to reverse things, but Stark figuring out time travel in general was a little much. I think with some creative writing they could have skipped all that time travel discovery stuff and just used the quantum realm angle to fix things and bring people back.Not enough Thanos. Even with Thanos coming back into play, not enough screen time. He's way to great a character and needed much more attention. In EG he didn't have as great the dialogue as IW gave him and even less depth than in IW. Jim Starlin's creation deserved better.The whole Battle of the Five Armies Hobbit ending... Would have been more intense with just Thanos and his Black Order - they could have held their own against all the Avengers new and oldAs a whole though I got to admit I walked away satisfied. We always want more and/or expect different or better, but this is what we got.I can live with it and be happy. Thank you Marvel Studios",positive
"I love this movie but not everything is fully explained. My biggest question: None of the Avengers knew Nebula was Thanos' daughter or they didn't worry about her loyalty? I would wonder about her loyalty. After being forced to be confronted by Thanos during the search, Nebula feels forced to help him and his army enter earth. Nebula opens the time portal while Hulk snaps his fingers with all five gems to restore human lives on earth but no one questions what caused the war on earth? I love the scene during the battle when Captain Marvel returns and helps defeat Thanos. There have been so many movies involving The Avengers but all of the overlapping tends to be confusing. Speaking of which, I am still confused with the scenes involving Nebula and Gamora from the past with Nebula from the present.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame forgot that it was just a superhero, and suffered from trying to be far too ""epic"". Along the way, it lost the brisk pace and light humor that brightened up the first two movies of the series, as it tried to do too much, with too many characters, over too many needless scenes. The whole thing felt overly drawn out. 30 minutes of this film could easily have found it's way onto the cutting room floor, and the movie would have been stronger for it.In many ways, it was like the writer's of this installment lost their touch. The fat Thor joke was funny for the first 5 minutes, but they kept coming back to it again and again and again. Ya, ya, we know he got fat and lazy. Ha, ha. Now move on! But at least the overweight, drunken Thor gave us something to chuckle about, as there was very little else of a lighter, funny nature in this over-serious marathon of a movie.There was also far too much posing. A good example of this was during the huge final battle, with the fate of the world, nay the entire galaxy, hanging in the balance .... and all the female superheroes found the time to line up for a photo op! What was that all about? From across a battlefield that stretched over seemingly several square miles, all the female superheroes left whatever they were doing, in order to travel clear to where all the other female superheroes were, so that they could stand shoulder to shoulder and go ""Ok, girls, now that we're all here, lets look really serious and determined for the camera! Now, Charge!Ya, way overdone and unnecessary.As was the final funeral for .... SPOILER ALERT!! .... Ironman. I mean, come on. All that was needed was a nicely written 5 minute scene around his grave, or perhaps a memorial. What the movie didn't need was a 20 minute movie within a movie, tagged on to the end of what was already a very long film.But that was the story of this movie. Many scenes seemed overplayed and overwritten, and just a shade too long. I still enjoyed the movie, and still gave it a 7, but it could have been so much better if it had just relaxed and been more like the movies that had gotten us here. It simply tried too hard to be the greatest superhero movie of all time, and as a result, fell far short.",positive
"This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it's still up there for one of their stronger movies. It's not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.
TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie",positive
"******SPOILER ALERT******I have been eagerly waiting for this movie since the end of IW a year ago. For the most part, I was suitably entertained; however, I could not ignore the glaring plotholes throughout the movie - especially because time-traveling was involved. These are my biggest quibbles, and I will likely have more when I see it again this Sunday:1) The mass ""vanishing"" was completely glossed over. You would think that half of Earth's population suddenly disappearing would cause massive chaos, especially considering that heads of states and other government officials were probably snapped out of existence as well. Other than the memorials of the vanished and mounds of garbage in one neighborhood (nobody bothered to clean it up in five years?), you really don't get a complete sense of the state of world post-snap.2) Remember ""The Butterfly Affect""? One thing changes everything? How did the theft of the Infinity Stones during multiple time periods NOT completely screw up the current timeline (which was likely set around the year 2021 or 2022)? Not only that, Loki escaped with the Tesseract in 2012. Thor stole Mjolnir from his 2013 counterpart in Asgard. Those two events should have also led to major reprecussions to the current timeline, but nope.3) Bruce snapping everyone BACK into existence was also glossed over. Other than the vanished heroes making a dramatic appearance in the final battle, none of the implications of the sudden reappearance of billions of people were addressed. For example, what happened to the ""vanished"" people who happened to be flying in an airplane at the time of their disappearance? Did they reappear in the air - only to plummet thousands of feet to their deaths?4) Steve Rogers staying in the past to marry his old flame should have changed EVERYTHING. I'll leave it at that.5) How is current day Nebula still alive after killing her 2014 counterpart? And is 2014 Gamora now stuck in the current timeline?6) How was 2014 Nebula able to get Thanos' ship and his ENTIRE ARMY through the Quantum Realm?7) And where did Valkyrie get her winged horse?!Other quibbles: The movie was WAY too long and completely dragged for about a good hour or so. Captain Marvel was primarily used as a deus ex machina. Space is BIG - how the heck did she find Tony Stark and Nebula drifting through space? She went missing for a good couple hours (although she stayed around long enough for Rocket to make a wisecrack about her hair), and showed up in the big battle at the last second to blow stuff up and throw a couple good punches at Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, should he have been much weaker without the Infinity Stones? Somehow, he was able to go toe-to-toe with both Thor and Captain Marvel; both who should have been able to mop the floor with him by themselves.Overall, it is a good comic book movie, but definitely not the best MCU movie. That honor still belongs to Infinity War, with Thor: Ragnorak being a close second.",positive
"There's absolutely no pay off to be had plot wise here. Nothing to see here people. Fast forward through to the last hour and you're good. You will have missed nothing.This movie was either way too long or just nowhere near long enough. This was supposed to be a part II of conclusion that wraps up an entire universe of characters spanning 20 movies and they couldn't be arsed to give us a third act?Unfortunately, they titled the movie Avengers: Endgame, and making a sequel to that would be nearly as bad as having a movie titled Rambo: First Blood Part II. What would they have called a third movie? Avengers: The Really Real End Time, Place, Realm. (No, we honestly mean it this time.)Sadly, the first hour or so of the movie is Ant Man trying to save a tacked on, marketing driven first act that pays off in no way. Meanwhile, also tied to marketing, some major plot holes and omissions were completely egregious.A large portion of the principle photography for this movie was done alongside side Infinity Wars itself, which would've made sense if they'd had a coherent story line by then.Leave it to the screenwriters, they'll make something of it. Leave it to the editors, they'll fix it in post. Well, somebody forgot to fix it. And it wasn't me. Fortunately, marketing fixes everything.Let's face it, there are two kinds of people in this world: those who for a final movie who are just going to love it no matter what, those who view the movie with the same critical eye they would the others, and those who decide that there can only be two types of people.Why are there always two kinds of people? Look at Loki! Now that's an interesting character. He can be good; he can be bad. He's fiendish and lovable. He's a hero and a villain and an anti-hero and-still, somehow-human, god, and ice thing.Honestly, Infinity Wars couldn't have come at a worse time. It was originally a much larger unification of Marvel heroes and villains, and now that Disney owns all of the other Marvel Universe crap, that movie could've been the Infinity Wars, with a plot that started to wrap up before the last movie.Ah well, maybe in 20 years they'll redo the whole thing again with the X-Men and Silver Surfer in it (take or leave the Fan-4. This is super likely.I heard Spider Man: Far From Home was really really good, but I have no desire to see it. Why? Because it sounds to me like Spider Man visits France for Holiday and Meets some Good Guys and some Bad Guys and forces you to watch the credits so you can see 30 seconds that tease you into watching the next movie that's just going to do the same thing.",negative
"Avengers: Endgame is literally everything you have wanted AND MORE in a Marvel movie.
I'm not going to lie, it is slow to get into at the start, but the last hour is the reason I HAD TO give this film a 10/10.
Honestly, as everyone has mentioned, it's a culmination of everything good in Marvel. It's beauty, perfection and whatever else you can think of.
Endgame lived up to its hype and certain characters truly ended in such an amazing way.
You'll never expect ANYTHING.
No joke, I am going to have to go watch this again!!
3000% recommended ;-)",positive
"I saw Avengers Endgame and it was incredible I absolutely loved it. The only blemish on this otherwise perfect movie is Captian Marvel she is the most *obnoxious* characters I have ever seen in my entire life. Annoying, Stone cold, smug, unsimpathic, ridiculously overpowered when Thanos punches he she just takes it WHAT THE ACTUAL H**L. All the other characters can barely land a punch. She flies through Thanos' ship like it is cardboard. She is a very unnecessary charcater. What bugged me the most is that when all the other Avengers were depressed even poor Thor was trying to drink his troubles away. Then this sarcastic a**hole comes in completely insensitive to them. What is wrong with you! Horrible Horrible Charcater. It reminds me of the Spongebob episode *Artist Unknown*. Squidward was the art teacher. Spongebob came in and was perfect at everything while barely trying. Only that was annoying for comedy purposes this is annoying for bad writting purposes.",positive
"In these films the desire and there work rate is fantastic, they do so well together and do well as a team. It is fun to watch them that way. It was a bit boring at times though but still very enjoyable to watch. I can't believe Iron-man has died he was so cool and did very well in his own films. Robert Downey Jr as Iron-Man did so well. And watching the fight at the end was so fun and good to watch. It is good to see that Marvel make good progress as they go along, well most of the time anyway. It is good to also see TOM HOLLAND in the film right at the end to because it gives him a chance as well as the others. He did really well as well like he always dose. And it was funny that Hulk got to have a picture with the kids and Ant-man offers and doesn't get to have a photo. It is also my favorite Marvel movie, like I said because the togetherness is so good to see. It was a good ending to, to see that it had most of the characters on their or at least the main ones. It was also funny at times as well, especially the time machine bit. They needed also to do a quest and they went back in time with the time machine that they had, it was because they needed to get the infinity stones so that Thanos could not get them. It was also a quit intense movie at times as well.",positive

"There have been few movies in history that created this kind of hype - a sociological and emotional mass hysteria that covered the globe. An expectation that surpassed all others, an ending that everyone was expecting yet caught everyone by surprise, shock and awe. Endgame had a lot of expectations to fulfill, and it surpassed them all... light years from what was expected.Never has a year passed so quickly and with so much hype. The end days before the premiere were filled with nothing but expectation, fingernail biting and prolonged stages of sleep deprivation and theory development. If one was being scrubbed by one's boss - it didn't matter - Endgame is in a couple of days... if one was ill, one got better on the day of the premiere. Endgame had an effect that was so much more than a movie. It was an event of a generation, an ending to a decade long story and the finalization of all the character's arks. And yet, it had to be a sequel worthy of Infinity war. How was this possible to achieve all that in a single movie?1) The story. Unlike Infinity war which was much more a character driven movie (especially Thanos and the gang on Titan) Endgame is a story driven movie. The entire movie is split in three segments: a) the beginning; b) the middle; c) the endgame. The beginning is a bit rushed, uneasy on the casual viewer, expecting too much from the audience to follow in one moment. But then, it slows down, takes it's time with a realization that these characters are at their end and the story converges into a goodbye of sorts from their most important counterparts and their most important segments from the last ten years. This is Endgame's most triumphant segment - the realization of the magnitude of its characters and their meaning in the end - their own humanity and importance that they have for the viewers. However, Endgame holds its most powerful aspects 'til the very end. The climactic battle with Thanos and his army (again) is one that can easily rival Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit or Kingdom of Heaven etc. But, the magnitude of the battle and the number of heroes involved makes the endgame battle so powerful and overwhelming that it leaves the viewer in a perpetual state of adrenaline fulled with hype from start to finish. It is almost impossible to keep track of where all of them are and what they are doing but that is the best part - all of them are completely involved with everything they got - whatever it takes. Even the all-girl battle segment is entertaining and shows how much Marvel respects all of its characters no mater how small their role in any movie was. Up until the end, when Endgame shows it's true colors as Infinity war's successor, when it emotionally destroys almost everyone watching the movie. The final demise is the perfect and flawless ending for one of cinema's most recognizable and lovable heroes. The difficulty of his demise is, at this point, unprecedented. Endgame builds itself all the way up to a spectacular and unforgettable climax that resolves itself in just the perfect and (un)wanted way - perfection.2) The acting. Closely connected to the story are the actors that live the characters they are playing. There is no more acting with these people, the literally are those character down to their very core, and we have lived with them. Though better or worse, through all the trials and errors, thought all the sorrow and pain up until the end, when all of their strength combined (not only as characters but as actors and as people) they gave us an end worthy of legends. An ending that should be studied in movie history books and taught as a principle of movie making. The original Avengers, the ones that made comic book heroes real and important, are the ones that will be remembered after this movie. And they should be regarded as the heroes they have played. What hurts the most is the fact that these people really have feelings for each other and in their goodbyes and tears one really feels sorrow and pain. The soul stone segment and the phone call segment are perfect examples of these segments. But the love that bursts from the screen at the: ""You rest now"" scene
and the tears that flow afterwards are not acting. These kind of emotions do not psychologically constitute as acting - they are real and they are powerful. Because of their connection in such a way do the viewers feel and connect so deeply with some of their demises.3) The direction. To keep such a mastodon of a movie at bay and in such a coherent way is truly masterful. The Russo's directed the movie so that three hours feels more like an hour and a half (maybe the quantum theory is true after all). With so much to be told, and to be told with such respect, no ordinary director could have made this the way they did. It is also important to remember that they have directed MCU's finest movies - The Winter Soldier, Civil War, Infinity War, so they have more than enough practice. Henceforth, their balance of character driven story arks and finishing a ten year old story really makes one wonder how such perfection was achieved. Even though the first 20 minutes of the movie feels a bit too rushed with editing being a bit rigorous, the rest of the movie feels incredibly easy and fluent.4) The music. Silvestry actually did not make two soundtracks but used all the important tunes and themes used so far and combined them into something new and powerful. The start of the Endgame battle music feels and sounds like adrenaline being injected right into ones spine, while the eulogy of the godfather of the MCU sound and feels so emotional and powerful that in comparison to the strength felt merely seconds before creates an emotional burst in the viewers unprecedented in modern cinema.All in all, this is a near perfect movie. A flawless, emotional, powerful ride from start to finish. It is unlike anything one has ever seen or felt while watching a movie. Endgame was, is, and always will be one of the best movies ever made. It will remain in movie history as the most important ending to a story and characters beloved by millions. One does not see Endgame, one feels it, breathes it and lives with it. A long, long time will pass before anyone ever makes something even remotely close to the perfection that is Endgame.",positive
"The movie does have lots of people in it, but Thor is a real joke, and under used, and Hulk too, what where they thinking, also Captain America uses Thor hammer.....The movies lacks what all other movies had action, lots of it, now its replace by useless long and boring chats, the action is missing in most part of the movie.... Also the fact that the movie is 3 plus hours long........Very over rated movie.",positive
"Tamed Hulk, traumatized Ironman, fantasy of yesterday - Cap America. what did I do with my hair - Cpt Marvel . Dr Stranger things and many more with fault of not their own were part of the final movie in one of the most successful and entertaining spectacles of the past decade.
The movie itself was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway.PG-12 rating is a culprit here. If movie's rating was higher I am sure that scenes filled with nothing would be at least more electryfying but because this is a movie aimed at future and former fans, the lighter representation of after apocalypse universe was the only thing Disney corporate machine could have come up with and still get away with achieving PG-12 rating. Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here.The final stand off was amazing though and I will say that it is worth the price of admission. When I will be rematching Endgame on blue ray I think I will just skip to the last few chapters just to experience all this wonderfully done explosions and amazingly done fights. It was just epic and the team definitely raised the bar here.Overall the movie was ok but it did not top IW for me. This one will still be the best Avenger movie.",positive
"Avengers Endgame had a lot to live up to with Infinity War the previous year being the most successful movie of 2018 and with that shocking ending, it shouldn't have disappointed people. Thankfully it didn't.THIS MOVIE WAS THE GREATEST THREE HOURS OF MY LIFE!It didn't feel like a three-hour slugfest like Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit, mind you, there are many elements of Return of the King in the final battle. The story was excellent and really personal and two of our beloved characters were killed off which was really heartbreaking. Both of them sacrifice themselves for their teammates. Black Widow and Tony Stark/Iron Man we have sadly lost and may never see again (The Black Widow movie will be a prequel, by the way.)Yes, you heard right, Marvel Studios had the balls to kill off their biggest character who started it all. Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man. He dies really heroically and the whole shocking event is set really well throughout the movie. He takes the stones from Thanos's gauntlet and uses them against him by saying these awesome words: ""And I... Am... Iron Man!"". The same words he said at the end of his first movie!Another stand-out of the movie is Chris Evans as Captain America. From having him fighting himself from the past, lifting Thor's hammer and getting his shield back at long last. Cap is amazing in this film. I'm going to miss Chris in that role so much. He finally got to say ""Avengers Assemble!"" in this movie and also got a happy ending by living his life with Peggy Carter, growing old and handing over his shield to Sam Wilson. Brilliant moment.That final battle was amazing, seeing every character from the MCU duke it out against Thanos and his army. So many great moments like Cap lifting Mjolnir, Pepper Potts kicking ass as Rescue, Scarlet Witch taking on Thanos and Spider-Man doing his thing.The Russo Brothers really delivered on the action, comedy, emotional weight and the scope of the film. Alan Silvestri's music really makes the movie come alive and that track that plays during Stark's funeral ""The Real Hero"" really makes you burst into tears, it's a beautiful piece that makes the scene flow with emotion. The only things that let movie down is Thor becoming fat and a drunken fool as well as some of the time travel elements being a bit too much but all in all this a great conclusion the Infinity Saga.So, all that's left to do is to say goodbye to this era of the MCU and look to the future which hopefully will start up another amazing story arc as Endgame puts an end to the Infinity Saga. Let's look to the future and see how the MCU carries on being awesome. I still prefer Infinity War as that movie does so many things right but Endgame does deliver as much great fan service as that did. The MCU will continue to expand and I know we are all worried about the future but they'll keep on being badass and amazing with every movie they do.",positive
"Well, it finally happened: I got emotional during a Marvel movie. Sorry, not sorry. This film truly was a fitting conclusion to a decade of MCU films. While it was a classic action sequel, it was also filled with surprises, homages, laughs, and emotional moments. Unfortunately, that's a LOT to accomplish in one movie (hence the 3 hour runtime). Fortunately, almost all of it worked. They wanted to bring 22 movies to an epic climax...mission accomplished. I'm not sure that I would put this one alongside the best stand alone MCU chapters (Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Ragnarok, Iron Man, etc.), but it somehow pulled all those movies together in a pretty magical way. I complain a lot about the comic book-ification of film, but I can also recognize the accomplishment that is the MCU.",positive
"OK I liked the movie , it was the first movie with someone die for no reason that I liked ( no reason meaning it could be an other way , much easier way) the past Avengers movies was like "" Nah! well ok"" Cause you know the whole ""EVERYONE WILL DIE "" was a little bit not so ok . Second thing if Wanda just did what she did in the mini series everyone would be fine! I am not gonna say what she did for the spoilers, but nooo they wanted someone to die and of course it wasn't Spiderman which I realy hate ( He is annoying) it was Iron man , my favourite heroe , thank you Marvel for destroying my childhood . Everyone is like "" He is a hero , he saved everyone "" Nooo its not like that , Wanda could be the hero without dying!!! Or Captain Marvel to absolve all the jem power out of the glove BUT NOO someone had to die right? But if we don't see that part the rest of the movie was AWSOME!!!!",negative
"After watching the premiere tonight, this movie is the best one I have ever seen, Better than Dark Knight. The laughter is on another level with some serious cry because we are in the endgame now, it is expected. The way they have assembled all the 21 movies in 1 epic 3 hour screenplay is completely mind blowing and astonishing. The Russo brothers are pure epitome of perfection to showcase MCU at its best. Thank you MARVEL STUDIOS and STAN LEE for giving us such epicness. Some might not like it, might not remember about it but not us - is what I will tell myself even after 10 more years.",positive
"After seeing ENDGAME for the second time, I'm ready to write my review, which will be difficult to do without spoilers. I find it interesting that those who gave INFINITY WAR a 10 were disappointed in this movie and I think I know why (for I am one of them) - INFINITY WAR took so many characters, such different tones in the worlds of the different heroes, with such a big story arc, yet managed to tell real stories interweaving the larger story, not just 3 minute cameos. ENDGAME, although having real moments of pathos, missed that balance. Despite moments of humour (many at cost of Thor's character, which I didn't appreciate), this movie basically had one tone and I was disappointed how some of our heroes were marginalized (and given bad haircuts). I know it was the end of an era, a passing of the torch. As a friend put it, ""Character development was never the focus of this movie, that was what all the previous movies were for...it was a perfect wrap up and set up for the next arc."" I agree this was all about the ensemble but there were edits (or complete changes) to our heroes' journeys for which I didn't care (too many stories were left off screen) with one exception (Nebula has a character arc). So, that's why I didn't enjoy this as much as INFINITY WAR yet it was still a great movie with great performances by all the cast, poignant moments of loss, great montages in the battle scenes and a real challenge demanding great cost. Kudos to the Russos and Kevin Feige for their hands at the tiller for this era. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Adventure}",positive

"Plot holes,time travel plot has always been bad except maybe God of War 2,from the start it was predictable,and sometimes boring.I expected much more,but infortunately,IW is way better.People that put 9s and 10s are just sheep just because its a marvel movie.Thor and Hulk were just f***d up big time.Thanos compared to the masterfull villain that he was in IW,in Endgame seemed dull and generic.The movie had its good moments and scenes,but mostly the ending counted.A shame that this was ""the endgame"",it could be much more",positive
"I just rewatched Avengers: EndgameAfter 11 years, this is it.... And they pretty much stuck the landing. It borrows heavily from Back To The Future 2, and that's not a bad thing, they even mention Back To The Future.I loved Thor's hammer going to Cap (goosebumps), but I think my favourite part was when Peter Parker first sees Tony Stark, and he starts telling everything that has happened and Tony, so happy to see him, gives him the biggest hug, and despite being shocked at first, Peter cuddles into him and says ""mmmm this is nice"" I actually liked Captain Marvel in this movie. Considerably more than I did in Captain Marvel. I enjoyed Nebula too.I thought fat Thor was funny to start with, but they should have done away with it, by the midway point, the GIRL POWER scene was Cringe-worthy!! I though Don Cheadle's jokes fell flat EVERY time!! Given the situations he makes them, his jokes are awful and badly timed.There are plenty of plot holes and problems with it, The time travel was a lot of fun, but it opens up such a can of worms. Especially the ending, In End Game you can't change your future, by changing the past, as it sinply creates new timelines. Yet Cap decides to stay in the past with Peggy and grows old to meet back up with the team at the end, with all his current knowledge. I'm happy he ended up with Peggy, but it totally went against his character, are we really meant to believe he could just sit idly by as all the bad things happened around him?? It was pretty established that wasn't something he could do. He also stopped Peggy marrying the man who she would marry and have kids with. Changing his life and stopping their children being born.Finally I have to talk about Robert Downey Jr, he IS the MCU!! If the first Iron Man (which worked mainly because of Downey Jr's performance) movie didn't work, there would be no MCU!! And what a way for him to go.... ""I am Iron Man!!"" I'm not going to lie, I cried when he died, in fact I cried a few times. I think it was 4 times in total.Dear, MarvelIf you can arrange for Thor to be in GOTG Vol 3 that would be great.",positive
"I love Marvel Movies, I thought Infinity war was the best superhero movie ever and Thanos the best villain ever. I rated Infinity War with an absolute 10.But lets talk about this one. The expectations were very high of course, thanks to the first masterpiece.But this one has so many plot holes that it is ridiculous. I ll start with the movie itself first though.The pacing of the movie is slow and what I saw in the theaters does not justify 3 hours. They dragged it so muchThe fight scene happens in the end and there is no time to showcase each hero efficiently. Infinity was great because there was correct pacing and enough screen time for most heroesThey destroyed Thor's character. Thor is willing to sacrifice his life to avenge the deaths of his loved ones in Infinity War and he is so powerful with Stormbreaker that he nearly succeeds in killing Thanos. Yet when 2014 Thanos comes in, bearing no stones, Thor with BOTH Stormbreaker and Mjolnir is nothing for him. Man, how can you not consider this when making the movie?Hulk 100% sidelined once again. He is the original, strongest Avenger (or among the 2). Disappointing.Time traveling scenes are nothing more than references and fan service, no substanceCaptain marvel strong arms Thanos! Really? He might not be able to snap his fingers but he still has the power of the stones running through his body. He doesn't have to grab a stone with his left hand!Natasha's death was not dramatic. It was brushed off as humor! Terrible, just terrible.How anti-climatic to end the movie with a snap from Stark. I get it, contracts are over and stuff but that was weak for my tasteNow the many plot holes that sucked me out of the movie:The traveling back in time is an epiphany that they suddenly all inherently know the rules. Effortlessly. It doesn't feel earned. But lets forget that for a moment.The pim particle is used to timetravel 1 person. They were traveling in groups to the same timeline so, if it was possible to timetravel a whole gigantic ship with 1 particle like 2014 Nebula did, you would think that our heroes would use just 1 per group. Bu no. Our heroes use 1 per person. Thanos uses 1 for a freaking army.2014 Nebula can teleport that whole army with her hands doing that magic. So, 2019 Nebula could not? She is a better enhanced version of her 2014 self by definition!!!Nebula never tells them before hand that Thanos might be there BEFORE they go thereThe Soul Stone. Oh boy. Nebula knows what needs to be done to get it. She once again tells no one! Plus, the whole point is that you have to sacrifice your true love to get it! Not race with your friend on who gets to kill himself first! Clint didn't kill Natasha. He tried to save her. And she was not his true love, like Gamora was to Thanos.They do not want to create different timelines but they do. Thanos no longer exists in that past timeline as he gets killed prematurely, 5 years earlier. This means that he is not there to take those same actions as before, go after the stones, send people for the stones, do the snap. Nothing.Captain Marvel can fly in space. Yet, she takes the gauntlet and tries to fly through the battlefield! Just take it and fly away damn it! Fly over them!They send Captain America back with all the infinity stones, in a briefcase, all by himself!! Do you know how many villain can take a briefcase from Captain America????!!! IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSECaptain America goes back once for all stones. These were taken from different timelines. He should have traveled 4 distinct times, not 1. This in not 1 timeline from which all the stones are missing. These are 4 distinct timelines.Captain America doesn't use the pim particle to come back. It is implied that he ends up near the lake naturally, he stayed back, leaved his life and aged. So, this means that he ended up in this timeline, which can't happen! He is in a different timeline, in the past!!!!!! This definitely wont lead to the same events, nothing as we know it. He can't just jump between timelines without the particle so that he meets Hulk and the others here! Just think about it for a sec!In this timeline the snap has happened. In Captain's new timeline, there are 2 captain America's first of all! But we are not meddling with time lines and stuff.I have more but I think I made my point.",positive
"I thought the mcu was going to change after infinity war but this garbage proved me wrong. I thought they would stop doing the same generic garbage crap after infinity war but nope.

"I've been waiting for this moment for 11 years I grew up with marvel as I could not stand tony's death first because I cried because it was our first eye pain that we filmed the first half-hour in the first half an hour or something, moving forward after a ride was a construction of the eternity stones sent us into ancient times We understood the importance of time and it was nice to see the ancient one again, and the room was aware of everything, they took the stones stark made their own glove and the hulk snapped her finger and everyone came back now, you know where the enemies are! such a battle is not the greatest battle in the history of the film captain america is also taking an attractive abooo. :) then ours is taking tony dying captain goes to the past and goes on with margaret carter and then comes to the old state falcona is giving the shield to the new captain america she is leaving thor asgard kingdom to valkrie and joining guardians of the galaxy he ends.",positive

"Avengers: Endgame is a depressing and emotional conclusion of the long awaiting Infinity Saga. The final product is not what I had hoped for, but the Russo Brothers created something special that reflex the wholesome of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This film marks the end of an era for some of our beloved characters that we cherished and loved. Going down memory lane is not an easy task, but we sit through 181 minutes to say goodbye to our favorite Avenger. A proper farewell is necessary for Tony Stark and Robert Downey Jr. Because he helped to build this franchise juggernaut that reaping billions at the box office.As the first Avenger and leader of the world's mightiest heroes, Steve Rogers will always be the patron saint of the MCU. Chris Evans helped to shape Captain America as the poster boy for American patriotism and his departure will leave a huge gap and we can hope that his new successor will continue his path of righteousness and compassion.Avengers: Endgame failed Black Widow and she deserves better.",positive

"I'm a huge fan of long slow-crawl movies (cue LOTR trilogy) but the first half of this culminating slog was way too slow and artificially melodramatic. This is in stark contrast to Infinity War's well edited, if not somewhat fractured fast paced scenes.If anything Infinity War could of used an extra 20min of dialogue and slower pacing edited out of Endgame. In the end, still a fun movie but not without obvious pacing flaws.",positive
"There was so much hype about this movie. The social media made a good deal of fuzz about the ticket records it broke, its length etc, etc.To start with the obvious: It's not a bad Marvel Movie. But it's surely not the best. Regarding the script and the pace, I think it reminds me something like Avengers 2 and Thor 2 and that's not the best movies Marvel made.To me, Thor 3 is the best movie of all Marvel Universe, because it has a super good balance between action, dialogs, script, and humor. You never felt bored, you never felt you knew what's coming.On Endgame, sometimes I felt bored. It was a combination of medicre editing, script or acting. For example, fat Thor joke wasn't halve as good as bad haircut Thor. The scenes that should produce laughs, were between average and good.Although 3 hours long, it failed to show the extension of misery the planet has fallen into. In the opening scenes they easily kill Thanos, next scene misery, third scene hope, fourth scene Stark rejects the idea of time travel, next scene he finds the solution, next scene, the machine is ready. It's the very same Tony Stark that on Iron Man 2 spend half a movie trying to figure out how to create a new element.Time travel movies are always problematic because no matter how much mumbo jumbo terminology you add, the truth is that no matter how the heroes avoid to interact or change the future, their own existance on the past will change their universe. So, Endgame can laugh about Hot Tub Time Machine, but the truth is, it is still a HTTM movie.. ;DAlso, it's disappointing to continiously upgrade Thor's powers and on the final battle scenes, to take them back without a proper explanation. Thor easily defeated a Thanos that was on the maximum of his powers using the Infinity Gauntled on Infinity War, but on Endgame, he's unable to beat him even without Thanos having full power! That's silly.Yes it's a huge movie and even with 30 second cameos from top actors like Robert Redford or Michael Douglas you should need 1 hour for all characters but in the end, it's not about how many people you will squeeze into the movie. It's about how you will build a good pace with balanced action and humor.Maybe it's about the fact that everybody pretty much knew how things would end while on other movies like Thor 3, things were a bit more chaotic. Maybe it's because there wasn't much time about showing the details of a 5 year period. Maybe it was the fact that the first memory that jumps into my mind every time I recall the movie is Black Widow standing on a desk and coordinating x-avengers. Maybe is the fact that Thor from an arrogant young person, became super-strong in 5 movies (Thor 1,2,3, Avengers 1,2) and then, back to mediocre again. Maybe is the fact that Hulk was portrayed like the Beast from X-Men now. Maybe it was because we never got answers from the previous movie, like what Loki meant when he talked about the sun rising again, or why Hulk refused to help Banner. Even on this movie, Hawkeye becoming a renegade, makes no sense. All heroes that presented a second chance (Stark, Thor, Hawkeye) react like ""Nah, I will pass"" instead of be super-excited about it. I know 5 years passed, but the movie fails to show how this period changed our heroes.Thanos final fight on Infinity War, much inferior to that of Endgame.
Humor much much inferior to Thor3.Of course it is not a bad movie, but it could epic - and despite all those Anchorman cameos, it's not. But I guess, when you have limited time to repeat a wordwide success, surely you will have fails now and then.Endgame was destined to be an epic ending. It was. But only 8 out of 10.",positive
"I watched this the day after ploughing through the first season of 'The Boys'. What an anti-climax... If you want a super hero story that's intelligent, incredibly well-written, and with really interesting characters, go watch that instead... And in the MCU context, the first Avengers film is a much better example of good writing and directing, where the characters actually had some wit and.. yeah, well... character....The best thing I can say about Avengers: Endgame is that it very early on killed off Thanos and the Infinity Stones. That was unexpected and opened up the possibilities for the rest of the film. Except that it went straight on to a classic time-travel solution and makes a big deal out of this not being at all like described in any other film (except that it's exactly the same) along with an abundance of other cliches and plot holes (well described in the many other critical reviews here). The characters and their lines were generally bland and completely without the wit and bite as seen in the earlier Joss Whedon versions. And the ending was just as painfully slow as LotR: The Return of the King (yet another over-hyped blockbuster) with long-drawn-out overly sentimental scenes that added nothing to the story.6/10 = OK (just)",positive
"This will go down as the best Marvel movie ever created. During the first hour it's like a pick up of where they left off in Infinity War, it's like shattered glass you don't even know where to start to put pieces back together,2nd hour it starts to get fun and exciting and it's like this is what we came here to do and we better make it worth it, bc we only have one shot.The last hour are the moments everyone has been waiting for, and the last final battle scene is the best action scene ever made. The people who made it deserve some type of an award for making something from a comic and putting it onto the big screen, I'm not even overrating it. All you heard in the theater was sniffles, it was absolutely breathtaking.SPOILER* (Do not continue reading if you don't want to know this)
Only negative OPINION I have is the Fact that Hulk was a total waste of character they definitely could've used him ALOT more. MCU has made hulk a JOKE. He didn't even fight. They need to just cancel his character, his character was a huge disappointment like really.",positive
"There must be a lot of brainless fan boys highly rating this movie ... compared to its predecessor (Infinity War) Endgame was a real let down.
I won't reveal spoilers. But I will say the pacing was very bad.... very very slow at the start to the point I was nodding off in the theatre .... the movie before had great pacing of action, drama and comedy...... Endgames first half was just boring.
Also balance of heroes in the first movie was done much better than this movie which really should have been called Captain America & Iron Man + Avengers.
And time travel as a plot device is a very lazy way of solving issues ... I cringed when that came up ........ Thanos and his lieutenants were a threat in Infinity War... in this movie they felt really dumbed down.",positive
"If you go see this movie, go see it in an IMAX 3D or something like that because 3 hours is too long for this movie.The story is really bad I van understand that they don't want to repeat the same story in the comic book but the reason why Thanos choose to wipeout half the population is just stupid and what he do after that? Yeah he destroy the stone and retire. What a great villain...So our super hero go take care of Thanos easily and then nothing for a very long period of time. For a Marvel movie their is not much action and for an intelligent, deep or funny movie that's not a bad thing but for a movie like this it's just boring. I guess they think that since their is a lot of action at the end that we will forget the middle.They other thing that really bother's me is how important it seem to show how strong women are. The power of women yeah... Men are lazy, dumb and useless like thor in this movie and women are strong and save the day like Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, Gamora etc.Marvel's writers must understand that Easter eggs, some action at the end of the film and showing the power of feminity do not make up for a bad script.the only thing that I really like in this movie is that finally we saw some hero die.",negative
"It was Great ending but also emotional.
When I remember the first avengers film and now the ending of the avengers, I was very emotional
Especially, when Two Avengers die (Iron Man and Black Widow).
At the ending of the film, It was like 3rd world war.I LOVE YOU 3000",positive
"A fitting end to a 22 movie story. It is not a full blown action packed Avengers movie, but what it does, and it does it very well, is wrap up everything in close to 3 hours with respect to everything that's gone before it.
No spoilers here, but you'll enjoy the action, laugh at the humour and it will (probably) make you sad in parts. Loved the last couple of scenes especially. It's unusual to be able to watch 2 excellent films in 1 week (Joker being the other).",positive
"How in the hell did Marvel Studios pull this off. A epic conclusion to 11 years of films and the epic follow up to Infinity War. Some how the 3 hours long movie does not get boring at any point. I love seeing the world after the snap and the time heist is fun look back to other MCU movies. Plus the final hour of the movie is what I am just going to say has the best movie scene of all time. The most epic battle from Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man vs Thanos and all Avengers characters against Thanos and his forces. Love it!!!!!!!!!",positive
"Avengers Endgame Review
Score - 10/10
Avengers Endgame could be well described as the most complicated storyline in the entire Marvel history not only because it had to wrap up a story of eleven years but also because of the complex solution to an inevitable situation that The Avengers try to achieve with the avenging not being the major part of the story.
The three hour runtime was well utilized by giving more time to establish the characters' humanistic attachments and the losses they suffered; not only in this movie, but from the very moment they've been incepted into this franchise.
Unlike the previous outings, the characters differ in their choices and these contrasts in their choices lead up to one massive and satisfying final battle which may not end the entire MCU, but certainly does end a glorious era of the long franchise.
The entire movie, especially the final battle was a huge fan service as it included everything a Marvel fan could possibly dream of.
PS: There is no Post - Credits Scene in the film, but it is worth waiting for the entire credits to roll.",positive
"The end of an era! The hard core fans will absolutely love endgame as it's really does round of the series with awesome cameos from various films. If you've been attached to the MCU through out and watched all the others, you'll love this. (Visiting Guardians 1 or Avengers Assemble) However if you're a casual fan you may not get as excited when Captain America says ""Avengers assemble"". A line we've all been waiting for since the beginning, or appreciating Captain America welding the Mjolnir since the teaser from Age of Ultron.However it's not as fast paced as infinity war and more predictable than infinity war. We knew someone would die at Volmir for example and very likely Stark would be a sacrifice due to strange handing over the time stone. The film started off slow, however had an awesome finish!Overall film is 8/10 from me! I think the film was amazing, but perhaps needed to be little more faced paced like infinity war and less character development (we've had 22 movies) well worth watching!",positive
"* Why buildup Thor only to tear him to shreds in Endgame? You literally destroyed his brand.
* How was Captain Marvel able to locate the ship Tony Stark was on at the beginning of the film?
* Why use ""Quantum Realm"" when the majority of the audience will get confused and lost in it?
* Why did Captain Marvel say she was going to fight Thanos solo when she, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man couldn't even take him down without a use of a gauntlet? Is she really that arrogant?
* Why was Thanos awesome in the first movie, but became a generic villain in Endgame?
* Why did the writers do an awesome job on the infinity war, but fall hard in Endgame? Did someone just tell them, ""let's put all the jokes and scenes you guys want and hopefully it makes sense."" Because that's exactly what it felt like.
* Why doesn't doing anything in the past affect the future? It felt so cringeworthy seeing interactions in previous movies that weren't meant to happen.
* Why has Thor become Batman of the DC universe? Do directors and producers LOVE destroying characters that we love? Seems like it.
* Thor's mother didn't need to be ""trained by witches"" to know that her son Thor was different from her son she saw only moments earlier. So why even bring that up?
* Did everyone who ""died"" in infinity war go to a special spirit world of wakanda and just remain there till 5 years later according to spider-man?
* Why couldn't have anyone simply put on the gauntlet and wiped out Thanoses army? And why didn't Thanos destroy everybody who was a threat to him in infinity war?
* Why did a rat start Endgame by returning ant-man? That seems awfully convenient doesn't it?
* How can Captain America pick up Thor's hammer and even use lightning when he couldn't pick it up in the first avengers movie?
* Where was Captain Marvel most of the movie? Was she vacationing?
* Why was the first hour so slow, The second hour and a half talking about quantum physics that no one understands, and the last 30 minutes of the film fighting when anyone could have simply worn the glove and wiped out thanoses army?
* How did Scarlett Witch seemingly become more powerful than even Captain Marvel?
* Why didn't anyone save Black Widow when everything else can be done with convenience? Did no one just not want to save her because there was no purpose and it just gave them rage to fight?There's a hundred more questions I want to ask, but these are just some of the main ones.",positive
"If you go into this movie thinking that you're going to get an Infinity Wars part II I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed. I enjoyed the movie, but I was hoping for so much more, and yes, I know, when you go into a movie with high expectations the chances are that you're setting yourself up for disappointment, but the more I think about this movie the more I hate the direction it took.
Now..obvious mistakes aside (Capt America with the power of lightning?...really??...it was literally explained in Ragnarok) the way they destroyed some of the best characters was completely frustrating, Lebowski Thor?....Slimey Hulk?.......a Thanos that you couldn't empathise with even though you knew it was wrong?.....meh....
The thing is, once you introduce time travel into a movie you're going to spend the rest of your days wondering 'why didn't they just....' unless it's done really intelligently, unfortunately this falls very short of that mark, and as whole...when I think about the film now, it just feels like a bit of an over emotional fan film, an MCU scrapbook of nostalgia that despite being 3 hours long...still felt incredibly rushed.
The biggest moment in ten years of Marvel movies was 'The Snap' ...yet in Endgame you don't even get to see any of effect of reversing it??....apart from a phone call from Hawkeye's wife?....baffling.
Throughout most of this film I felt like I was watching a parody, it's something you still have to watch.....and you'll probably enjoy it, just as long as you don't think about it afterwards.",positive
"I did not expect to see in my life such a faithful rendition of my childhood heroes from the comics to the big screen ... the emotions was huge ... the only reason I kept and did not cry in the cinema was because I was shy not to see me ... . From Athens Greece Thank you STAN LEE for filling my childhood with those fantastic stories and heroes ,also Russo and marvel because you have respected our comic heroes on the big screen ... my only sadness is that we could not see avengers together with XMEN- fantastic four -Daredevil in the same movie, but you can not have it all at life",positive
"When I say that Avengers Engame is the most overrated movie of 2019, I mean that people and critics praised it more, the movie, yes, you could say that it is ""good"", but not so much for everyone to go crazy and say that it is the best superhero movie, a great example of how overrated it would be like, this movie was recently titled as the highest grossing movie in the history of cinema in general. Yes, if the film is very striking with its colors and all those characters, but simply what in Avengers Infinity War ""struggled"" to maintain the quality of the plot, here it simply does not matter, I just say that Captain Marvel suddenly find Tony and the other lady, they do not explain at any time how he did to find them, yes, if I know that the marvel lovers have already drawn their theories on that, to cover up the lazy mistakes of the writers. In Infinity War we saw the Thor plus Thor of the Thores, but now he is an obese alcoholic, the movie is not taken seriously sometimes, and that is a great example, or that Tony gets angry at first with Captain America because he does not It was there, blah, blah, blah, but if we use our brains, you will remember that in Infinity War he had the opportunity to call him and he did not, so I'm sorry Iron man lovers, but Tony had no right to get angry, and if we analyzed him well really Captain Marvel was a filler character, we all believed that this character would have great weight for the story but no, I thought that they did not try hard in their movie because they were going to want all this, but no, you can feel that the writers they didn't know what to do with it, and something they did go over with was the rat that accidentally released Ant-man, I'm just saying that you are more likely to see a cow flying outside your house to have that happen, which I leave wondering if the truck was closed, then how did that rat could get in? The time travel is very badly done, quantum physics clearly says that two equal objects cannot be together at the same time in the same place, so that fight of the American captains is impossible, and the rest is not even said , for example, Captain America in the end stays in the past meaning that The Avengers never had Captain America, which means that everything he did never happens, which leaves me wondering. Why did nothing change? Why is there no temporary paradox or any consequence for your decision? It's simple, the movie is so shameless in the sense that it doesn't care about those rules and does what it gives the gift wins. After that for no reason, Steve gives his position to Falcon because ............. in order to make a reference to the comics, he prefers to give his position to an African-American who he met recently Than your lifelong friend. Something that I honestly didn't understand, was how the gauntlet works, are you supposed to think about what you want and what happens? I don't know, I think, because Hulk throne his fingers and half of the universe that had disappeared comes back, but here goes the problem, if you think about it that is the worst thing he had to do, Thanos technically had already saved the universe by reducing the population , and that was something that the Avengers failed to understand, but that is the least, the problem is that being logical, of that half world literally literally, I wonder where the hell are all these people going to live? 5 years have passed and obviously their houses must already be inhabited by someone else, or their jobs, and logically they should have had an economic imbalance, but hey, the Avengers don't care about that and they are happy because they saved their friends, just I say his plan was very selfish. If you think about it really, the one who lost the most was Thanos, his goal was really not bad, that for starters, even in a part of the movie Steve tells Natasha something that the planet is less polluted Thanos was looking for his stones for a long time time and when he found the last one to get it he had to sacrifice his daughter, he also lost his friends, henchmen or not dry were, then after saving the universe, he just wanted to live in peace and eat his broth, but the Avengers do not arrive and they kill him, then they make a plan for all their sacrifices to go to waste, poor Thanos. To tell the truth that Hulk is now Hulk-Banner does not really bother me, what I would have liked is that they would have spent time on that, for example a movie of that would not be bad. But well now talk about how good this movie has, and I'd like to start with those little big details, which would be like Hulk uses a pencil to press the keys because his fingers are too big, or that Iron Man gives the hug to that Spiderman did not want to give him at Homecomeming, also that Bucky tells Steve that he is going to miss him although he is supposed to only leave for a few seconds, but it is because he knows him enough to know that Steve is going to live his life, and that that would be the last time he sees him young and for me that he is the best he would be being that in the final battle with Thanos, Thor every blow he hits is directed at Thanos's head. And as brave as it has been to kill Ironman, it was really a bit forced, although the only thing I managed to sacrifice was to avoid the salvation of the universe. I will analyze the advantage and cons. Pros: -Give more years of life to humanity before it destroys itself. -They managed to complete their goal. Cons: -To condemn humanity. -Leave his wife a widow. -Let your daughter an orphan. - Wreck the work of a visionary. -Kill oneself. But the point is that the greatest hero of Marvel was sacrificed, the man who created Ultron, the man who caused the civil war between his companions and then locked them in, the man who created all those marvel villains like the Vulture , Mystery, Mandarin, etc. But hey, goodbye Ironman. So and I have two questions for marvel lovers. How is it possible for a human being to create a gauntlet that supports the gems of infinity, when Infinity War told us that only a certain metal made by certain dwarves can do it? The only conclusion I reach is that Tony is a god or a celestial being. I also understand that if he is a god, he would be Ojo de Alcon, since he is in a moment of the movie he grabs a gem of the infinite with his hand and in guardians of the galaxy I learned that only a celestial or a god can grab the gems without dying, and in this movie, Ojo de alcon grabs it and nothing happens, so I understand that this man is a god or a celestial. Do not? Something that I admire about this movie is that it is very good lying, to this I mean that it is so good lying that it made half the world believe that it is the best film not only of the year, not only of the genre of Super-heroes, but of the best movies in history, they are good lying that with the jokes, the characters, the fights and all those colors of this movie, it covers all those plot holes and makes people believe that it is an almost perfect movie, so it is of Men recognize that this movie cheated the world and almost fooled me. In conclusion Avengers Endgame is a very good movie lying, with a great final battle, and with many plot holes, I just want to say that I found it very difficult to put the rating on this movie, it was between 4 to 6, but then I decided that This is only a 6/10, even though deep down in my heart I know it deserves less.",positive
"Time travel destroys any film...time travel doesnt exist in the physical world..its an invention of writers and authors to close plot holes and impress audiances...so, any film or book containing time travel, IS A MESS! so, i dont see any reason to grade this movie more than 2 stars...cgi, fights, ok , but a real good movie, must have a believable story! for me, sorry it didnt work...
question...why thor and hulk had to be humiliated so much in this movie ? why toni stark had to die? to offer the framatic essence to the story?is this the end of marvel heroes?",negative
"(Before starting reading remember: this is MY opinion and how I felt by watching this movie. If you didn't enjoy it...I am sorry for you.)I will never be so hyped again for a movie in general. This is the perfect conclusion for a 10 years old saga. It closes the arches of the main characters and opens some for the new ones. The battle scenes are awesome, the themes too, perfect character narration and development. Maybe the plot is a little bit simple and predictable, but sometimes you don't need a complex one to do a perfect movie. You can't judge a movie only by one aspect of itself. Infinity war was the ACTION part, endgame was the FEELINGS part.
Yes, infinity war was better, but this movie also has its moments.One of the best experiences I had in a theater, we cried, we laughed, we smiled. almost PERFECTION.",positive
"Some people said there's so few fights scenes and it's boring. But if you watch MCU whole, you know what is this all aboutMovie is just iconic. I remember how strong my heart was beating in the final battle. Everyone who worked on this movie did best they can. I gave only 4-5 movies 10 stars , and Endgame absolutely deserves it.",positive
"Brilliant flow; they had a lot to cover and they managed to utilize the entire 3 hours without it feeling stretched out.Littered with throwbacks and references to the previous movies. It was delightful to revisit some of my favorite scenes, specifically the Guardians of the Galaxy opening (I may be biased because I love the song).Had some really amazing moments. Scott's return to the present and all his interactions. I've always felt Ant-Man doesn't get enough love, and in this one he literally saves the universe (thanks to the rat who turns on the quantum tunnel). Was nice to see Korg and meek return. Professor Hulk as well - now we know why Heimdall saved him first in Infinity War.Time heists - I got goosebumps seeing the familiar sequences from a new perspective. Kind of like behind the scenes. Watching Quill sing Come and get your Love, Jarvis, Howard, aftermath of NY battle, ancient one, events from the dark world. Really amazing.And ofcourse, undoing the snap and the memorable Avengers, Assemble scene were executed perfectly.However, didn't really like two aspects:1) Plot holes. In Infinity War, Thanos with the fully loaded infinity gauntlet couldn't stop Thor's stormbreaker. But the Thanos without the gauntlet, equipped with just a blade manages to overpower not just Thor (with two weapons) AND Cap + Iron Man. Please.2) The cringey ""woman power"" scene in the final battle where all the female heroes come together. Seemed really forced and just ruined the immersion. Can we just stop bringing up gender just for the sake of it?",positive

"To witness the end of this legendary franchise is bittersweet. This movie makes one cry, laugh, smile, think, cheer, worry, and imagine. It is perfection. Everything from acting, directing, sound effects, and storytelling is flawless. I watched it twice already and I am eager to watch it again.",positive
"What a cinema experience. Saw this opening night and the cheering that erupted at certain points gave instant goosebumps. A couple of legendary moments in the movie that I will never forget. Nothing has come close and I feel like nothing else ever will. Over 20 movies have led to this, and Endgame delivered big time.There really isn't much else to say. The movie is packed full of every emotion. One simply has to have made the great journey to appreciate this masterpiece. This is the peak of the MCU and I fear it will only decline, but time will tell.",positive
"Is the film underwhelming? Yes. It is still good? Yes. With all of the hype i saw on social media and my friend's conversations I had extremely great high hopes for this film however I was left slightly dissatisfied.At 3 hours, the film is way too long and it can drag sometimes, especially in the tedious build up of the first half of the film.Whilst the second half of the film is quicker paced and more enjoyable, including a very well choreographed, action packed end fight scene, I had felt i has seen it all before when thinking about the fight scene in Wakanda in Infinity War and so this wasn't anything special to me. The only thing I did really enjoy about this scene was the return of the fallen soldiers through Dr. Strange's portals. For me, this was one of the best sequences of the entire film.Similarly, the payoff for the culmination of the fight scene- the Avengers defeating Thanos- was anticlimactic. The writers of the film were not going
to have the Avengers lose their final outing and so I fully expected this to happen. Contrast this with last year's infinity war, where I was left utterly shocked at the fact the Avengers, who had been built up as an unstoppable force over the previous 2 films, had lost. My jaw was at the floor in the cinema at the time. It was this complete unexpectedness of the climax of Infinity War that makes me believe, however unpopular this may be, that Infinity War was better than Endgame.This film is still however good. The cast are, as always, great in their roles and the production value is fantastic, which makes for some beautiful looking scenes. All of the jokes (bar Korg playing Fortnite and Hulk dabbing) land, as does equally the action sequences. The addition of new characters in the Avengers series, such as Captain Marvel, are a welcomed addition and inject some fresh blood into the already solid cast, even with their minute amount of screen time (seriously, Captain Marvel had more haircuts than minutes on screen).The plot is solid, although the time travel aspect is confusing at times. Similarly, the plot does open some gaping plot holes. Why are the Guardians of the Galaxy searching for Gamora when they ran into her in the fight scene? (I will admit I'm not a hardcore Marvel fan and so maybe missing something) and how can Captain America suddenly pick up Thor's hammer? (I definitely AM missing something there). Thirdly, there are continuity errors. Thanos tears Iron Man, Captain America and Thor and their respective weaponry apart all at the same time WITHOUT the gauntlet. Thanos is strong, but not that strong.The ending however was the perfect culmination of 22 films over the last 11 years. It tied everything together nicely and gave almost every character a satisfying ending, especially Captain America. Even the end credits with each actors signature were damn beautiful. It didn't bring me to tears but it did make me feel emotional.The Avengers films have been some of my favourite films over the last few years and so to see it end is saddening. This film could have been much better but I am not disappointed with the way the ended it. It really is the end of an era.",positive
"Walking in, given Marvel's latest publicity, I was expecting, well, I was expecting an absolute cringe fest, and thankfully I didn't get it. In fact, there were only a couple of absolute cringe moments and each dealt with Brie Larson, particularly her appearance in the final fight.Thankfully though, Marvel showed a lot of restraint with that and as a result the movie really belonged to the characters that we all have invested over a decade of love and loyalty in....and honestly that was a relief. There were times where the film looked like it wanted to go the other way, and put the OG Avengers in the backseat. So, credit for not doing that.It feels a lot more like Kill Bill 2 in atmosphere than a real Super-Hero movie, all the really fun big fights were reserved for the first film and what's left is a long closing act that is more concerned with tying up loose ends than delivering on over-the-top action. And it works for a send off film after a decade of investment.So what you have feels very much like an intimate and sentimental film made by old friends at send off...or a funeral...but in either case it is absolutely appropriate.Unfortunately, you have the enormously epic CGI battle at the end and I, for one, am kind of done with that trope. It's starting to bore me now, and, honestly, I would prefer something a little more authentic. But, that being said, the film at least called for it.We've seen battles like that before, Black Panther, Aquaman, Infinity War, Lord of the Rings, and, honestly those CGI armies lack any real intimacy. So the end is kind of a bore compared to the rest of the film.The highlight in the film would be Thor with Hulk coming in as a close second. They steal the show from the moment they are introduced and the trademark MCU humor that Black Panther and Captain Marvel utterly lacked. And the humor was a source of comfort after two films that made vague threats of taking themselves far too seriously for a superhero flick.The wrap-up was more than satisfying if not heart-wrenching at moments making it a great send off for a decade of time and money invested in the characters, however the legacy that the MCU is passing on seems in trouble nonetheless and we can only hope that it doesn't go the route that the MCU has been teasing and toying with and continues to deliver fun superhero movies and not the heavy-handed or deadly serious films they have threatened the audience with.",positive
"There's a moment in one of Scream franchise openings that a girl makes a comment about the Stab franchise (the movie series within the movie). She says that even Stab series used time traveling because that's what they do when there's nothing else to tell.Funny enough, some of the Avengers makes a quite similar observation when Ant Man comes with this cliche idea. That was exactly the moment that I did remember that quote from Scream. And I couldn't expect anything different from that on.Infinity War was an amazing movie, first because it gave us all the feeling that heroes can fall, and villains can be more than just bad guys without purpose.Thanos is a villain because he was created that way, but his vision about the world and universe are unique and makes sense in his mind. When he snap his fingers and random people start disappearing, Infinity War made its point.At first, Infinity War was to be a movie divided in two parts, and the second part being the consequences and resolutions about the world after Thanos. A new era was about to be born, but suddenly it was stated that the 4th movie wouldn't be that way anymore.After finally watching Endgame, the reasons for that changes are very clear to me.First thing is that most of the fans couldn't stand the fact that some heroes have died, so writers had to think about a differet resolution to please them. Second is that Marvel failed to use it as an element of surprise to Endgame.What we see during 3 hours is an empty movie struggling to keep the pace of an entire cinematic universe created throughout a decade.As a whole, Endgame is only a redone version of Infinity War, and not exactly a follow up as it might seems. The consequences and resolutions are redundant when compared to the tragic ending of previous one. And yes, the time travelling plot was nothing else but a comfort zone to retell a story in a simpler way for the sake of a true ending.So, the clueless girl from Scream was right.Endgame had much more to tell than the way it was done. The plot development could have had dozen of different paths, and each one would have been much more interesting and still satisfying.I really don't understand how this movie became the biggest box office in history, because together with Age Of Ultron, is the weakest movie of the entire saga and entire MCU.",positive
"While I respect the fans going ga ga and people discussing the emotions etc, I beg to differ. I saw this movie yesterday after all the rush had died out. There were about 25-30 people in the Audi having seating capacity of approx 250.Pace: The buildup is slow and boring.Emotions: Forced and sometimes looks very artificial. You don't feel a thing. When some people said that they cried, I wonder for what. Action: It comes late and is limited. I expected more (isnt that expected in the avengers movies?)CGI: Was good.Storyline: Very weak. It could have been refined. Many of the characters were inserted and wasted.Length: It was unnecessarily prolonged, esp towards the end. They could have reduced the runtime by 20-30 minutes.Overall: Bad. Barely a one time watch, with lots of patience. The studios have created the hype and made their money. The previous avenger movie was way better. This one was a totally let down, just like the Game of Thrones final season.",negative
"Finally, the long-awaited conclusion of a saga that was weaved ingeniously and meticulously for a decade by the House of Ideas, under the command of Kevin Feige. If before the studios practically did not bet on superhero films, ten years ago this reality changed completely when we saw ""Iron Man (2008)"" debut in theaters around the world, beginning a wide, complex and detailed shared universe, which gave life to characters that fans so longed to see transported to the cinema and becoming acquainted with others not so popular even among comic book fans. There were three phases that became known as the ""Infinity Saga"", in which we became intimate with Iron Homme, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange.Filmed simultaneously with ""Infinite War"", the Russo brothers and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely continue to tell the story of the previous film. Here, superheroes must deal with the events of the previous film, in which half of the people in the galaxy were wiped out at Thanos' snap, including friends and family of our heroes. Those who are left are still, for more than three weeks, trying to locate Thanos who entered a portal and disappeared, while trying to find a solution to reverse what had happened.The first fifteen minutes invest in revenge and the consummation of failure: an introduction. The next sequences, which make up a first, more melancholic, yet vigorous act in re-presenting characters and renewing the previous status quo, have an emphasis on the intimate, precisely what drives Ultimato as an experience: a great show on a colossal scale, but that cares about a dance, a feeling, a heart, a family.""Ultimatum"" gets it right by dedicating more than half its duration to intensify the hopelessness, mourning and disbelief that the characters and the audience were going through together. In that time, he takes the opportunity to strengthen ties between unlikely characters, such as Toby Stark and Nebula, and also to show how old friends, such as Natasha, Rogers and Barton, Tony and Thor and Bruce, led their lives five years after the events of the beginning of the movie. The characters have their own layers, monsters and voids, to add to the project itself, which is a mooring of several narrative arches, the sustenance of a three-hour cathartic work. Especially interesting is Tony's bow, living alongside his great love and his little daughter, being the counterpoint to Barton, who had his life transformed after the loss of his family, becoming a vengeful murderer who eliminates those he does not consider worthy. Meanwhile, Carol Danvers went on to help other planets that also suffered from Thanos' actions.After the presentation of the current situation of each of the heroes, it is when Scott Lang enters the story, who managed to return from the quantum kingdom, after the post-credits scenes that we had followed in ""Ant Man and the Wasp"". He then explains that the laws of physics and space-time do not apply to the quantum realm, theorizing that they could travel through time through the Pym Particles and the portal. From there, after seeing an old photo of him with Peter Parker, Tony ends the time travel equation and the Avengers, with the exception of Danvers, split into groups to return to the past and retrieve the Infinity Stones and that's when Marvel takes audiences on an unforgettable journey celebrating 11 years of their shared universe, revisiting films like ""The Avengers"", ""Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and even the controversial ""Thor: The Dark World"" .Banner, Rogers, Lang and Stark return to 2012, during Loki's invasion of New York, to retrieve the Tesseract, Loki's scepter and the Eye of Agamotto. They also end up going to 1970 at the S.H.I.E.L.D. in Lehigh to get another version of the Tesseract, which was being tested by the military and to get more particles from Hank Pym, who had just invented them. Meanwhile, Thor and Rocket return to Asgard in 2013 to extract Jane Foster's Reality Gem. Clint and Natasha return to Vormir in 2014 to retrieve the Soul Gem, while Rhodes and Nebula go to Morag, also in 2014, where Peter Quill is about to steal the Gem of Power. This whole time travel will culminate in the great final battle, after Thanos discovering the heroes' plan, where the destiny of the universe will be at stake again.The cast reaches the height of their characters' understanding, completing a whole development arc. In addition to the main cast, which is already extremely numerous, there are still several cameos from great actors and actresses who showed up in previous productions. Robert Redford, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Tilda Swinton, Natalie Portman, William Hurt, are just a few of those names, and some of them literally go silent and leave quietly.With a million dollar budget of US $ 356 million, the film justifies the use of every penny and obviously will not have any difficulty in recovering and sometimes exceeding the high amount invested. They are effects used for the rejuvenation of characters, the construction of scenarios from different eras and worlds, dozens of intergalactic beings from the most different backgrounds and visual effects of a scale and perfection rarely seen. Not for nothing, ""Ultimatum"" was nominated for an Oscar in the category. Few times have we seen so many characters gathered together, with several actions taking place simultaneously, and everything wonderfully orchestrated by the precise direction of the Russo brothers, who manage to maintain a perfect unity and synchrony. The final battle against Thanos that takes up almost the entire last hour of the three that lasts the film, will be remembered as one of the biggest and most spectacular in the history of cinema. There, we can see the full potential of all the heroes presented by the MCU in these years should be a delight for fans of the universe. Not to mention the emotional and beautifully post-battle scenes that tie up all the last loose ends of the Infinity Saga. The audience is in tears. And it is not a daydream or exaggeration.The soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, responsible for the famous Avengers theme, composed for the 2012 film, is once again perfect, elevating drama, melancholy and epic action to the tenth power. In the musical part, ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"", by Traffic, ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"", by The Kinks, ""Doom and Gloom"" by the Rolling Stones and ""Hey Lawdy Mama"", by Steppenwolf are some of the songs that are present. The production designer of the always competent Charles Wood and photography by Trent Opaloch, who uses and abuses the darkest filters that give the greatest degree of drama and pessimism that guide much of the feature film are used with mastery.Throughout the film, the Russo brothers think millimetrically about each scene, sometimes to make the audience cry, sometimes to laugh and sometimes to cheer for the heroes in their battles. As well as the conclusion of the saga ""Harry Potter"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"", the great megalomaniac of ""Ultimatum"" will remain in the minds of the moviegoers as one of those epic films that practically everyone has watched. And the end, still holds great surprises, some that envision a future of the Universe, such as those involving Thor and The Guardians of the Galaxy and the passing of Captain America's baton.""Ultimatum"" works above all expectations: it not only delivers a cathartic experience greater than Infinite Warfare, but it also establishes definitive positions regarding the MCU's destinies. The film proves to have been planned in detail by the studio's creative minds, who know more than anyone else, how to please their audience. Although ""Ultimatum"" seems to be the end of the Infinity Saga, phase 3 will officially end with ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"", which should still have consequences for this film in the life of Peter Parker, especially with the death of someone very close and dear to the hero.",positive
Just watched the new Avengers-movie. It's simply fantastic and a must-watch for every Marvel-Fan. It contains everything I expected and wished for an so much more. It's hard to put in words without a spoiler. Find out by yourself and enjoy.,positive
"A wonderful and amazing movie for all the fans.
So much emotions, so many nostalgic moments, and action, humor, drama! We get to see all the superheroes and some more loveable characters.
I feel sorry for those who try to find scientific logic in a movie about superheros. You really need to focus on what's important.
Just enjoy!",positive

"THE LOW-DOWN: Statistically, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has achieved a great deal: over 11 years and 21 films, it has introduced dozens of relatively obscure characters into mainstream pop culture. More importantly, however, the franchise has proven that long-form storytelling can work in a cinematic context - as long as you balance plot with heart and humour, prizing character development over spectacle. That's no small feat, and it's even more remarkable that a movie with the gargantuan scale and ambition of Avengers: Endgame doesn't fall apart beneath the weight of an unwieldy script or great expectations. In fact, this is the MCU's crowning achievement: a heartfelt love letter to the Avengers, their stories, the actors who play them, and to the fans.THE STORY: That damn Snap, eh? At the end of Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos wiped out half of the galaxy's population with a snap of his Infinity-Stone-enhanced fingers. After bearing witness to teammates and loved ones vanishing in swirls of dust and ash, the remaining Avengers struggle to live with the crippling grief and guilt of surviving the Snap... and of failing to prevent it. Some characters spiral into darkness; others are frozen in place - a few even manage to move on. But hope is rekindled when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) returns from the mysterious Quantum Realm, where the usual laws of physics, space and time do not apply...THE GREAT: Endgame is a storytelling triumph - not only does it bring together and pay off plots and ideas that were seeded over a decade ago, it builds solid, powerful, heartrendingly emotional narrative arcs for almost all of the original Avengers. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) must grapple with their pasts to figure out their futures, while Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) find themselves literally fighting to save their families. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) might provide much of the film's comic relief, but both characters are also gifted with grace notes, growth and moments of true peace.THE SUPER-GREAT: The ability to juggle and create space for multiple perspectives and storylines in one film has been honed to a fine art by directors Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. But their narrative strategy feels virtuosic in Endgame, paired as it is with an ingenious plot device that allows the film to truly acknowledge the staggering depth and breadth of its own history. Suddenly, the emotional and narrative stakes are raised, as beloved characters are forced to re-examine their lives, stories and priorities. You might find yourself in tears and in stitches, frequently in the same scene, and this happens throughout the film - a testament to the Russo Brothers' genius and their skills at anchoring even the most outlandish of storylines in humour and humanity.THE NOT-SO-GREAT: This is emphatically not a film for casual viewers - there is no entry point, no easing in, no exposition, to help you understand what the heck is going on if you haven't watched most of the preceding films in the MCU. There are also a few logical fallacies and plotholes scattered throughout Endgame that will puzzle you the more you think about them - from the wobbly rules governing time travel to the fractured way in which the too-conveniently hyper-powered Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) pops in and out of the story.STAN SERVICE: This film, above all others in the MCU, feels like a heartfelt tribute to the very concept of Marvel itself, finding numerous ways to reward and delight true-blue fans. Naturally, it includes Stan Lee's final appearance in the MCU, while folding in a host of other cameos and callbacks that reinforce the interconnectedness of the entire franchise - of all the stories that have been told before, especially the movie that started it all (Iron Man in 2008). There are even a couple of brilliant nods to comics lore, largely centred around the character of Captain America, that feel like the Russo Brothers are deliberately righting a few wrongs where some of Marvel Comics' more controversial plot twists are concerned. (See: Nick Spencer's run on Captain America: Steve Rogers.)CAST-IRON MVP: Casting outside of the box has always been one of the MCU's core strengths, with Oscar winners/nominees and character actors regularly popping up to play heroes and villains alike. That canny casting strategy pays off in spades in Endgame - especially when certain characters have relatively limited screen time but manage to make it count anyway. The undisputed stars of the movie, however, are the Avengers who started it all. Hemsworth continues to brilliantly dance along the knife-edge between comedy and pathos, while Ruffalo radiates charm and intelligence through ever-improving CGI as Banner and his not-so-mean, green alter ego: The Hulk. Johansson and Renner are given more to do in this film than ever before, and their combined efforts will shred your soul to pieces. Evans brings great warmth and strength to his stoic role, making it perfectly legitimate for you to weep and whoop for a man who's - somewhat ridiculously - wrapped in an American flag. Above all, this double-whammy of Avengers films belongs, most fittingly, to Downey Jr. He still effortlessly injects Tony with snark and swagger, but also beautifully conveys every shade and layer of his character's hard-won growth and maturity - giving us all the proof that we have never needed that Tony Stark has a heart.RECOMMENDED? In every imaginable way. Endgame sets the bar as high as it can possibly go for superhero epics that balance enormous scale and jaw-dropping ambition with actual substance and genuine emotion. It's the blockbuster movie event of our lifetimes, for very good reason - and it's worth every minute you've invested in the MCU since 2008.",positive
"This is my own opinion, but so many things that didn't make sense in that movie... like so much stuff that could've been utilised in a better way and so many stupid things that were put on wrong hands. The image and the graphics are really good but the plot is weak.

Graphics I give a 9/10

"This is probably one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the moment, with Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker (2019). The previous opus of the Avengers series, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), had left 'us' high and dry, in the depths of the abyss, while the latest episode of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain Marvel (2019), gave 'us' back a glimmer of hope.In short, I saw it in Paris this morning and I enjoyed it. It's an efficient blockbuster. The script and the manifold plot twists permanently keep the audience spellbound and breathless. This movie is one of the funniest and one of the most spectacular of the complete Marvel Cinematic Universe saga, not to mention an astonishing Computer-Generated Imagery, despite manifold script weaknesses that I will partially reveal below, within a dedicated post-script.Otherwise, a very unusual observation, at least within Paris: the audience has repeatedly applauded, at least 7/8 times, including the very beginning and the end of the movie, conveying an uncontrollable impatience, like a collective catharsis boosted to the extreme. And a female teen, about 17/18 years old, not far from me, cried. Literally! The audience was obviously made up of fans conquered beforehand... and that was part of the show!So Marvel, what's next? I am probably addicted and certainly impatient!As a post-script, a few remarks, annoyances or even irritations:1) First, a tiny spoiler as a favor. You will get absolutely nothing at the very end. Contrary to the Marvel habits and customs, there is no post-credit scene.2) The first half-hour is an immeasurable disappointment. While Thanos had, in the first opus, undertaken a Herculean task, a titanic challenge, a Homeric Odyssey in order to gather the 6 infinity stones and ""bring balance to the universe"" as a demiurge, in the second opus, he contents himself with a miserable and lonely life such as a peasant from the Middle Ages, because ""the stones served no purpose beyond temptation"". Wooooow! Literally incredible.3) Who understood this quote from Tony Stark to Steve Rogers? ""It's the EPR paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might have wound up pushing time through Lang"". Honestly, I do not know if we need an IQ above 250 or below 60 to understand this quote...4) During the manifold fights versus the Avengers, we do not really see the difference between Thanos with the 6 infinity stones and Thanos without: his power seems unchanged!5) Time travel exists fundamentally in two versions: a change in the past will or will not have an impact in the future. Even if the first category is the most representative with classics such as The Terminator (1984) or Back to the Future (1985), Avengers: Endgame (2019) clearly belongs to the second category.6) For their time heist, the Avengers break down into 3 separate teams to join 3 distinct time-spaces in which there are 3 Thanos. One Thanos in each space-time: New-York in 2012, Asgard in 2013, Morag+Vormir in 2014. During 60 minutes, we follow these 3 concomitant stories. The Thanos from 2014 discovers and understands the whole intrigue thanks to his daughter Nebula. Nevertheless, the Avengers are able to switch from one space-time to another one, thanks to a protective suit, a GPS bracelet and a capsule containing Pym particles. Thus, these three elements are specially designed by Tony Stark, with the posthumous help of Hank Pym, for such an expedition and are a priori mandatory for the way in and the way back. But we do not really know how, the Thanos from 2014 will go back in time with his faithful right-hand man Ebony Maw, the whole armada and a huge spaceship. Wooooow! Even alone, this time-travel should be impossible.7) For the time heist in Vormir, why Natacha Romanoff and Clint Barton have to go first through Morag, with James Rhodes and Nebula? The Avengers could have splitted the whole team in 4 instead of 3 from the start, right? So, why 3 teams instead of 4? Knowing that I see no reason for this detour via Morag, I think that the scriptwriters were desperately stuck and were looking for a way for the Thanos of 2014 to recover a free fast-pass, i.e. a protective suit + a GPS bracelet + a Pym capsule. Those of the mortal remains of Natacha Romanoff. Except that the Thanos of 2014 was absolutely not aware of the presence of this corpse on Vormir. In any way!8) The scriptwriters have combined two ultra-complex concepts, i.e. time travel and quantum realm, in order to optimally cheat the audience. Indeed, when Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are back in New-York, they are magically able to time-travel from New-York in 2012 to Camp Lehigh in 1970 without the help of any quantum tunnel device...9) .... and so on ... and so on ... The screenwriters had obviously bigger eyes than belly! In short, this is a typical pop corn movie: turn your brain off, and then, and then only, enjoy the show!10) At last, a two-penny question: where did they find inspiration for the hairstyles? A moronic soccer player for Clint Barton, undoubtedly. Without forgetting Carol Danvers, or how to disfigure a sex bomb with a pair of scissors?That's all, folks!",positive
"Wow, just Wow! This movie has it all and needs to be watched PERIOD!!",positive
Overlong and cheesy in the extreme. As a massive Avengers fan I was disappointed in the film. Who on earth decided to portray Thor as an overweight bloated drunkard?..That person should be hit with Thor's hammer. In a way I am glad that it has come to an end. It had become a money making machine at the expense of high octane adventure. Yes I will miss it but maybe not as much as I should!!!,positive
"I'd give this movie a 6/10 at best - it's a mindless action movie trying to be more and people seeing it as more.There's amazing CGI, and when you throw in countless superheros any cliche makes your ""hair stand up"". But for me, this entire film revolved around one-liner comedy in place of character development, and what it's known for best... mindless action.The action doesn't even have to make sense, like Thanos magically 1v5'ing with no infinity stones when in the previous film had issues 1v1'ing with stones. The entire movie is ""hype"" revolving around a ridiculous time ""heist"". They even made jokes about how stupid the idea is, and in 30 seconds Iron Man figures it out.This entire movies is cliches, re-used tropes, and one-liners used by familiar actors and amazing CGI. If that's all it takes to be great, good for you!",negative
"To say this movie was awesome is an understatement. I'm still processing everything but OMG was it truly a masterpiece. I'm struggling to think if I've ever given a 10 before, but if I have it's only ever been one or two in my life.
This certainly was a 10... However you definitely need to see ALL the movies from 2008's Iron Man through Infinity war. And I do mean ALL of them for this movie to truly shine or even to make sense. Even given the 3 hour running time this movie makes no attempts to fill you in, and nor should it. You need to be well prepared going into thisThat said I saw the opening night fan event showing, and got a commemorative coin that is actually metal, heavy, and super cool! But it was shown in a regular theater with mediocre sound, so I also have tickets for a showing on Friday as well in a Dolby theater room, which I can't wait to see. Now I loved Avengers Infinity War, but I laughed, cheered and got way more emotional in this movie than that one. I've been in theaters where the crowd cheered or laughed before, but I don't think I've ever seen it let alone experienced it to this degree. The emotions were just flowing to say the least.I really liked how the first act brought you into the aftermath of this post-snap world, and really focused on the hardship of what things would have been like after such an event. And while this was all very sad the one thing I was shocked about was that they successfully pulled off so much humor. Humor in a marvel movie is no surprise, but given how Infinity War ended I really thought this was going to be a dark and dreary movie, and yet it gave me some of the best laughs while still taking itself serious. It's quite a magic act to pull offThe second act really sets the game plan in motion for how they plan to ""fix"" things and while suspenseful and intriguing it still kept up great and appropriate humor. Obviously humor is a subjective thing and some might bash it. I tend not to like potty humor style but more organic or situational humor, which I thought they just nailed. But at the same time there were some heartache moments that just brought you on the edge of your seat, or made you wipe your eyes. Towards the middle of the movie I was just glued to my seatAnd then there's the third act. OMG... As you would expect it sets up a mega finish as they really are wrapping up the culmination of 11 years and 20+ films worth of story lines and this is what it's all about. The action was great, effects second to none, a bit chaotic at times but that just adds to the intensity. There were moments I just yelled and cheered like I never have at a movie before. I watched it with my daughter who I've taken to or seen every one of the marvel movies with and we were clenching each other through the last 15-20 minutes as it was just so intense, amazing and emotional.Coming out of the movie we were both just stunned and in awe, just trying to process the emotions of what we just saw. To bring out so much emotion in us, and from what we saw so many others is just unbelievable. That in itself just tells you how extraordinary this movie was and is a true credit to everyone involved in making this film. All I can say is don't read any spoilers as there are sure to be some now that it's out. Get some tickets, go and see it for yourself, you will not regret it, but again if you've missed any of the movies in between Iron Man and Infinity war, get caught up first.",positive
"Best movie of the decade. As far as what it achieved and it's impact. Just like Avatar 2009 was the movie of the decade, this movie is too. Now sure it's not a 10/10 it's close though. For a movie that has so much background behind it, obstacles to achieve and a movie before it that was arguably one of the greatest last year, this movie had HUGE expectations... and it sure enough delivered... the box office tells you it all. #1 most money made from a film finally beating avatar... this is a beautiful way to close out this decade off to 2020. And DC has a win up their sleeve as well. Having Joker become the first R rated film to surpass 1 billion. They're both swinging strong this year. Good job marvel I see you, im more of a DC fan myself but I want to see them both succeed and this film deserves its 10/10 I was crying twice and laughing more and engaged.",positive

"Part four of this gigantic Avengers saga cannot really be evaluated alone. It is directly related to part three. You can put them together like two pieces of a puzzle. In my opinion, both together are much better than parts 1 and 2.I'm excited. From the end of Part 3 at the latest, I was completely in the Avengers Universe. The action, the drama. Everything at a very high level, despite the many characters and superheroes. But the special thing about the Avengers is that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are not afraid to break taboos. In part four it is tough and it rarely gets cheesy or boring. Despite the very long three-hour runtime. In addition to all the superhero films, some of which dissolve into insignificance, Avengers looks like a little masterpiece.",positive
"This film is not as good as many of the other Marvel movies (and certainly not the 'great' film reviewers are saying it is). It started off VERY slowly / took a while to get going. HATED what they did with Thor's character - making him a fat, lazy drunk. And I really think they should have killed off Hawkeye (who had become almost unlikable / a complete psychopath0 as opposed to Black Widow (who is a fan favorite). There were also a lot of inconsistencies with regards to bringing people back from the dead - they were brought back 5 years later, but they had not aged (while everyone else around them did age). Yet somehow, Peter Parker is still going to high school with all of the same high school friends who have miraculously NOT aged (unless they had all been deleted by Thanos, I find this highly unlikely). Captain Marvel, while very cool, was made to be too powerful. They also waited far too long to bring everyone back - not until the very end of the movie. So while it was 'enjoyable' (end fight scene was fantastic), there were many things that could have been done better.",positive

"Do you remember your least favourite episodes from the Star Trek series?
You know the ones I'm talking about. They involve time travel.
Yup, when you have no idea how to fix the writing mess you've made, reach into your bag of hacks and pull out time travel.
So too have the writers of the latest Marvel film.
Worse yet, it's a mirror image of the previous Marvel Avengers film. Only this time, we have the heroes digging around in the past tracking down all the stones (as opposed to Thanos doing it) and a giant pointless CGI fight at the end (just like the last time around.)I couldn't figure out how the film was 3 hours long, until they started getting the stones, each section is played out seemingly just to pad the runtime. When the Hulk puts on the Iron-Man created infinity glove and snaps his fingers to bring everyone back, all the returned folks take it quite well, just a quip and a node of ""oh, we were dead, and now we're back? That's fine.""This film glosses over so many more interesting aspects of the plot in a rush to get to the CGI fest that is the end.Sure, the film will make billions from all the fans (and let's face it, this is for the fans only) but it doesn't deserve to. It's a hackneyed mess.",negative

"As of now, after about 100K reviews the average user rating for Avengers: Endgame sits at 9.2. Infinity War, after about 620K, has an 8.5. I like where this assessment stands and hope it doesn't change much, as more user ratings flood in.I point this out for all the negative reviews citing how Infinity War was far superior to Endgame and that Endgame was such garbage and flawed. This is without a doubt a case of the criticisms saying much more about the critic than what they are saying about the film. Perhaps their own disposition and attitudes prevent them from a positive perception. They are certainly entitled to their pretentiousness and to feel cheated, but their petulance is their OWN responsibility. Much to the chagrin of this minority, the majority has not only embraced what Endgame is, but for the time being placed it above Infinity War.I say this because I tire of the arrogance and contempt in people that behave as though they could have written or produced a better result than what they paid to see. Many of those that love to review or critique, think it en vogue or trendy to be incredulous, negative, or never be satisfied.I'm happy to see that the majority of viewers were satisfied and more than content with Avengers: Endgame. IMO, complaining and rating the film sub par requires a great amount of cynicism and disenchantment. IMO, if you allow plot holes or whatever other discrepancies found in the film, to ruin it or leave you sour and disappointed, then you probably tend to create your own misery in life in life anyway.There's nothing wrong with having a personal opinion or particular disposition. I do however think it important to put disillusionment and negativity in its proper place, to achieve objective perspective. So again, according to imdb user review, Infinity War is at 8.5 and Endgame is at 9.2 and holding. I'll check back on the consensus in a few months after further reviews.",positive
"Basically the title. Left me speechless. I was probably too hyped to the point of annoyance but it broke my massive expectations to the point that I'm watching it again 2 more times this weekend.

The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some.",positive

"""Avengers: Endgame"" is probably the biggest cinematic event of the twenty-first century. It's hard to describe what it was like seeing this movie in the first few weeks when it came out, people were going nuts over this. When it came out, I personally didn't like it as much as ""Infinity War"", but upon rewatching, I actually like it better and I personally think it's one of the best Marvel films.First off, the story goes in a completely different direction than I had thought it was going to go. By the half hour mark, we're introduced to a really fun time travel plot. Then it concludes with an epic final battle. Personally, I thought that the ending was really nice and it was a good sendoff to the first generation of MCU heroes. In hindsight, knowing where the series has gone in the past few years since this movie, I kind of wish that it had just ended here and there weren't movies like ""Black Widow"" and ""Multiverse of Madness"" that changed a lot of these characters.Although I said that I liked the final battle, I will also say that it came off a little bit rushed. Like it's basically the exact same ending battle that we got in the previous movie.Definitely watch this, if you're one of the five people that hasn't already. Definitely one of the best superhero movies of all time, a huge entertainment spectacle with great special effects and a heroic triumph.",positive
"Though it has been repeated time and time again, it is still quite insane to think about an end to 11 years and 22 movies. A cinematic universe that for quite a few of us, we have grown up with. A universe that despite all the bad that may have gone on in one's life or in the world, we could always look forward to one day out of the year where we could escape that and enjoy 2 hours of watching our childhood heroes kick butt on the silver screen. A cinematic universe, that I quite frankly thought was impossible to successfully conclude, until the Russo Brothers proved me wrong.
Any way you slice it, Avengers Endgame should go down as one of the toughest movies to write. Bringing a true and satisfying ending to 11 years of stories in a universe where the death is never truly accepted, the cast size seems never-ending, and an overabundance of story arcs could drive any writer insane should prove a near impossible task. Yet here we are as smart, conscious decisions are made throughout the movie. The reduced team size allows for a focus both character and story wise that makes it a movie easy to follow (for the most part) despite still being among the most ambitious Marvel movies. Surprise callbacks and fan-service moments act like a Greatest Hits album giving fans a true appreciation for the greatness of the Infinity Saga. Despite the temptation to just rely on these callbacks, where the film truly shines like any other Marvel movie is with its characters. Through the course of the 4,5, and 6 movies the Original Six Avengers have appeared in, several decisions have been made that not only affected each character but changed their overall perspectives. The Russo Brothers dedication to these characters is seen in the masterfully crafted scenes that continue or conclude the appropriate arcs. All while still producing shots, scenes, and moments that created the best cinematic experience I have ever had. To put it simply, for 3 hours I simply got to be a 10-year-old cheering, laughing, and crying with the heroes that I have grown up with, idolized, and loved for my whole life. For that I thank the entire Marvel family!",positive
"The finale of the lengthy series featuring a constellation of Marvel's luminaries, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a watchable superhero flick that merges real life interactions and explosive fantasy. Featuring A-List stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk and Black Widow respectively the film finds our heroes in the eternal tale of the battle between good and evil and some stones. Decent acting with simple but adequate special effects help carry the view. The biggest snag of the whole enterprise is its length. Clocking in at three hours the span strains an already shaky script and the mature viewer's patience. Perhaps I've long outgrown Fantasy movies and seeing full grown men and women in skimpy outfits playing cartoon characters challenged belief and the overall silliness of it can't be shaken off. Maybe it's not just me; the bored, going through the motions look of the actors especially at the start of the film seems to mirror this. The thought of having to wear those tight stretchy outfits for the umpteenth time and having to memorize and utter those prepubescent lines were too much despite the hefty paycheck. A massive hit despite all of that, I still remember the loooooong lines in the cinemas to watch this and I guess the masses are basically dorks who'll embrace fantasies on the big screen to forget themselves and their lives. This is one to burn time with the kiddos and make you appreciate your soda and popcorn more.",positive
"Good movie. A good ending to a great saga Loved the acting and direction was superb but the length of the movie was tediously long. the movie fails to keep the tempo. The character arch of some were strangely distorted. overall a great movie. loved the ending. Tony Stark, Captain America, thor, Hulk, Black widow and Hawkeye will always remain in our hearts.",positive
"...and pull the hype train over.
Amazing fun, stunning spectacle great performances especially RDJ.
It's just not the whole sum of its parts.
Lots of great parts but not cohesively held.
Too much Comedy with one character essentially now just full comedy relief.
The most ridiculous coincidences and a couple of plot holes.
You will laugh, you will get gut punched and for some you will cry, but then you will wonder what really happened in that 3 hours.
Did it need 3 hours? No.
Is it better than infinity war? No.
Will you enjoy it? Definitely.",positive
First 30 minutes everyone is moping around couldn't hang around for another 2 & a half hours to see overpaid morons do senseless acts. I am ashamed to contribute towards this movie's box office record.PS: I am not a dumb merican who likes stupid action without a story. Disney has ruined movies no one will make quality movies anymore just idiotic superhero stuff.,negative
"NO SPOILERS
First off, the timeline in this movie is flawless. The absolute best, most coherent and consistent time travel use in any movie. The complaints in these reviews completely misunderstood how it worked.Second, the other complaint is Thor. Was he weaker? Yeah. Was I disappointed? Yeah, but it follows the progression of his character. He lost his whole family, swore revenge, almost saved the day and missed it by a foot. His demise into self loathing makes perfect sense and allows other characters to shine in battles. Thor tends to be overpowered so this leveled the playing field.Third, the pacing is slow and ponderous. But it asks you to follow the characters and their emotions and reactions to the snap. The slow pace allows the characterization to shine and not be overblown by tedious fighting like some scenes in Infinity War.Overall, I don't get people's desire for overpowered characters with aimless action scenes. Endgame does a great job creating small moments for personality and giving everyone a chance to shine in battle.",positive
"Endgame does have a few minor plot holes, but overall, it is an incredible culmination of the MCU. I was terribly afraid they were going to easily reset all of the damage done in Infinity War, but that was not the case here. This film revisited many of the past installments via the time traveling aspect. I thought this was going to be terrible but they honestly did it very well. The whole MCU is tied together quite well. We are also treated with some meaningful and sacrificial character deaths that will likely be permanent. The final battle is a true masterpiece and honestly made me tear up a little bit (I am not one to cry). When Cap lifts and wields Mjolnir, I wanted to stand up and cheer. Truly an incredible scene. We also finally get to see Thanos full combat ability without the boost of the Infinity Gauntlet which is a nice treat.
Now, there are a couple issues here. First of all, Captain Marvel is off doing who knows what while the rest of the Avengers are fighting for the survival of the universe. What could she possibly be doing that is more important? She finally shows up at the end out of nowhere, similar to her entire existence in this universe. Honestly, they should've saved her for the next phase. She is too powerful a character to throw in at the end of all this with minimal development.I also disliked how the heroes' base is utterly annihilated by Thanos' ship with all of them in it. I understand those like Thor, Cap, Hulk, and Iron Man surviving, but Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Rocket are totally unharmed? A little unrealistic even in this universe.All that said, I absolutely loved this film and really couldn't be happier with this conclusion. Yes, they could've worked out a couple bumps in the plot, but hey, no movie is perfect.",positive
"I'm big fan of marvel, and I see all movie comics books and this is a best movie in the world not only comics , in all movies.",positive

"Walt Disney Pictures most anticipated movie of the year did not disappoint. Without spoiling the movie too much, this Marvel Studios film directed by the Russo Brothers was nearly a cinematic masterpiece. However, there were a few things that that drop it a level or two from being 10 out of a 10. The main one is the overuse of story convenience & plot armor. There is way too many Deux Ex Machina moments in the redemption journey of the Avengers team figuring out, how to undo the effects of Thanos' (Motion Capture & Voice Acting by Josh Brolin) actions from the last movie 2018 'Infinity War' that really took me out of the story. One of them is the whole rescue of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) in outer space. It was not needed as most of the media trailers already spoil that Stark was able to make it back to Earth. Not only that, but it was a bit jarring & little too hard to believe that Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) was able to find a small ship in the vast cosmos. That scene didn't really belong in the movie. The film could have used that time to explore the depths of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) depression and trauma. It was a bit much to see the God of Thunder reduce into an over the top comedy relief character. The writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely should have treat his extreme lost in a nuanced and meaningful way. They could had cut back a little bit on the laughs involving him. As for the other sequences of the Avengers dealing with their post snap despair. It was fine for the most part, even if it's a bit slow. I just wish the world that they live in, should had been more chaotic & apocalyptic dystopia. Nevertheless, clocking in at three hours and one minute runtime, this twenty-second film entry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was already a very long watch. It really needed better pacing. It had too many 1989 'Back to the Future Part 2"" time travel type scenarios & recycled footage callbacks. Some of them, are not that interesting, such as the Asgard trip. Those scenes could had been more compelling, if the setting were changed to them going to the Collector's hideout in Knowhere during the events of 2014's 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. Plus, the story would had been more compact as the Power & Reality Stones were at the same place. Nevertheless, others time travel moments like the one in the 1970s were not really needed, when you think about it. Don't get me wrong, it was a very emotional moment for Tony Stark to meet his dad, but, much of that time, could had been used to establish tears for other characters, such as the tragic love story between Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) & Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson). Natasha kinda got the short straw here. After all, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Widow's skills in stealth and deception would have been better suited with any other mission. The superhuman demigods should had explore Vormir. Nevertheless, the time travelling sequences were highly entertaining. I just wish they focus a little more on establishing the David Deutsch rules how it honestly works, because where it stands. It's highly complicated & confusing. There is a lot of inconsistencies & contradictions that really stands out. Most of them, involves past versions of characters coming to the prime timeline future, & Captain America (Chris Evans) actions toward the end. Even Ant Man (Paul Rudd) being able to use endless amount of Pym particles is somewhat not coherent. I hate that the writers brush those unanswered plot holes off, because I really curious, on how Steve Rogers honestly return those stones back in their time periods without screwing up time even worst or getting caught. Those unseen moments could had been really interesting action scenes. Regardless, the ones we do witness, were fine, even if they were CGI heavy. There is just a few nitpicks. The Sanctuary II ship opens fire point-blank with all its cannons on the Avengers base until it's nothing but a smoldering crater but it doesn't even manage to injure, never mind kill, any of the people inside is really hard to believe. Those who do die, are somewhat predictable. Also, Carol Danvers's big rescue in the end, really does make the character, nothing more than a dull shrew, walking Deux ex Machina. To make it worst, there was a very phony put in political progressive movement message in Endgame's climax that pays tribute to the women of Marvel that really doesn't fit. It seem awkwardly push as fan service rather than fitting within the logistic of that scene. While, the movie does jump around, a lot; nearly every scene was a very heart pounding experience built on fine heroic. The goods outweigh the bad. Surprisingly, the movie gave, enough screen time to, nearly all the marvel characters, without, turning into a giant mess of a film. Nearly every performer, including the cameos in this movie did a great job. As for the humor, it was fine. Lots of hilarious moments for a surprisingly dark film. The music score by composer Alan Silvestri is beautiful to listen to. In the end, it will be very interesting to see what dangers, a universe without the infinity stones will bring. Hopefully the new crop of heroes can indeed stop them. Can't wait for Phrase 4. Until then, this entry in the MCU is worth repeat viewings. It's highly recommended. This movie entertain us with enough to overlook all the flaws. It's really is, a must watch. It's marvelous.",positive
"Wow , first time to stay 3 hours long in the cinema . It's quite an experience in IMAX with laser . Movie is alright , just like what i expected . But 50 USD worth ticket per one is insane !",positive
"Infinity war was overall a better movie, but this movie had the disadvantage of being the follow up to that movie. A good chunk of this movie is essentially remembering what happened during infinity war. The struggle against Thanos in this movie... It just isnt done in a satisfying way.Before Infinity war came out last year, it was already confirmed there would be another Avengers follow up this year. It was speculated that Endgame was actually going to be called ""Infinity war part 2"". Unfortunately, this is Endgame, but it SHOULD have been Infinity war part 2. I know that is very vague, Im trying to be vague, but essentially because of what happened in Infinity War, it was pretty much impossible to make a sequel which feels like it even is the same story with the same consistency & epic feel. Or at least, that is not what we got.Captain Marvel kinda sucks in this movie. She is a boring character with magic powers. Ughhh great. In hindsight, the tease in Infinity war was cool, but it makes it into a big letdown. And this is kind of the story of the whole movie, if Infinity War was the teaser. (Although it isnt quite that bad, this movie is still pretty good, unlike Captain Marvel in it.)",positive
"There is more to story than action scenes. The movie was great, not as good as Infinity War but not terrible as people are making out. I understand the critisism but people rating below a 5 are clearly fan based blind.",positive

2- Unrealistic overpowered Thanos without the gems... illogical AF.
3- Characters decisions specially in Thanos combat were dump and had no logic.

5- Too much forced drama and fillers.

"I didn't think this could surpass Infinity War but the Russo Brothers did it.
Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame managed to do it. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and I'll go so far as to say, maybe even the absolute pinnacle of the Marvel franchise. It's both hilarious and emotionally engaging (there were people crying at my theatre including me). And while it's a lot more character focused than Infinity War, as it should be considering this is the final hurrah for many of the original Avengers, that doesn't mean it's lacking In terms of visuals. The film is an absolute spectacle to behold, it easily tops Infinity War's action sequences in my opinion and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated.10/10 best Marvel movie in my opinion. It's honestly hard for me to see how they'll ever be able to top this one.",positive

"Endgame turned out to be a good one time watch but fell a bit short of my expectations. Go in with low expectations and you might think differently. What follows next in this article is a bunch a questions I had and a ton of spoilers which go with them. Along with those are some of those goosebumps worthy moments in the movie and a small review as well. So read along only if you don't mind the spoilers.How did Hawkeye end up with the Soul stone? Nat killed herself and she is definitely not one that Hawkeye loved the most. I thought you need to sacrifice that you loved the most to get the Soul stone ?
The Time Travel sequence did mess up my brain. The second snap is supposed to have put things back to prior to when the first snap took place for the people who perished in the snap. It now meant that 50% of the population has lived all the way from 2018 to 2023 while the remaining 50 percent of the population is probably just waking up in 2023, seconds after they went into a nap in 2018. Mixed timelines for everyone. Spiderman Far from home is going to be interesting in this aspect unless every character from part 1 were snapped to dust only to return, unaged in 2023.
Loki from 2012 took off with the Tesseract and this should have some real huge ramifications in the current day timeline including the events of Thor 2, Ragnarok and even Infinity Wars. Remember, this was still the time when Loki was still the bad guy and could have had serious impact in the whole timeline of any story that happened afterwards and did he survive the events of the Infinity war due to this new timeline ?
I am still not able to wrap around the fact that they found it okay to go back and change the timeline for saving half the population but found it okay that certain few individuals could be sacrificed in the process when time-travel was still a possibility. The availability of Pym particles should not really be a criteria as there definitely should be somebody who could have ended up developing something that was discovered in 1970's. If you time travel once and do end up creating those alternate timelines, you should definitely be okay to do it again to save someone else you lost in a previous timeline. Marvel jumped right into the time travel mess that 20th Century had with X-Men.
Now about Mjolnir. Why on earth did the out-of-shape lazy Thor bring it back from the 2013 Asgard or did Cap return it while returning the stone. After all the things done to alter the past what prevented Thor from telling his mother what the battle of Maliketh meant to her future? That was something Thor should have let out considering the fact that the whole movie treated Thor like an idiot (I repeat, not one with sense of humor but one who is an idiot).
Where did vision go ? He should have been part of the last scene right or was it because the snap happened after Vision died?
What about Cap's splintered timeline? He effectively had a different life post the events of 2023 in the 1970's as a superhero and ended up taking no part in any of the events of the previous Marvel movies ? That would make him a superhero who couldn't care any less about 'bad' events that were supposed to happen and he could have prevented.
Now, to the event that I could not wrap my head around even a wee bit. Thanos from 2014 went to 2023 (present) to get dusted himself by the Avengers. So essentially he dies even before he got hold of even a single Infinity stone. That pretty much wipes out almost 90 percent of all the bad things that happened in the past few Marvel movies. Does it not essentially mean that other than Tony and Nat the rest of the world survived as they never had Thanos to deal with in the first place?
Doctor Strange and his pals does this space travel thing through the circle of fire thing (for lack of better words) to get all the Avengers to the right spot, even from far away planets with a blink of an eye. Why on earth didn't he do the same during the course of the other movies (especially Infinity war) when they could have really done with some space travel to get to where the action was? Is it some sort of skill that pops up only when there needs to be no explanation provided?There should be a lot more that I missed as the movie as such has too much going on in too less of a timespan and yet it felt like some of the scenes could have been avoided. The movie itself started off brilliantly with an emotional tone and the mood pretty much remains the same throughout. If I were to select one character that had the movie gave justice to the most, it has to be Cap, even though Tony had a better sent off and if I were to select one character that was absolutely marginalized and made useless, it has to be Thor with a whopping margin.Thanos has to be one of the most wholesome villains ever in Movie history. His goals are not mired by emotion. He has absolute faith in himself and he genuinely believes in the result of his actions. How a 'stone-less' Thanos was still stronger than most of the Avengers combined was something I could not wrap my head around. This could have been one of the reasons why they kept Thor fat and Captain Marvel far away from action to bring some parity to the proceedings.Now to some of those goosebumps worthy scenes, most of them involved Cap (not a Cap fan here!)Avengers Assemble !
'I can do this whole day'. 'Yeah, yeah, I know'
'Hail Hydra'
'I went for the head'
'I knew it'
Cap using Mjolnir
It's definitely a fitting swansong for some of the characters in the Universe but I probably expected more from the movie. Definitely worth a watch.",positive
"Here it is then, after eleven years and twenty one movies of differing quality, we finally reach the Endgame.But does it deliver?Does it really live up to Infinity Wars sombre ending?Yes, my goodness yes, and despite my expectations being stupendously high on the verge of me thinking that I would not enjoy it, it's easily one of the most satisfying cinema experiences that I have ever experienced.The trailer would lead you to believe that this film would be emotionally draining, the most serious of the MCU, but there is as much humour in this than any of the other phase entries, and they are genuine laugh out loud moments.But the humour does not pull the viewer away from the emotional pull that the characters pour on to the screen, and with every laugh out loud moment, there are some gut punches the film gives that will leave you reeling, if you've been even semi-invested in this behemoth of a cinematic universe.At just over three hours, Endgame truly does not feel like that, and throws some wonderful curve-balls for almost every main character, and Kudos to the Russo Brothers, they give each character a goal, an ambition, that makes you care all the more for their quest.The main meat of the film is the strained relationship between Stark and Rogers, reluctance, denial, guilt, anguish, and anger all play a part when they are together on screen.The second act is the foundation of the film, it's genius, almost jaw-dropping in the fact that it shouldn't make sense, it could easily fail, but the writers have so much respect for the franchise, and filmgoers, that it works so effortlessly.To say a lot about the third act would to give too much away, but viewers will not be disappointed. It delivers on a grandiose scale, almost delusional, but its awe-inspiring stuff.You know not to read any spoilers, and unfortunately they are so easy to find, but everyone knows not to.But rest assured, it left me stunned, satisfied and teary eyed.Marvel have done something epic, and there will not be a film like this around for a very long time.",positive
"Thematically, Endgame has it all. Without question the best superhero action sequences and moments across all of the MCU movies to date. However, the story isn't as tight as IW, mainly due to the fact that the plot relies heavily on the obviousness of time travel and random conveniences.The story tries hard to pull on your emotions but, you know how it is, a random joke would be shoehorned at the worse time ever. The time travel was kind of a cop out and in Endgame is treated very tongue-in-cheek with the various references of other time travel movies in popular culture. It obvious that the only way the characters even had a shot at getting everyone back, that they'll use time travel as a means to do it.I was expecting something a lot more subtle, like an actual mission to uncover the stones by some other impossible means.The stone heist plot felt specifically tailored to each character like a story outline for an RPG tabletop game other than a coherent choice. Each of these characters knew that the power stone carried their own inherited risk and that the Soul Stone was perhaps the most deadliest of all to obtain.The ending was great, if not a bit expected. But by all means, the movie is great besides a few hundred plot holes.The number one pain in my backside is the fact that NONE of this would have been possible were it not for a freakin' RAT!Dr. Strange's prediction of 1 in 14 million came into existence due to the simple actions of a mindless rat! I dont know about you guys, but it felt like some sick joke that kinda deluded the whole story in that sense. Kinda disrespectful to not only the hardwork put into these movies but to the fandom watching them as well.That's just my opinion on the matter, but still.",positive
"I loved Infinity War so was counting down the days until this opened. After that Amazing set up in the first film, I don't like some of the decisions the writers made for this movie and it suffers because of them.
Fat Thor and Professor Hulk don't work here and the time travel slows the pace down of the overall story. Also, Captain Marvel disappearing for the entire movie defeats the impact of her even being in the movie. I loved the end battle, the performances and death hits you in the gut. This is not a bad film , I just think it could have been great like Infinity War.",positive
"Best marvel film to come out to this date. It is extraordinary, mind boggling, you will definitely get lots of goosebumps. 10/10 for sure. The culmination of the last 11 years of Marvel movies has lead to this epic conclusion of the pinnacle of the infinity saga. The movie defied all odds and absolutely crushed it out of the park. Brimmed with emotions and swashbuckling fiesta. Avengers: Endgame delivers.",positive
"First, I am a HUGE Infinity Wars fan.. I even collected expansive statues re-enacting the epic battle in my shelves (after winning infinity style war with my wife of course).As predicted, the Director made the end sappy enough for some to shed tears. I was shedding tears myself on the account I would never make the insane amount of money the actors (main casts) did. The first two hour was a total drag, it was as if the Director owes 3 hours to the audience or maybe in a more sinister manner they believe epic movie should run at least 3 hours (Hence... 3 hours 1 minute including credits).My major concern was the TIME TRAVELING plot which disregarded paradoxical continuity. Again, I am not a hater. I just found it highly inefficient if not plain stupid to have the remaining Avengers to go back in different TIMEs and PLACEs to collect each individual stone (the SOUL stone requires SACRIFICE!... duh). Would it be easier if they just went BACK in TIME (along with Captain Marvel this time) to the planet where Iron Man & friends battled Thanos and stripped him off the gauntlet which was already full of stones? If they did this, there wouldn't be any needs of casualty. Vision would be spared. Scarlet witch wouldn't need to be as traumatic then.Well, TIME HEIST damage has been done, but AGAIN:
1. Why didn't the future Nebula died instantly when she killed her PAST self? Violation for the Grandpa Paradox. Or, as it turned out, JC wasn't the only one to get resurrected afterall.2. Why on earth did Iron Man have to conjure the gauntlet onto himself while risking DEATH? Why can't he instead put the gauntlet on Captain Marvel or HULK (who did it once and survived) or Thor and let them SNAP the hell of it? They were sorta IMMORTALS member of the Avengers with strength that most likely will withstand the impact anyway. But no, Stark had to get the end credit.3. What made the snapping of the Gauntlet by the Hero result in different way from Tanos? What if when Iron Man flicked it, the result was also the annihilation of half the population? Too risky a think. I liked War Machine's idea of going back in time and strangled baby Thanos instead.4. Finally, LOKI should've been brought to LIFE as the TIME TRAVELling thing would cancel out the event in which LOKI was killed by Thanos. I felt like this was an anticlimax to the flawless Infinity Wars... sorry Stan. If you want a better time traveling movie, go see ""Back to the future"" or even ""Hot-tub time machine"".. and ""Bill and Ted's excellent Adventure""",positive
All over the place & all in all very dissapointing - even some of marvel characters have morphed into embarrassing caricatures. Is it the writers fault or have some of the actors got a bit too much influence? ..... I don't get what planet anyone who gives thos film 5/10 is living on let alone all the 9/10 and 10/10 rating ... The mind boggles ....,negative

The set up for this was perfect, the build up to this was perfect, and the pay off was perfect. Avengers: Endgame is done flawlessly and perfectly.",positive
"It was always going to be a challenge to create a movie that neatly ties up a decade of continuity and juggles a cast of characters built up over 22 films and the fear was that End Game was going to be anticlimactic.
Fans do not fear, the Russo's have crafted a near perfect film from its heart wrenching opening to its close. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll weep and you'll leave the cinema pretty happy with the experience.
If you are new to the Marvel Universe then this is not for you and will appear to be a jumbled mess of a film but for anyone who has been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Iron Man back in 2008 this is everything you wanted to see.",positive

But Infinity War introduced Thanos - finally a villain worthy of my interest. The movie was a 10/10.Now, Endgame, this was an excellent movie. Despite not being a superheroes nerd, I truly enjoyed this film and thought it was made expertly. How the hel* did this not get a lot of Oscar nominations and some Oscar wins? How the hel* did Parasite win best picture, director, and why did Endgame not even get nominated for best cinematography and special effects? Crazy.Conclusion: amazing film. It was perfect. The final battle was of epic apocalyptic proportions.",positive
"I thought Avengers: Endgame was a really well put together movie. I can't imagine its easy to coordinate 20 something movies into one big finale but they pulled it off well. I think the whole time travel plot line was something everyone knew was coming, but they worked it really well. I think there are a few loose ends that they left on purpose. The ending scene was completely for the fanbase and I really enjoyed it. Overall, I think Infinity War had a better plotline but Endgame definitely had a more fun, loose feel to it.",positive
A perfect way to end the avengers saga. This movie will have you feeling all your emotions. Totally worth the 10 years of movies and the 3 hour play screen,positive
"I really like this movie, I found a good plot and also a good final, yeah the people cry and more, but it is a serious movie with several elements which honored to its fans, It is indeed a super hero movie that will live in th mind of many fans",positive
"This felt like a big feeding to all the normie crap invading Marvel in the last years combined with some Deus Ex Machina. Felt more like a comedy movie and silly scientific experiments than anything else. Thor was funny but ridiculous, Hawkeye has a major role ??? The Hulk was ""cool"" but it felt like there was no Hulk at all. Again...Marvel serving the ""regulars"".
Movie was fun, there were some good bits like Cap vs Thanos but as a whole it's pretty much forgettable. I would say ""go see it"" but it's NOT a can't miss!",positive
"Maybe because Infinity ended the way it did which was epic and it was such a step up from anything else, Endgame was never going to be able to top that. Everyone knows going in who's going to win in the end but how they got there was a job well done. Some real surprises especially with Thor but I was truly gutted with the Hulk. I don't know if that was taken from the comics but the Hulk is the Hulk right, the angry uncontainable green monster from Avengers Assemble. This was Hulk-light. Boring Hulk. What a waste. He wouldn't come out to play in Infinity and then the next time he's like the Beast from X-Men! Strange decision for me.
This was easily the most emotional of the films as I teared up a couple of times which hardly happens to me and I guess I'm actually sad that it's the end of an era. So to sum up, excellent and the love and effort put into the film is obvious for any to see. The Hulk will always be a thorn though whenever I watch this movie again.",positive
"***Warning...possible spoilers***
This movie was fine, but it was not great. It did a somewhat satisfactory job of bringing together all of the previous MCU movies...certainly no easy task. However, there was very little action, most of the jokes fell flat, and the emotional scenes didn't reverberate. Also, there were just too many obvious plot holes, both within the whole time-travel theme and in general. It just wasn't a great story or a great job of storytelling. I'll admit that I'm not an emotional person, but anyone who said they cried (especially some of the critics who said they cried, cried, laughed, cried, cheered, and cried some more) has never seen an actual well-made movie with a great story. I didn't cry at the end of Infinity War, and I certainly didn't get even the slightest bit emotional in Endgame. I also saw critics who said everyone stood and cheered when it was over. I definitely didn't experience that. Our theater just sat pretty quietly with quite a few conversations about the gaping plot holes. Again, not a bad movie, but it certainly didn't live up to what I was hoping for.",positive
"Whaaaat? Time travel? Really? No way I saw 'this' coming... Except, I did. Oh no, Ironman and Black Widow are dead. Boohoo! Except nobody ever DIES in these movies (like the Red Skull-cough cough). They'll be brought back by some sort cloning technology or with some weird voodoo magic (...or time travel). It worked for Deadpool after all. The avengers literally couldn't go on any further. I mean the violence kind of escalated when they destroyed a city, then a small country, then a planet and finally the entire universe! You can't trump that! Although... Buffy the vampire slayer did save the multiverse. Was it just me or did Dr Strange gave the audience the literal finger towards the end? He did but this movie is PG13 so it wasn't that finger. Like everyone else who has a modicum of intelligence I too thought Thanos's motive was moronic as well as it was dumb. Try to follow my reasoning. He snaps his fingers and half the Universe's population is gone. What are the survivors going to do? Hmmm? The most logical thing is they will just breed again and then we're back to square one. We can't just assume that all species have the same gestation period as humans do. An elephant for instance has the gestation period of about 22 months, a whale about 16 months, a horse about 12 months, and cat and dogs about 58 DAYS... What about rabbits and rats? Oh about 22 days. My point is some species will repopulate their losses in a matter of days depending on how advanced their technology is or how fertile they are (we have no idea how aliens do their funny business and we don't want to know-just saying). So wiping out half the population isn't going to solve anything, quite the contrary. Humans would take about thirty to forty years to repopulate. In the meantime, you're going to have chaos and destruction following when people are suddenly disappearing when cars are suddenly crashing, planes are falling from the skies and nuclear reactors are going off or when nuclear silos are suddenly unguarded. All this would require more resources to be used to contain the chaos that would follow. Earth is tiny and we have limited resources, but the Universe has UNLIMITED resources! The Universe is very huge, LIKE HUMONGOUS HUGE! Any species that has mastered space technology can simply colonise an asteroid or planet and mine the heck out of it. Now, Thanos has a magic gauntlet which theoretically can give him whatever his giant heart desires. Even Thanos eventually acknowledges that his original plan is dumb and decides to recreate the Universe. Now THAT should have been his original plan. That I could understand. The Avengers used time travel to fix their problems... (Sigh-this is literally the laziest writing ever). The first time he snapped his fingers and kills half the Universe's population he becomes a gardener... A gardener! That is his endgame? Pointless genocide: check! Now I will go to my cucumber and tomato paradise: check! I wonder if Dr. Strange saw this in every one of his 14,000,605 outcomes and lost his mind. Did Dr Strange get so frustrated with all those versions ending up with Thanos gardening that he just gave up and gave him the stone? Why didn't Thanos dedicate himself to botany instead of being a warlord? I bet that by 14,000,606 it was the first time that it didn't end up with Thanos ending up in his cucumber and tomato paradise. So Ironman died because of some vegetables. That one version that Dr Strange wanted. Now let's talk about a geriatric Captain America (how did the writers come up this). Captain America goes back in time to be with the love of his life... How charming! Except that it isn't. He is a superhero with powers and knowledge of the future and the cold war and other really important stuff. Is he going to sit back while Hydra takes over SHIELD and destroys the very America he loves so much? What about Bucky who is being used as the Winter Soldier? I don't know about you but the Cap I know wouldn't just stand by and do nothing for 70 years. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent and twenty plus movies made just so Captain America could end up in a retirement home? No! Just no...",negative
Avengers endgame was a GREAT movie. Mist of the heroes were at their best: Captain america Iron man rocket hawkeye. Thor was GREAT too but he had Just some more kilos. The only negative was hulkin my opinion. But everything else was super this is the Best end in my opinion but we will miss Iron man and captain america.,positive
Entertaining movie. Mostly just fan service and weird plot holes. Go watch it. You've invested 10 years now. It's funny,positive
"I have been giving thoughts if I should still write about Avengers: Endgame. My brain is just blacked out. I cannot think of anything. Maybe because the movie left me broken after seeing it. And I'm afraid that if I try to remember the scenes from the movie, I might end up crying.I felt sad after watching Infinity War, but Endgame just rips your heart out.I was very silent after the movie. I went straight home after watching it. I can't handle it. I just watched the most anticipated movie of 2019 and the excitement and anticipation were replaced with too many emotions that is very impossible to contain. I thought I was ready to watch it, but I wasn't.I haven't written a review that doesn't contain spoilers, so I would like this to be different. And it's really hard to write without spoiling the movie if the very core of the movie is how we are attached to the characters all over these years. We have been rooting for them for too long and seeing the conclusion of the franchise is giving us mixed emotions. All good feelings, I assure you but as I mentioned too much to contain.I will watch it again, not to be broken again, but because this movie might be our last connection to the characters we ever love. (You'll know when you see the movie.)I'm sending this warning to all MCU fans who haven't seen it. Be very ready for every possible and impossible thing that might happen because this movie will give you an emotional blow. You will clap. You will jump. You will shout. You will cheer. You will cry. And heck, you will weep. I know I did. #AvengersEndgame #EndgameReview",positive
"Best marvel movie ever, conclusion of the 21 marvel movies don't think much just go for it 😍😍💟💟",positive
"They did such a great job with infinity War that Endgame wasn't able to deliver on the same level with the added pressure of being the grand finale. Part of the problem I think was that the story was developed to such a large-scale that was hard not to be so episodic, although it probably could have been done a lot better without losing the pacing with long, drawn out and sometimes awkward scenes.Some of the scenes felt like the writers didn't know which direction to go with characters and the direction they chose was not quite right. Endgame lacked a lot of the slick and fun banter that made the characters shine in previous movies. The writers had their moments but a lot of it could be pretty cringe-worthy at times.I get that everyone needed therapy after Infinity War but it felt a little too depressing for too long. All in all end game was a a good movie and it's evident that that Disney tried to put everything but the kitchen sink in this movie to please the fans which is appreciated. But I would have loved to have seen them spend more time crafting and polishing this into the Crown Jewel it's supposed to be rather than an uncut diamond.",positive
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we continue from were ""Avengers: Infinity War"" finished. The Avengers with the rest of their allies assemble to reverse what Thanos did and restore everything.I have to admit that I was expecting this movie after watching the ""Avengers: Infinity War"" because I wanted to see what will happen next. So, I had high expectations by this movie and thankfully I was not disappointed at all by it. The direction which was made for one more time by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo was simply outstanding and they followed their successful pattern and way. For one more time the interpretations of the cast made the difference and their combination proved why was so successful through all those movies including ""Avengers: Endgame"". To sum up, I have to say that ""Avengers: Endgame"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",positive
"People are out of their minds giving this movie a 10. It's good action and has some amazing visuals, but the story is seriously lacking and slowly plays out.They straight up ruin Thor and Hulk. I'm not sure what the purpose of having their movies were. I was waiting for Thor to summon the godly magic he has and transform back into the stud he was, but nope. Just the Lebowski version with lighting bolts flying out of his eyes. I hear people talking about ""oh he's got PTSD from all the things he's been through"". Give me a break. A. It's a movie. B. He's a God. C. Just give me the comic book hero we came to watch. Not this fat corny burnout.The Hulk. They made him a straight weenie. He's the ""professor hulk"" nobody wanted. Well, maybe six people total in the world. Everyone else wanted to see hulk finally get back to form and smash!!!! Instead he lightly taps a car hood and meanders off. The Bulk should never meander anywhere.Then there's the story that actually mainly revolves around the two characters you care nothing about. Nebula and Hawkeye. Sure they a cool to some degree but again, nobody wants to watch them on screen for hours.The whole time travel travesty they pulled with the alternative times lines really stupified things. I love how people say they can explain it when the writers and directors can't agree. Just google some articles and watch some interviews about it. In the end the time travel nonsense they pulled in the story doesn't make sense.Why is it that four avengers can take on Thanos with the Gauntlet and almost win, but non Gauntlet Thanos can whoop them all?How does Hawkeye live from that blast ending up in the sewer unharmed? How does starks human made nano tech suit hold the stones? I highly doubt it's nearly as powerful as a Gauntlet formed by giant elves from a dying star.Good lord, I could go on and on. There's three hours of this stuff. But what's good is an epic end battle and travels back to some of your favorite scenes from the previous films. Cap wielding the hammer is
The best part.All in all it's entertaining, but in. I way should be the categorized as one of the best movies ever.",positive
"This film is a great finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it wraps up all of their prior threads. There are references to years and years of films but it all feels like it comes together very naturally. The use of time travel was pretty well handled and didn't get as messy as in other films. The story itself and the twists were very engaging. One of my main concerns is Captain Marvel, who is so powerful that the writers have to contrive excuses for her to be elsewhere. Otherwise she could just solve most of the problems at once.",positive
"Seriously, this is probably one of the most overhyped movies that I have ever seen in my life, and a part of me wonders whether the MCU can actually survive after this film. Well, from looking at the reviews it seems like it satisfied quite a lot of people, but was it a good movie - well, no, not really. Okay, I enjoyed it, sort of, by the overhyped nature of this film sort of made it somewhat painful to sit through in places, and the three hour length, honestly, it could have simply been cut down somewhat.Look, don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily believe that this is a bad movie, but rather I felt that it was overtly long, overtly hyped, and in parts somewhat dull. As for the acting, well, it was passable, but not great. In fact I felt that Mark Ruffalo really didn't shine anywhere near as much as he did in the previous films.
Yet, the one thing that I'll give it credit for is the depth of the characters, and the fact that Captain Marvel did not dominate the film anywhere near as much as I, and many others, were expecting. The thing is that she popped in at the beginning, and at the end, and that was about it. The main focus of the film was on the three main Avengers from the original series.Yeah, okay, we also had Rocket Racoon playing a major role, and I'll certainly be giving it points for that - I love Rocket Racoon, and I suspect this is why he was brought into this film. In fact, by whittling down a lot of the characters did give it a bit more entertainment value, in that we weren't constantly jumping all over the place, as well as our attention being drawn apart by so many people. Instead we had what could be considered a core number and that was it.Mind you, they completely stuffed up the whole time line thing. You known, with the end part where they appeared to destroy Thanos and his cohorts. Then again, I also suspect that since they had time travelled to get here, they were probably just sent back to their original time line, namely so that we wouldn't end up having a complete Back to the Future style mess.Actually, that is something that I should mention, and that is the Back to the Future references. Yeah, we had a sort of jumping around to other parts of the series and reliving some of the older films. This, in part, made it feel like just one of those clip shows that some series tend to show because they are stuck for a story line. Then again, the clip show elements were rather small, and they ended up creating some interesting side shows, but it still felt like a clip.Oh, and then there was that part right at the beginning - it just happened too fast. After everything they had been through in the previous film, they pretty quickly found Thanos, and lopped his head of. Honestly, where was the master villian that we had seen in the previous film, the one that just seemed to be impossible to beat. Then again, I guess, without the infinity gauntlet, and his thugs, there probably isn't all that much to consider.",positive
They could have cut an hour and a half of the slow unimportant scenes.,negative
"This movie was build up since 2008. This has been one of the best MCU moments they ever shown. Not only this Movie was epic,but also emotional as well. This movie shown what is like to have an emotional roller coaster journey.Amazing conclusion to an epic journey.A fitting climax that takes infinity war to another level.I am Already planning to see it again.This is the movie that Marvel fans deserved.",positive
Only 1 word for this movie. WOW. This is so spectacular and great movie.,positive
"Couldnt help feeling that Endgame is to Infinity Wars what Dark Knight Rises was to Dark Knight.A good follow up but the bar was already set too high. Very entertaining, with a satisfying ending, but got there after quite a few plot holes and unanswered questions.It felt like the writers wrote the ending first and then tried really hard to take us to that end, regardless of what plot holes they were forced to leave in the wake.PS didn't really like what they did to Thor and Hulk. Good for laughs maybe, but the characters deserved better",positive
"I'll start by saying before Infinity War, I always thought that most Marvel films were a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me, they were all enjoyable, however the thing they so drastically lacked was a strong baddie.
My issue with the first Avengers was Loki being so non threatening, and everyone I talk to about this seems to agree, however the breakthrough at the time was just to have all their heroes on screen together.
You then had Avengers Age of Ultron, which had the baddie being a creation of Tony Stark, which I found unexciting, despite it being a fun watch.
The two impressive Captain America sequels, the third of which had our heroes fighting against each other, again something I found to be a little underwhelming.Then came Infinity War, which for me totally raised the bar, and properly introduced one of the most threatening, and in my opinion Iconic baddies we have seen on the screen since Nolans Bane in TDKR. I was extremely dissapointed to not see more people dressed up as the mad titan last Halloween (no shortage of Harley Quinns and Jokers still).
Infinity War ended with what is unquestionably the greatest shock in superhero film history, which then set up what promised to be a fascinating follow up.This film did not disappoint, and even if you are not a fan of superhero movies in general, I would strongly urge any film fan to at least watch both Infinity War and Endgame both. I am certain even the most hard nosed film critic (the type that boo every film at Cannes) can appreciate the quality of film-making on display here.I have seem some passionate YouTubers making videos about plot-holes being uncovered throughout this film, however given the direction the story took, I can imagine the difficulty the filmmakers had weaving this all together, and I am confident they did the best they could.
Essential viewing.",positive
After disappointment with both infinity war which on 2nd viewing wasn't as bad as I remembered either and also captain marvel it was a mixture of nerves and hope they could cap it off properly and boy did they deliver the best 3 hours of film I can remember that absolutely flew by. The perfect ending to a largely amazing set of films. A truly mind blowing experience.,positive
Marvel has over the years delivered movie after movie and we have been watching. Not only did they give us the ending we needed but they did it in a way which connected everything we have seen through the MCU. I just want to some how forget that the MCU exists so that I can watch all the movies all over again. Will definitely be seeing Endgame again in cinema.,positive
"I didn't like to see Thor being humiliated , why would you do that for a such a mighty character ? Also I didn't like Hulk since Infinity War. Apart from those things , the movie was good .",positive
"I hardly think anyone could fairly admit to disappointment after experiencing the sufficiently bombastic, tearful and wacky conclusion to a decade of Marvel content that delivers on every promise and gives (as others have stated before me) back to the fans in a very unique way.The entire movie is a spoiler. That said...there isn't a whole lot more TO say. If Infinity War was your cup of tea, Endgame is going to do everything you want it to... but not in the way you expect it to. Yes, there's a measure of predictability; but there's also plenty of surprises - a mix of both, really, which feels just about right.My feelings a few hours after seeing Endgame are as follows: Sad, a little depressed that some things will never be the same going forward. I know all good earthly things have an end - sometimes it's a little difficult to accept. In a way, the good ol' days are now officially ""old"". On the flip side of the coin, I'm a little exuberant about the possibilities opened up, the new concepts explored, and probably more than anything, the completely perfect fanfare that had the folks at my cinema cheering and applauding at every turn. In other words, I'm experiencing mixed emotions. Decipher my very cryptic notes as you will... but see Endgame for yourself. It's hardly something to be missed. And it's hardly something to be forgotten.Some people move on. But not us.Not us.",positive
"I cannot exactly understand why everyone celebrates this movie as if it were genius. In my opinion, it is not. It's good, very good but not genius.Infinity war was epic. An epic tale, with great heroes and a terrifying and captivating villain. It was dramatic. Unexpected and intense things happened (Gamorrha death e.g.). Endgame does lack most of these cherries on the cake. Sure it gives us some great moments. The beginning made me feel again (Hawkeye, Tony's entrance etc.). However it stays within the realm of delivering nostalgia. It does not make enough use of the time travel plot. Not enough crazy mindbending storyline to offer. There are way better time travel stories out there. All this movie does while ""time traveling"" is getting nostalgic. Tony's demise was not that surprising nor was that everyone else was resurrected. The only crazy ""twist"" was Natasha dying.In between the movie also got kind of boring in my opinion. A feeling I never had once during Infinity war. Thanos did not feel like a huge threat nor did anything else. They could have made so much more mindbending twists of the time traveling but with the alternative reality direction etc. sure it's kind of set up to be uninteresting. (maybe thanos should have known all along? Maybe they should have made it a conflict of Tony having to decide between his life now and bringing the ""old way"" and people back? Maybe something else? But give me more final thrill and darkness, in such a final piece please). Captain Marvel felt entirely displaced. The only thing she does (again) is showing up and destroying spaceships. And some logic holes spanning the movie (e.g. at the end why are all of Peter's classmates still his age and nobody 5 years older--> highly unlikely outcome?).It maybe wasn't supposed to be another infinity war but except for Steve Rogers I am not sure anybody got Endgame here.",positive
"It's a bad movie. I can't believe they screwed up the most important movie in the franchise. The writing was bad, the basic laws of time that they tried to follow were contradicted, and overall, it was just a terrible plot. I wish John Favreau directed the more significant Marvel movies...",negative
"Avengers: Endgame (2019)
BROKE MY SCALE 20/10""A finale so masterfully constructed, Avengers: Endgame proves to us that a finale WILL do whatever it takes to treat the fans with an emotionally moving, action-packed masterpiece.""I am just blown away by how well Endgame does for itself. My expectations were stacked, and the film somehow managed to surpass those expectations. Like Infinity War, Endgame manages to strategically balance the humor with the seriousness of specific aspects, you'll either be laughing or crying, or both at certain points. The action still stands out as a fair product of entertainment, going to the extremity of any situation, no matter how impossible it may have seemed; taking risky moves to get the film's point across the table. Lastly, the characters are so well written in this, sometimes its just hard to believe that our original heroes conclude their stories in this tearjerking finale; it really is hard to say goodbye sometimes when we've grown on these characters since day one. I can even say that Thanos' character is basically given the upgrade in sociopathic motive, making him somewhat unpredictable just like the predecessor. The film does have its minimalistic flaws (like any other film) but I felt that these flaws are completely ineffective towards the the whole idea of what points the film intends to display.Verdict: Avengers: Endgame marks the end of an era that lasted 11 years. It concludes a story so fashionably well, its safe to say to bring the tissue and bring the applause, because there's no way in hell anyone was prepared for this epic finale.
One more thing, I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in the making of Endgame (especially the Russo Brothers), and anyone who contributed to the build up to this conclusion we've all waited for. And a final thank you to the man himself, Stan Lee, for showing us that the real heroes are the fans because WE made it happen. May he rest in peace, thank you for reading folks.",positive
"This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a TV show finale. After 21 episodes that are all feature length. And before you can even say ""oh no those are all terrible"", this immediately proves itself to be an exception to that rule. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. Make sure you avoid spoilers before watching this.This picture moves fast and packs a lot into its not quite lean running time. In other words, it's directed by the Russo Brothers. The length is justified. I wouldn't cut anything from this. The emotional moments don't feel sappy. The countless callbacks and references don't feel like they're just there to make you feel good for paying attention to all that lead to this one. The acting shows just how well all of these performers understand the characters. And the screenplay does the same for the writers. The effects are astonishing, yet again getting us to care about individuals that we know are all CG. It uses the varied skills, equipment and the like, of the unique heroes and villains, creatively. This delivers deeply satisfying closure. It truly is a conclusion. It's not trying to get you back to the theatre for the next adventure. The few currently confirmed entries into this franchise don't need hyping, anyway. Spider-Man with Mysterio? Another Black Panther story? The unfairly fired James Gunn returning to round out the trilogy of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Solo Black widow, *finally*? More Dr Strange? Shang-Chi, The Eternals, Blade? Keep 'em coming.I recommend this to everyone who's taken this entire journey. And if you're someone who's skipped some, or held off on this series up to this point, this is an excellent reason to address that. Unless they're simply not to your liking. This is not going to change that. It's not meant to. 10/10",positive
"It's hard to put into words my feelings after seeing this film. Endgame is an epic, unpredictable, and emotional end to the most impressive long-form storytelling in cinematic history. This film is captivating for its entire 3 hour run time, with every scene and piece of dialogue carefully crafted with purpose. The payoffs and callbacks to previous moments in the MCU are amazing and reward those who have been loyal to this franchise. Avengers: Endgame absolutely surpasses the massive expectations it had and closes the book perfectly on an unprecedented saga of films.",positive

"""This is going to work, Steve.""""I know it will. Because I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.""So spoke Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to Captain America (Chris Evans) in the opening act of Avengers: Endgame. Quite poetically, leading into this crossover event, the above interaction no doubt reflects the minds of all Marvel fans flooding to see Endgame in the coming weeks. Naturally, fans are longing to watch their favourite characters together on screen for one last blast, but also desperate that the conclusion to this incredible 11-year journey lives up to expectations.Endgame's prologue sees our heroes defeated; Thanos' (Josh Brolin) infamous finger-snap at the end of Avengers: Infinity War - coined officially as 'The Decimation' - has wiped out half of all living creatures in the universe. Now, the Avengers must unite one more time to reverse this grave catastrophe, ""whatever it takes.""So, has Marvel managed to make this overwhelmingly ambitious project ""work""? The short answer: yes. Infinite times over, yes. Avengers: Endgame is not only a truly engrossing culmination to the 'Infinity Saga', it is also nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece.The journey that began with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in Iron Man back in 2008 is very intelligently tied up in Endgame. As the film unfolds, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's meticulous story planning becomes evident and gradually proves to be the most satisfying payoff any Marvel fan could have hoped for. Marvel President Kevin Feige alongside directors Anthony and Joe Russo have completed an impossible feat; Endgame is humorous, heart-breaking and perpetually captivating. It more than exceeds any presupposition laid before it with a swagger more equanimous than Stark's ego, whilst also moulding an open route forward for the inevitable continuation of this formidable franchise. It's one-of-a-kind experience; the perfect milestone to end this gigantic adventure, yet a glorious beginning for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Endgame's greatest filmic achievement though, lies in its steady pace and indulgent narrative; taking things slow but never wasting time, yet speeding along whilst never rushing, everything fits perfectly into place in this 3-hour work of genius with a sophistication indicative of a Francis Ford Coppola paragon. Sure, it's a high-budget superhero blockbuster featuring spectacular special effects, but as Marvel has proven before, that doesn't mean a superhero film cannot tackle tones and styles not necessarily affiliated with the genre. In the realisation of its ambition, Endgame catapults the superhero genre to an unprecedented spectrum of film accomplishment; it is quite frankly a piece of cinematic art, encapsulating yet conquering all that has come before it with majesty and self-assuredness.But as noted by Stark, ""part of the journey is the end"", and now the curtain draws on this dazzling superhero adventure. Though the encore of 'Phase Three' is yet to be seen in Spider-Man: Far From Home (releasing this July), Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent finale which allows The Avengers we so know and love the opportunity to sign off in remarkable fashion, leaving behind a Hulk-sized stamp on Hollywood history which will remain for 'infinity'.Avengers... Assemble. And take a bow.",positive
"As much as I would like to rate this higher, simply I can't. ""Avengers: Endgame"" could have been a perfect MCU movie, but it has too way many plot holes and unanswered questions. I understand that it's possible that some of the questions will be answered in the TV series, but even so, there are a lot of storywise irregularities! I think that the whole plot has been presented too fast-paced, but the plot's main subject is really both interesting and solid. The biggest plot hole is about Captain America's return in the past, because the movie doesn't show what has really happened while he was in the past, using the quantum realm technology. How did he return the stones? Where did he return them? What enemies and obstacles encountered and most important of all, why is he old? It's even the same Captain America, from the actual timeline, or it's another one, from a parallel universe? I guess we will never find out, because the movie should have been even longer, with at least an additional hour, in order to make us understand, what has really happened and how.Apart from the whole pile of plot holes and undesired mysteries, the movie is good enough and it has some very great visual and special effects, combined with a lot of suspenseful and emotional scenes. I don't think that it's better than ""Avengers: Infinity War"", because the former has a not so solid plot, but it didn't make me to wonder how certain characters acted in a specific way and why certain events occurred at a one specific time.""Avengers: Endgame"" it's worth watching and it's definitely a lot better than some of the other movies in the entire MCU, but it's definitely not the best movie either. I would suggest you to chronologically watch the entire MCU movie franchise, before watching this one and to search on the internet for the answers to your questions, because you won't find any in here.",positive
"Come on people.
Why is every Marvel movie so overrated?
I rate them as what they deserve. Infinity War was pretty much the only outstanding movie in the franchise. They did something what noone dared before. That was a very good movie.This one? 7 at best. How on Earth can anyone just a little bit of brain rate this higher over movies Inception, Matrix, Goodfellas, etc almost the whole top250 movies. Are you mad? For real..This one was full of nonsense. They basicly setup something that shows and tells you who's how strong. When they show in the end of Infinity War that Thor now can beat Thanos easily, then how comes that he still has all the power but Thanos now can rip him apart without a single stone.Glad it is finally ended. Sick of seeing every trash being in the top250 because of little fan boys that haven't even seen sh**.",positive
Yeah it's even much better than all Marvel and dc movies and much better than Dark knight. Finally Marvel did it👌 More than a Movie,positive
"I'm going to break this film into 3 parts.
Part 1 - 10/10
Part 2 - 7/10
Part 3 - 4/10Part 1:
It starts off perfect - the scenes with Hawkeye, Nebula and Tony, and the twist with Thanos destroying the stones are all top notch.The perfection continues as we jump ahead 5 years. The emotional weight of the snap is still felt in our characters, and you really get a sense of the dread and despair.Then Tony discovers time travel in about 11 seconds.Part 2:
We get to the meat of the film, and some odd choices are made. The first are the drastic changes in two characters: Thor and Hulk. They are now pure comic relief. I am not a particularly big fan of either of them, and I thought Thor's transformation into The Big Lebowski was very funny at times; but boy do I feel bad if you're fans of these characters.The time travel scenes themselves are a mixed bag. Tony, Captain America and Ant Man stealing the Mind and Space stones is fantastic. Tony and Cap going back further in time, not so much. I know Tony has daddy issues - we dealt with this back in Iron Man 2 - and I know Cap likes the lady he knew for a few days back in the 40s. This is the bathroom break scene.Hulk retrieves the Time Stone by making up an absurd promise he can't possibly know he'll keep. The entire Thor and Rocket scene could've been cut without losing anything except Cap getting the hammer later in the film I guess.The Soul Stone scene with Black Widow's death didn't work for me. It's one thing if the person getting the stone has to sacrifice that which he loves. It's another if the thing you love makes the choice for you. It didn't work for me. Which is unfortunate because I like Black Widow and was disappointed to see her die.Nebula (who might be my favorite character in this film) sets up the return of Thanos. Really liked how this was handled, even if it is a bit far fetched and doesn't make a ton of sense how Thanos got to the future.Part 3:
Here's where the film gets sloppy and makes poor choices. Hulk snaps his fingers, Thanos arrives, and we get the cool action scene of our original 3 heroes vs Thanos. Cap becomes worthy and gets the hammer (and...can also summon lightening?), but still gets his ass kicked. All good stuff.And then...Sigh.The ""epic"" ending to this film is the equivalent of an 11 year old dumping 3 bins of Marvel action figures onto the floor and playing with them for what seems like 9 hours. I didn't mind what some people lament as ""fan service"" up until this point, because we were focused on a few characters we really care about, that have been with us for about a decade.So many characters do so many things that I stopped caring, when the previous fight between Captain America, Iron Man and Thor vs Thanos was so much better. Go back to that! But you know, instead they have to cram every single character into this scene - including Pepper Pots in an Iron Man suit. Captain ""Cheat Codes"" Marvel comes in and does her thing. Spiderman activates ""instant kill."" Dr. Strange stops a flood or something.My mind starts wandering and I think ""what is the point of the Space Stone if every wizard can open portals between worlds?"" And ""where were half these people in the last movie?"" And ""is Pepper in the Iron Man suit just so the scene with all the women looks more full, especially since they killed off the main one I care about?"" And ""why isn't anyone saying 'Hulk, wtf do you mean we have to return these stones?!?!?!'""Tony's death is unfortunately so predictable and crammed into this mess that it doesn't register as strongly as it should. Intimate fight scenes, like in the end of Civil War or Black Panther, are always much better than massive battle scenes. At the least, you need to separate the two.What should've happened is Tony and Cap decide to take the Gauntlet as far away as possible from the battle. Thor and Hulk try to hold off Thanos. Hulk succeeds in holding off Thanos long enough for them to escape, redeeming himself from his last fight with Thanos. But Thanos manages to catch up with Tony and Cap. They fight him, but Thanos is clearly too powerful. Realizing they can't beat Thanos, Cap puts on the Gauntlet and sacrifices himself (yes - Cap should've died, not Tony). This way, even if there is a still massive CGI fest for the kids, at least there's this more intimate battle between our main characters. That's why Infinity Wars worked so well IMO. You had the big battle in Wakanda, and the more intimate fight with Thanos.The very end is pure schmaltz. I'm not sure what went on with Cap - if that's a contradiction to how time travel works, or for some reason he was beamed back outside the portal? Either way, didn't like it.If they put the Stones back in the other universes, aren't there still no stones in theirs, meaning their universe is threatened by all the dark forces or whatever? I think I would've just screwed over those other universes, but that's me.Wouldn't mind seeing a spinoff movie where Loki has the Space Stone.",positive
"I'm going to make a leap here, just to leep things simple. The cumulative effect of so called ""super heroes"" is to the true film fan what the white man was to Native Americans: End of life as they knew it. There are 25 actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes, like their studios. Why do you think great actors and directors wouldn't be caught dead in these cartoon films? Because they are the antithesis to great film making. Its really sad. I understand my 13 year old daughter seeing something like this. I don't understand older, more mature people acting like these are real films becauseT they arent. They are like the cartoons you woukd watch, before the main attraction started. They all have been dumbed down for the masses to the same exact plot: Good versus Evil; always. I wouldn't, no couldn't; sit through 15 minute of this pablum, not even if you paid me a year's salary to watch. It""s woeful trash, and is ruining the film industry. Stanley Kubrick the master of all the great directors, is rolling over in his grave. You won't see the top directors making any of this trash. People like Abel Ferrara, Marty Scorcese, Ridley Scott, William Friedkin, Spike Lee, or Denis Villeneuve go near a movie such as this. Its all publicity! All you hear about is how much money is made in the opening weeks, but nothing about what the films are like. It makes me sick. I would rather have my teeth drilled without novacaine than watch this. The same goes for the best actors. No way you will see ever see people like Bobby DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Matt Damon, Colin Farrell, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, or Al Pacino in any of these movies. I understand completely. It's simple. They have integrity! Skip this woeful hyped up trash and go see a real film; not a cartoon.",negative
"I found Avengers Endgame difficult to watch but only because it was beautiful and painful.
There are two ways to enjoy this movie, one as a fun time heist, throwback, exciting blockbuster with some snappy oneliners and a healthy dose of gloss, the closure of some main character arcs and some significant resolution (although also with a heady dose of sequel potential of course.).The other way to view this movie is a movie in touch with the heart of grief and loss, and also just losing. It's deeply sad throughout and people try to put a brave face on as you do, but grief is no slouch and it clearly takes constant work for them all just to buck up and rally around another one of sad-faced Captain America's many speeches.
It all culminates in the death of Iron Man and the eventual death of Captain America and both men get what they want. Lives without all this pain; The burden of responsibility and honour. When Stark dies it's quick but it feels earned, and when Potts leans in to him and allows him to go, he doesn't register anything on his face because he's dying. But you hope he registers it somewhere before he does.
I'd need to see it again to appreciate the nuances and the Easter eggs but I was profoundly moved by watching these people (characters) we know well by now, in the kinds of pain we will all go through. And strangely it overtook my experience of the movie but not in a bad way.So I gave it 5 stars. When I wash it clean from my mind and watch it again. I'll be able to assess its many levels, achievements and flaws. But as a film about loss. It's superbly layered and surprisingly effective and therefore I say it's pretty much succeeded on a human level. For something with a massive green dude in spectacles and fat Thor in it, that's saying something.",positive
The genre has been completed. It was the best superhero film ever. It completed an epic journey of superhero films.,positive
"It's impossible to watch a film of this much scale, history, cultural importance, and franchise-carrying characters in a vacuum. No other franchise has the balls, nor the emotional buildup that it carries to justify a 3-hour runtime in a world where those kinds of runtimes are limited to fantasy epics (Lord of the Rings) or old glorious 70 millimeter films (Lawrence of Arabia). I guess that's what best describes Endgame, it is a glorious and grossly satisfying epic, and one that will soon become a classic etched and immortalized in the cultural consciousness of a generation.If there's one thing that Marvel has done properly, its understanding how to do good on their characters. The MCU has thrived because it has consistently followed a philosophy of putting characters first. There is a reason why this movie broke pre-sale records, why there were cheers, tears and rounds of applause from the audience in each shining moment of the film. Endgame takes Marvel's character-driven storytelling to its extreme and most appealing. Infinity War largely proved how Marvel knows how to divide it characters, unite them all with one common threat and theme, and deliver a punch in the gut ending that had fans dusting their tears.At the start of Endgame, fans are at the same emotional headspace as their favorite characters who are at a loss for hope. Right off the bat, the Russo brothers as directors have put themselves in a corner that allowed them to find a creative way out of it. Together with screenplay writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the story feels more rich, poignant, and satisfying. It goes without saying that you shouldn't go into this film expecting a high-art, indie slow burner, it still flows and feels very much like a Marvel movie, but the difference is that it is more restrained. The film opts for quieter, relaxed, and introspective scenes between characters. Steve, Tony, Clint, Natasha, Thor, and Banner all get their moments to shine, and it's clear that this is the original six's movie if Infinity War was Thanos'.Each fan service moment feels earned, despite it being obviously shameless and pandering, it feels like the Avengers can justify showing off a little especially after 11 years of buildup. Nothing beats the collective gasps and thunderous applause you get from the audience whenever each iconic moment occurs. Endgame is clearly, unapologetically, and triumphantly made for the fans. Each scene, each line of dialogue and each callback is constructed passionately and with care. No arcs in the last 11 years were left forgotten and left in the dust.As an epilogue to the now titled ""Infinity Saga"", this film works best as the season finale of a long running cinematic television epic. If you see it that way, you'll understand the motivations behind the creative decisions that the filmmakers made. Each plot point may feel overused or something you've seen before, but the people behind the scenes know it and even acknowledge it within the film. It doesn't mean they are unmotivated, but rather the opposite, they use it to stunning effect for incredibly emotional payoffs that honestly feels like a miracle that they managed to pull it off.In the end, what more is there to say about this movie? Aside from its consistently stunning visuals, creative cinematography, coherent action set pieces, and kick-ass musical score, this film is all about emotion and getting the catharsis you've always wanted as a fan, a normal moviegoer, or as a little kid. Some people grew up with the MCU, 11 years is a damn long time and I'm definitely part of those who did. I guess this is what those kids in the 70s-80s felt when they saw Star Wars.Verdict: 4.8/5",positive
"This movie has to doso much and bring together so many different characters and to resolve the situation from Infinity War in a satisfying way, and they did it! I love re-watching this movie, it's amazing.I think some of the plot points are a bit contrived, but overalliit's just amazing that they pulled it off so well.",positive
"I'm sure there are sites dedicated to the time travel inconsistencies in this movie so I won't go into them. There were a lot. That end fight was just way too much, I was checking the time and ready for it to wrap up by then. My favorite heroes were under utilized.It was a good ending to the infinity series. I'm not sure what I was expecting. I was just ready for it to be over by then.",positive
"Look if you are not a fan of marvel or the avengers then this movie will give a small satisfaction but if you are a marvel fan you are the passengers of this journey (2008-2019) then this movie will give you happiness,sadness,a lot of comedy and much more.",positive
"First of all, visually this is amazing movie. I saw it in Imax 3d and i feared i will not enjoy it , because action movies with fast scenes dont feel so good in 3d, but because of its slower pace, one could really enjoy the scenery, especially the space scenes. I generally liked the plot(going back in time etc), although there are serious holes in the plot but whatever, its a comic book fantasy movie so anything goes, right. Going back and revisiting crucial moments was also done very well,funny and reminding of all the other great MCU movies, it really tied up everything well. There was not so many obvious jokes, but still few good funny moments.
The downside for me is how I never can understand how this superheros match their powers - like in the beginning, Captain Marvel grabs Thanos, Thor slices him up like a chunk of butter,. but on the end fight, she cannot get to him, and Thor fights him both with his axe and hammer, plus Captain America and Iron-man and they cannot do anything to him. Thanos has some strange looking blade which is obviously much stronger than all their weapons , and Captain Marvel. So this really bothers me even in the previous movies, is like the script writers can write whatever they want and anything goes, right. Again you can see, I can tolerate so much BS until i start to get bored and feel like i dont have an IQ less then 80 or im 12 years old.
I dont see why it had to be 3 hour long, they could easily cut down the drama BS and make it 2.5h. Also, I am really really sad that Black Widow is gone - she was the best for me, a true hero without any gadgets, super powers or powerful weapons. And finally, its sad that all american series and movies put a lot of point on the characters making a drama , fuss and blaming each other - adults and especially super heroes should be more balanced - and that was Natasha's part in the MCU, she was always so rational and calm .
I will watch this once more it comes out on Bluray but i dont i will be coming back more then that. Unlike the first Avangers, or even Infinity war..",positive
"This movie is the best marvel have ever made.A 3 hour masterpiece , don't read the reviews just go see it .",positive
"I'll keep it as short as possible and spoiler free, I didn't expect this movie to be better than Infinity War but it was a disappointment, unfortunately...
The cons first:
a) This movie is almost an MCU clip show. I won't spoil the plot but to me it felt repetitive. Like eating reheated pizza.
b) Too slow. Do you remember the action sequences and the fast pace of Infinity War? Forget that. Literaly there's almost no action for the first one hour and a half!
c) Dispropotional screen time. Unlike infinity War, the majority of superheroes have too little screen time (I'm talking about fighting scenes). Again, I can't spoil anything but some heroes have two or three lines and a ten second action scene.
d) Thanos himself. Unfortunatelly Thanos wasn't as good (or should I say... bad) as he was in Infinity War, he almost feels like a heavy bag with a few lines (and I mean few).
e) Predictable plot (maybe that's only me).
f) The final big battle feels hasty and bad edited. There are too much going on on screen with a very little time for each character.
g) It has a pessimistic and dark tone.
Now the pros:
a) Solid conclusion. The movie is a solid conclusion of MCU's phase 3 (and perhaps MCU itself).
b) Good humor. That's not a surprise for a Marvel movie, there's plenty of tasteful humor and in the correct amount.
c) Good performances. Nothing to add here.
d) No political agendas. I hate it when it happens and thankfully this movie is ok (there are one or two cringeworthy scenes though, but nothing importand).
e) There are some good action scenes and the effects are awesome.
Overall, it felt rushed and it lacks the majestic feeling of Infinity War. I can remember plenty of scenes in Infinity War which gave me goosebumps, unfortunately there's none in Endgame...
Final verdict: 6/10 when I compare it to Infinity War (it's unavoidable), 7/10 as a stand-alone MCU film. In my opinion it's the third best Avengers movie (right below Infinity War and the first one). I didn't regret watching it at the theater, in fact I suggest you to do it, but I won't watch it a second time...",positive
"The biggest problem of this movie is time travel. In the End Game, time travel is both ex machina and the driving part of the plot. It was expected to have a time travel element but it took up so much of the movie that it weakened the overall impact of the Infinity set of movies.",negative
"Everyone and their mother has likely talked about how this film is over a decade in the making so I won't bring that up to much except to say that this film, like Infinity War, relies on that history. And this is a good thing as it has a lot of new content that builds off that foundation. Avengers: Endgame is filled with some shocking twists, heart wrenching deaths, and amazing cinematic moments you will never forget. If you even slightly enjoy the Marvel films, you cannot pass up seeing this movie. If Infinity War was daring in using most of its run time for villain focus and battles, this one is unique in how different its three acts are from one another. It makes the film quite re-watchable despite its length. And it all leads up to a finale you have to see to believe. Characters like Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Captain America shine like never before, as the writing for characters is incredibly strong in this movie. I would not say this is the best Avengers film. Its pacing can seem sluggish the first time around and some characters are treated as jokes more than they ought. However, the final act utilizes even its weaknesses to deliver on a satisfying conclusion. The only question left in your mind will be ""Where will Marvel take us next?""",positive
"Despite the garbage marvel has become in recent years the storytelling, acting and conclusion to decade long character arcs is top class in this film. To the reviewers giving this a 1, you need to get a life and respect what we have witnessed as it is unlikely we will ever see this again given the infiltration of wokeness in Hollywood.Go see this movie if you haven't. It is great.",positive
"First off, a great applause to the members (Director, Writers, Crews, Cast etc..) behind the extraordinary movie. Avengers Endgame is a terrific example of that epic intimacy that Marvel does so well - alternating between glorious action and subtle character moments. Watching it almost feels like taking a wistful walk down memory lane, flanked on either side by a Russo brothers, our hands held firmly in theirs. . It was a perfect ""ending"" of the 21 Movies.The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. They captured the emotion perfectly. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath.Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited.Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. Thank you stan lee for making the superheroes ....",positive
"Avengers: End Game can't compete on its own against the likes of The Godfather, Citizen Kane, or The Dark Knight, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has never been about competing on your own. The MCU parallels it's own characters in the sense that it's strength lies not in each individual, but rather the sum of their parts. Avengers: End Game is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the seemingly untouchable Infinity Saga, whose 10 year presence has changed cinema forever.",positive
"Avengers:Endgame
Directed by the Russo Brothers. Written by Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeelyThis is one of the most anticipated movies ever released. It is one of the biggest movies ever made. It has destroyed various box office records. This is Avengers:Endgame. This really is the end of an era started by Iron Man. It has changed the landscape of cinema bringing the idea of shared universes to the forefront and making all those studio executives jealous and salivating for their opportunity. But what is the movie itself like?It really is 3 movies in 1 and it works beautifully that way. I liked Infinity War but my goodness was that movie utterly exhausting by the time we reached its downbeat conclusion. This one allows you to live in the aftermath. It allows you to focus more on the characters themselves. It is truly the story of Captain America and Iron Man. Their paths have always been intertwined. Tony's father helped with the creation of Captain America. They meet again in the Avengers and form a bond only to have that bond tested by Bucky turning up again as the Winter Soldier. Civil War culminated with their battle. Thanos showing up forces them to come back together to fight this battle. This is truly their film through and through. Everyone else is along for the ride.Robert Downey Jr is Iron Man. He will be forever. He has personified this character in all the ups and downs. He has been the foundation of the entire MCU. Chris Evans as Captain America is the glue holding it in that spot. Who takes these spots going forward? I've followed them throughout this entire journey and I honestly think this is the best ending that could have been hoped for. It is the end of the original Avengers.The action is top notch but then again for 200+million dollar movie, I would expect no less. They have some Back to the Future 2 style moments when they go back in time in an effort to steal the infinity stones before the big snap. There are some excellent call backs to previous movies in the ongoing Marvel series. This really is a film dedicated to the fans. I'm not sure if someone going into this particular film cold will get the same excitement and feeling but then again why on Earth would anyone see Endgame without seeing anything else? That's just insane.I give this movie a B.",positive
"I'm among those people, who normally don't engage in writing reviews. But this time I really have and want to. I rewatched the infinity-saga prior to Engame's release and there couldn't have been a better ending to it then the one it got. It really has been an epic ride and I feel privileged to have been able to be a part of it. Though only being a spectator, I feel connected to these characters, they are like long know friends. Endgame is the epic and monumental end to the saga which began over a decade ago. And oh it is more then worthy to be the last milestone on this incredible journey. I went through so many emotions watching this, joy, pride, happiness, sorrow and a sense of being alive and what it means to be human. Just watch it, you'll see what I mean, I really don't promise too much. It's truely hard to say goodbye to so many beloved characters, but they get the ending they deserve and will always be the franchise's core. Thank you for this amazing journey Marvel.",positive

"I wait this film without any patience. I hope that it would be one of the greatest film of MCU. My hope became the truth. In me point of view, this film is great from all aspects of cinema. Firstly, the story is amazing, the screenwriters did the great work, despite of 3 hours, no moments looks very long or boring. Twisted moments happen in the right place, most of actions of characters are logical. The authors have big attention to little details and ""easters"" due the film. Secondly, the cast is awesome, so many characters of comics together were the first time in the history. Some characters' lines ends, and this finish looks great (Iron Man and Captain America). Thirdly, the visual effects is wonderful.
So, it's one of greatest oan biggest film ever.",positive
"2,5 hours of nonsense and gigantic plotholes. 15 minutes of action which is a total mess. CGI looks good, bit dark. Thor, one of the strongest badass characters in Marvel Universe is a drunk fat dude, does not make sense. Cap. America who can use Thors Hammer suddenly with lightning abilities, why? Cap. Marvel is OP, shows up randomly does huge amounts of damage and dissapears again list goes on and on... Iron man is the only character in this movie who deservers credits in my opinion. Infinity war is way better, its really overrated.",positive

"The good:. The fan service was very good
It gave people what they wanted, a heroic send-off for Iron Man and sentimental ending for Captain America. The revisiting of previous movies was great overall. I almost lost my mind when Cap picked up Thor's hammer. I was glad Captain Marvel wasn't in the movie very much.The bad:. U was hoping the Russo's would give Capt Marvel a better character, more likeable. The interaction between her and Peter at the end was best bit if dialogue she has had. The biggest thing though was I just couldn't get past the time travel and creation of a multiverse. By creating this multiverse and their actions not affecting the past, it lowered the stakes. Loki gets away, no problem, we'll just ignore that and go to another point in history to get what we need. Thamos from Guardians of Galaxy dies, no problem. I know there is a certain level of suspension of disbelief in all MCU movies. These just felt like a cheap and easy way to write. So Cap creates a new timeline by living in the past apparently. Does he stop Hydra from infiltrating SHIELD? Does he prepare his timeline for Thanos?Also, it probably hurt that we had to wait a year. the build up was massive and nothing can really live up to that level of hype.I've seen it twice and I don't care to see again for awhile. I have seen Infinity War 7 times as point of reference.",positive
"Characters killed in Avengers: Infinity War weren't brought back by the 2nd snap. Vision and Loki were killed. Thanos wasn't actually killed at the end of Endgame, he was snapped in to non existence. Using Pym particles and the Antman suit, one could go back, retrieve the Infinity Stones, and with another snap Thanos can be brought back. In theory, anyone with Pym particles and the Antman suit could travel throughout time, retrieve the stones, return to the present, wipe out all life in the entire universe, then go back in time to the point the stones were taken.",positive
"******** Containers Spoilers ****************So here goes with a review of the most anticipated film of all time probably? I have to say I am a fan of Superhero movies and don't worry if it is Marvel or DC but I have to say that in my opinion this movie didn't live up to the hype. Is it a bad movie? No but it is not one of Marvels finest. I am sure that hardcore Marvel fans will love it but it could (and should) have been better.It was obvious that after the events of Infinity War, Endgame had to finish with a better outcome. Obviously, time travel would be needed somewhere and true to form it was. I don't have too much of an issue with this but whilst it led to some great interaction with previous Marvel movies and TV series it also left a lot of plot holes that in the end you have to ignore so that you can enjoy the movie however as I left the movie I couldn't help thinking of how it was a little screwed up. However, we must just go with it as after all it is entertainment.One of my issues was the flow of the movie. If I am honest the first half goes a little too slow and there are some scenes that maybe didn't need to be there. I know we wanted to see the outcome of the snap but seeing all our heroes depressed wasn't necessary. Thor especially took this badly, but his humour was one of the highpoints of the film for me.The trouble with having so many Superheroes is you never really get to see enough of everyone in the film. Lots are of course missing due to the Thanos snap in IW but during the middle part we get to see lots of them but only for a limited time. The lift scene with Captain America was pure gold and seeing Tony stark with his Dad was great as well.Anyway after various escapades and 5 years our heroes gather all the stones and reverse Thanos cruel snap but we don't have time to see what happens bar for a phone call and some birds flying around as evil Thanos from 2013 manages to appear with his huge space ship and army (despite the fact they have no time machine and only one small pym particle??!!) and blow the Avengers HQ to smithereens!! Luckily??!! Not one of our heroes is injured?? And cue big fight time. Thor, Captain America and Iron Man do there best to fight with Thanos but can't beat him and just when it seems all is lost and the army of Thanos is about to lay waste to the Earth they handily wait till Doctor Strange and his friends bring back all our favourite lost heroes one at a time!!! Queue a huge CGI fest which will no doubt please action lovers everywhere. It is fun but really somethings are beyond reason. Captain America can now control Thor's hammer and Captain Marvel can come late to the party and destroy a huge spaceship in a matter of seconds but can't defeat Thanos??!! Luckily fate works that our heroes win and Thanos and his army are defeated but at a price.My worry going into this movie was that we would just get a snap, and everyone lives happily ever after and whilst we get the snap the film did give us a price to pay so can I complain no? I have to say the ending for Steve Rodgers was fantastic and well thought out (although still given the time travel issues it does leave big questions) and well deserved.Is it the best movie ever no, is it fun and does it leave us with an adequate ending to the saga yes. Given some very clever work as well to tap into previous movies I think we can give it 8/10. I would have liked more action and less despair and slowness during the first half, but you can't get everything you want. However, if we get Asgardians of the Galaxy in the near future then I will get what I want......come on Marvel that's what all the fans would love. Make our day!!!",positive
From the beginning to end the characters are very alive and at the beginning we never going to believe that is gonna happened but it does and after that the movie been a roller coaster and the climax is the generator of goosebumps and at end for me its a pain to dilute the truth. Over all its an perfect ending to the greatest franchise in marvel universe.,positive
"Perfect , perfect ...
the end of our heros 😢😢😢
i am crying i can not help it . Now my anothe life is ended . I stayed there with them and i am so happy for being there .😢☺",positive
"My First movie review ever and thats because I love Marvel absolutely love it to core and the expectations I had from this movie were just way too much, and after watching I am so disappointed.
Infinity wars was just so much better, End Game has way too many plot holes and some very lazy writing.
I wish I liked it after such a long wait but unfortunately I just couldnt",positive
"Definitely not as good as its predecessor but one to be conjured with nevertheless.
The movie starts a bit slower than all MCU movies before it and it takes its precious time to get the action going, but once it does, its all forgiven and forgotten.
Although predictable, because let's face it, where could they go after Infinity Wars? It delivers on all fronts!
There were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and Hawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who found a peaceful way to co-exist.
There were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who actually didn't have to say a single word to get the tears flowing.
They tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all the glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a forgettable performance.
There are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots. Although it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.All considered, a very good movie to end it all, one that you may want to watch it again to take it all in as I will be doing. Well done to all involved and a great big thank you for such a ride that spanned for over 10 years.",positive
"The first half felt sappy and chatty. I found myself fighting the Zzzz in this first half. But the second half felt like a time travel thriller (a la mission impossible team). The climax with the actual battle was good, like epic battles we have seen before from the Marvel Universe. I was disappointed that there wasn't an end scene. I have grown accustomed to expect an end scene leading up to a new Marvel movie so I felt jipped watching the ending credits and not seeing an end scene. I think it's like a 6 3/4 out of 10 and I rounded it up to 7/10",positive
What a horrible way to end. A waste of 11 years. So sad.,negative
Part 1 of the 2 final movies was perfect. Character development was still going forward. Endgame is nothing but a screen full of the characters we have come to know and love. It tried to tell too much so what we ended up with was clips and a lot of jumping around. It was like a movie made up of movie preview clips. What a let down after all these years.,positive
"Thanos (Josh Brolin) snapped his fingers while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet, and half of all life in the universe disappeared. That's how last year's Avengers: Infinity War ended and left us craving for its epic conclusion.One year later, we are finally in the Endgame. The Russo Brothers filmed this arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe back to back and reminds us of the ""snap"", as we sit down to witness what's coming. Unaware of the battle happening in Wakanda, a family is in for a surprise that will have some serious consequences. Not just for them, but for the entire universe that doesn't know how to move on.The surviving Avengers - Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle) plus brand new members Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and marvellous Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) set off on a mission to stop Thanos once and for all. Will they find Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) in time to join them on this quest? And if so, what if it all fails in the end and make things even worse?11 years and 21 films have been leading up to this chapter. Avengers: Endgame says farewell to characters that have been part of our lives for such a long time, tears are inevitable. Emotions will peak, because movie fans have sat in the backseat for such a long time and got to know these heroes as if we're part of the team. Plots will be wrapped up (even some continuity errors are being corrected, to make sure everything is correct). Everything is at stake and there is only one solution. This is it.Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's script knows just how to find that balance between science, drama and action. These guys know what they're doing and find the heart in the midst of all the heroism. The battle of Wakanda was just a warm up - you ain't seen nothing yet! The Avengers and all of their friends get enough screentime to be remembered with honour or to leave an everlasting mark on all of us. Our superheroes have some extra tricks up their sleeves to keep things exciting. Every one of them gets a moment to shine and the clash we witness in the third act of Endgame is one of the most perfectly constructed and visually mesmerising war scenes you will witness - maybe, EVER! There will be laughs, you will cheer and gasp and you will definitely cry.After Endgame, there's a whole new saga to start and an entire universe to explore. But for now, let's just enjoy the finale to our Infinity Saga and take one last bow to salute them. Thank you Avengers. We love you 3000!",positive
I am a huge fan of marvel. And I was pretty sure that this movie will be legend. And to me it is LEGEND.Scenes was awesome. The scenario was awesome.I think every marvel fan should watch this movie...,positive
"Given the hype and the huge buildup to the opening of this movie, I wouldn't have expected any less of a reaction than what I find on these review boards. And to be fair, the film does encompass and bring to a finale a massive story line with a virtually complete cast of characters that form the Marvel Comics Universe. However a little bit of objectivity is in order, and the movie's current standing after three days of release (as I write this) is just a bit hard to fathom. At number five on IMDb's list of Top Rated Movies, I can only shake my head. Think of your absolutely favorite movie of all time, (unless this one is it), and ""Avengers: Endgame"" has just surpassed it. This is a pet peeve of mine and I've written about it before in my reviews, so I don't want to get carried away here. Suffice it to say that for me, any brand new release to achieve such a ranking isn't really a reflection to how good it is, but a response by the majority of fans who come to these pages to give it a top rating.So rather than being a complete killjoy, I thought the movie was good for what it was, but it took quite a stretch to bring back the characters who went missing following Infinity War. The plot utilizes the time worn (no pun intended), time travel gimmick to hurl the principal heroes back to three (or four) different pasts in order to undo the havoc created by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his destructive use of the Infinity Stones. For once, one of the characters, can't remember who it was, stated that going into the past is really creating a new future, so that the present reality eventually becomes the past. I liked that because if you think it through, that's exactly correct. But in so doing, a whole lot gets muddled as the story progresses, and the idea that Thanos 'used the stones to destroy the stones' makes everything that follows feel like the writers making it up as they went along. Which of course, is what they did, but you know what I mean.There are a lot of huh? moments in the picture - fat Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is one - why? Thor cutting off Thanos's head another - too easy, why not any time prior? Stuff like that demeans credibility and took me out of the picture for a moment. Captain America (Chris Evans) battling himself? Doctor Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch) circular reasoning - ""If I tell you what happens, it won't happen"". Enough stuff like this makes it all a bit muddled to follow, especially when things reach a fever pitch and the last hour descends into a gigantic free for all.But there were interesting elements in the picture. I liked what the writers did with the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), even if he didn't go into 'Smash' mode much. The fully functioning time/space GPS conjured up by Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) was kind of nifty, Elon Musk will probably start working on that any day now. I take with a few grains of salt that Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) died at the end, because, you know, no one dies in the comic book world and lives to tell about it. See, I could be a film writer too. Best of all, I'm glad the film makers got a chance to insert Stan Lee into that 1970 time line scene, because he's my favorite Marvel character, and even though he's not around any more, he'll live on as a result of all his story writing and Marvel movie appearances.In summation, by all means, see the movie, but keep things in perspective. I may see things differently after watching it a second or third time, but right now, my initial reaction is tempered with some reservation. It didn't help that there was no after credits scene, but I guess that was the point. What comes next is anybody's guess.",positive
"Endgame is a fan based movie, only MCU fans gonna like it. This movie is the greatest superhero fantasy movie, a perfect ending for generation. There is lots of goosebumps moments, lots of oh my God moments, wtf moments. Especially the last 30 minutes you will see the greatest Cinematic war,some upsets for fans.
Avengers endgame will be remembered as one of the greatest movie.",positive
"Just to give you some advice anyone who is thinking about seeing this film they need to watch the past Avenger films from the start.The storyline might be a little bit of getting used to but overall it is still a great plot for a Avengers film. After the end of Infinity War it was good to see how the characters had moved on and how the world is picking up the pieces of what had happened. When the sh*t goes down in terms of the action it really is on par and in some aspects beats Infinity War in terms of the diversity and the use of what each character is shown to do.
Overall a solid Avengers Film",positive
"What a waste of a film. The first hour was totallly wasted. Yes there were good bits in it, but a stupid story with a boring script couldn't save this.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame will initially leave you with a 10/10 impression, but it isn't long before the gaping plot holes come to light upon reflection of the 3 hour blockbuster. My eyes actually rolled in the cinema when Scott Lang delivered his line ""yeah, like a time machine"". I knew straight away no matter how entertaining the rest of Endgame was, from here on in I would be picking holes in the plot at every turn. Then Tony Stark goes onto solve the time travel equation or whatever in about 10 seconds of screen time (I know he's a super genius but come on) and our heroes jump down the quantum tunnel to complete their time heist, which I'll admit is a pretty cool concept.Endgame time travel rules are quite different to laws familiar to viewers from other franchises. Firstly the popular ""butterfly effect"" (best represented in Back to the Future) isn't in play here, and time loops such as the ones created in Prisoner of Azkaban are not possible either. Tilda Swinton's The Ancient One best describes the Endgame rules of time travel, which are based on the real life ""many worlds theory"", whereby changing something in the past does not affect the future but simply creates a new timeline - essentially a parallel universe. For the most part this logic holds up pretty well for the plot of Endgame, until Steve Rodgers turns up on that bench right at the film's close and has you questioning everything you thought you understood about the multiverse theory. It makes for a gaping plot hole that I can't seem to find a way around. Nonetheless the writers do well in not creating too many other time travel related plot snags (although if Gamora somehow shows up in future Guardians of the Galaxy instalments it better be well explained or I'll be pissed).Time travel aside, Avengers: Endgame is every bit as entertaining as Infinity War, with nonstop fan service and more emotion than I thought possible from the superhero genre. I got genuine goosebumps at that shot of our heroes walking in almost slow motion towards the quantum tunnel, rivalled only by the goosebumps experienced upon the whole team emerging through portals and reuniting for the final battle. A couple of major character deaths had my eyes stinging as well, while I don't think a single joke fell flat. Everything is rounded off nicely by some breathtaking final credits, and just like that the epic Avengers saga is over forever. What an incredible journey it has been - the likes of we may never see again.",positive
"A bit like a compilation album, some really great tracks but generally just filler. Cinematically it was epic, spectacular, CGI filled superhero awesomeness but the film was slow to start (after a brilliant emotional first 15 mins) and I was mostly underwhelmed by the plot. I felt Thor was ruined by the joke and some parts were just cameos for the sake of it. I did sob with my son at the saddest part, but I still feel a bit... meh.... maybe I need to watch it again to see if it's better second time around!",positive
"Constant stupid jokes, annoying cgi, fake deaths, predictable outcomes, product placement, no sense of danger, self indulgent ending, idiotic fan service, brainless action, and cliche-ridden idiocy is the best way to describe this film. It is fast food for the brain. If you want to take your kids to a fun movie, skip endgame, take them to Ford vs Ferrari. It may be just as sad at times, but it is based off a true story and has great acting, intelligent humor, a fantastic script, and heartwarming moments. It is enjoyable for everyone, and it doesn't have to be as idiotic as this trash to get people to enjoy it. Scorsese is right.",negative
"Many difficulties and troubles will be before us, just like in the movie, the heroes that the heroes will face are like the giant Goliath standing before David. We must move forward fearlessly, because we have no room for retreat. Retreat is compromise, we can only accept life that makes us uncomfortable. If the surviving superheroes don't go to kill me, can they? Of course, the world is not dead. Half of the people are still alive. The living good can rebuild their homes and the social system. The living bad can continue to do evil and do bad things. The living heroes only need to guard the rest of the world. It's not impossible. Just as we have chosen compromise and concession in our lives, a little less money and more work to accept the world. Or, if you don't accept it, go for your own inner world, go for a fight, and go to the blog once.",positive
"It sounds like a cliche, but the hype for Avengers Endgame was unprecedented. After 22 movies, a cliffhanger which saw half the universe destroyed and one of the best marketing campaigns of all time, which told us nothing about what to expect from the film (which made it impossible to write a review without spoilers), this really was a cinematic event.Picking up from the apocalyptic finale of Infinity War, it begins with the remaining Avengers still reeling from the loss of half their friends. Some like Natasha and Steve try are doing all they can to keep things afloat and maintain order in a world in disarray following the snap. Others like Stark try to build a new life from the ashes. But they are unable to escape their own feelings of failure and the film does not avoid showing how much their loss has weighed upon each of them. Especially in early scenes where we see Stark have a complete psychotic breakdown in some of the franchises most powerful scenes. Thus when Scott Lang returns with a plan to go back in time to bring everyone back, they are all willing to do whatever it takes to undo the snap.Whilst Infinity War was Thanos' movie, he doesn't get as much prominence this time around only appearing briefly in the first 20 minutes of the film and not really re-entering the film until the climax. Instead this time our focus is almost entirely on the remaining Avengers and their attempts to bring the other half of humanity back from annihilation by travelling back in time to past movies to retrieve the infinity stones and undo the snap.We get some truly satisfying conclusions to the stories of some of Marvel's biggest characters. Stark finally concludes his journey from being a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist to being the one to make the sacrifice play to protect those he cares about. Plus we finally get to see Rogers learn to live for himself in a bittersweet ending that sees him finally grow old with his true love. It's strange to see two of the most beloved heroes leaving the series, but at the same time with the massive roster of heroes this series has built there will be a lot of great potential in future films to fill their shoes.Although even with its three hour runtime, Endgame contains too many characters to do all of them justice. The main casualty of this being the Hulk. The previous films suggested that we would be seeing more of Banner's Jekyll and Hyde tale, but when we're reintroduced to him here, he's learned to come to terms with the Hulk whilst off-screen and now has the intellect of Banner whilst maintaining the power of the Hulk. Whilst the Banner/Hulk hybrid does have a lot of funny moments, its disappointing that we never see how Banner finally comes to terms with being the Hulk. Instead it seems like this iteration of the Hulk will never reach the full potential of the character.But having a few characters being underutilised is almost a certainty in a film where the main cast includes 54 names. And the film is still able to have a lot of satisfying cameos from fan favourites like Korg to moments with genuine emotional resonance like Stark being able to see his father again and tell him about the granddaughter he could never meet. Even characters that I didn't think I cared about seeing again like the Ancient One end up getting some scene stealing moments.With so many names in one film, we were all waiting in anticipation of the reveal following the second snap and the film did not disappoint. Just like that original shot in the battle of New York where we finally see the Avengers all together for the first time, the moment where all the Avengers assembled (we finally got the line!) to take down Thanos together is the kind of thing that will go down as one of those great cinematic moments. And it really shows just how far this cinematic universe has gone that something as ridiculous as an army of wizards, Asgardians, space bandits and tribal warriors wielding spears, can all arrive to battle a purple alien hell bent on destroying the universe somehow makes perfect sense.Though the actual climax itself felt somewhat mixed overall. There are some great moments like Captain America finally wielding Mljonir and Thanos completely wrecking every member of the Avengers he comes across. But a lot of the confrontations with Thanos' army are fairly underwhelming and there's nothing that lives up to the battle against Thanos on Titan. Plus there is one moment where the film seems to stop to have all its female heroes in one shot. This felt like an attempt to hit back criticisms of their lack of female heroes, when in reality it only highlights that the problem by reminding us of how only one of these characters got their own film. It's not as great as the seeing the time heists that came before it, but this final battle still provides satisfying conclusion.This is definitely a film that is truly made for the fans who have been following this universe grow over the past decade filled with call backs to some of the franchises best moments. At times Avengers Endgame feels like the entire MCU is doing it's own victory lap and after 22 films it's well earned. Now the only lingering question is what's next? Following Disney's acquisition of Fox perhaps we should expect the X-Men and the Fantastic Four joining the MCU in the near future. But whatever they do, it seems unlikely that Marvels dominance is going to come to an end anytime soon.",positive
"""Part of the journey is the end"" - Tony Stark. I was not ready for the end. This movie made me feel those emotions no superhero movie has made me feel before, it even tops the non-superhero movies. I was speechless, teary-eyed, and worried after watching the movie. I am worried and sad because I know that it will never be the same again and I can't digest this fact.",positive
"I hope everyone appreciates this movie for the piece of art it is. Everything that has happened in the MCU (22 movies) mattered. This movie blended all of the storylines into one arc beautifully. It has a perfect blend of drama and well timed comedic moments. Every character has a chance to shine and the cast delivered at every chance. It has a perfect ending.
Of course the Disney/marvel machine will roll on. They are printing money at this point. But let's all take a while and appreciate the work of the entire team that made this happen for fans. I grew up wondering if I'd ever see this material on a big screen. I feel like a kid watching these movies and I'll always love them for that.So please, avoid the spoilers and see this for yourself. Enjoy it now and forever.",positive

"Pros:
top notch cinematic, over the top action, nice concept of time travel.Cons:
chaotic scenes with so many characters, forced cringe moments.",positive
"Even before trailer and movie was released, I already figured it out. That they'll go back in time and save everyone. Overall movie is a good one time watch but not worth that much of hype. For no reason they killed two of the heroes especially iron man.",positive
"This movie picks up after the devestating events of infinity War that wiped out half of all living creatures.
In this movie you can really feel a sense of urgency from the avengers. And the way the characters are taken is all very pleasing. The acting is some of the best in an avengers film. The 3 hour run time is not a problem what's ever and I could've happily sat watching it for 5 or even 6 hours without feeling it dragging on.",positive
"I'm coming at this as someone who read the comics and who also invested in this franchise since 2008 as a 15 year old kid, when I was the only one in my entire high school or inner circle who could comprehend what was about to unfold and told everyone about who The Avengers were and what they're all about.To be frank, time traveling is a lazy way to rewrite or undo everything that came before. But, there are films that do it well and I was going in with that optimism that they might try something clever. Ultimately it is the same time traveling mumbo-jumbo. It does try to cover the tried trope with moments of nostalgia, and to it's credit it even made me feel that way.But with that being said, that wasn't the biggest issue, it was some of the character decisions that the Russos, Feige and writers Markus & McFeely chose. I cannot review this without spoilers, so here it goes.I really disliked Thor's arc. I didn't appreciate the joke they made him into. It just didn't work for me. I've elaborated many times, more often than not the MCU's child-like and formulaic humor can really get on my nerves. I was expecting a tone just a little more dower, similar to Infinity War. I like it when things are taken a little more seriously which is why I put Infinity War, Civil War, The Winter Soldier, and the first Iron Man on such high pedestal. Seeing him out of shape and acting like a frat-boy was unpleasant. Odin's lesson of being there for his people has been lost with Thor's ending, it's as if all the growth in Ragnarok was gone in this film.As for Captain America, well, I did find it kinda fitting, but I would have preferred to have seen Rogers make the ultimate sacrifice himself alongside Tony Stark. The universe revolves around both of them and I personally would have found it more poetic if the two heartbeats of the MCU go out in heroic fashion. Ultron once called him out on ""pretending to live without war."" As much as I found Ultron to be a tad underwhelming, I found that quote from him to have poignancy and also one of the reasons why Captain America is so interesting. Tony Stark, can't help himself but to always fix things, with Steve Rogers, he cannot turn away from any situation that goes south. Even if time traveling in this film apparently splits off to another parallel timeline, I still don't find it in Steve Rogers who gave up his own love, his own time to the greater good, to only check out and retire like the way he did.I had no problem with Tony's death, as a matter of fact I love the fact that Endgame wasn't afraid to kill Black Widow and Iron Man. The MCU started with Downey's Iron Man, so I found it reasonable that it should end with him. Nat's death only develops Hawkeye, who has way more to do in this film than he ever did in the previous installments. It was time for the MCU to not have any ""fake-outs"" and really show that heroes can die. I remember what Whedon said during his tenure with Marvel. It's war, and in war people die, and when the war is won, there is always a cost in a victory.Thanos this time around got the short end of the stick. Brolin again delivers on his performance, and I understand, this movie is more about the Avengers than it is about Thanos, but I just did not like the fact that they killed him in the first twenty minutes and we got a pre-Infinity War Thanos.But, the Big Three, Downey Jr, Evans and Hemsworth deliver. The rest of the cast is good. Jeremy Renner is at his best here like I previously mentioned. Johansson is also very good, and it was nice to see her and Renner's characters bounce off each other like they used to, making her death only more tragic. Karen Gillan who salvaged a small portion of the redundant Guardians 2, also brings her A-game and Nebula's arc here is handled very well. It was also very cool to see Professor Hulk and Ruffalo does a great job being at peace with himself. The rest of the cast, Larson, Cheadle, Rudd, and Cooper are great.Now, we all knew the dusted would return, and that scene really gave me goosebumps momentarily. The action in this film is not on the level of Infinity War. It's solid action, and some very cool moments, but it pales in comparison to the Titan fight, the Wakanda battle, and the opening NY fight in Infinity War. Thanos does however go against the Big Three and that was a treat, especially his fight against Cap, but the rest of the action lacked the extra flare that made the fight sequences in Infinity War so awesome. At the very least, the characters are used well. VFX is also top notch.Ultimately, I enjoyed good amount of moments within the film, and technically speaking it's very well made, but I walked out of this unfulfilled and unsatisfied. I'm not comfortable with the direction they took, especially on the characters I mentioned and I know putting people up to my standards is ridiculous, but I can have high expectations for this because again, I've invested in the MCU for 10+ years. I'll need time to let it sink in and maybe if I watch it again I'll think differently, but its as if the Russos and Markus & McFeely exhausted all options and ran out of gas after delivering film after film.7/10",positive

"If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, ""Excelsior!""",positive

The last hour, with the battle and all the events, it trully become really good. So, a 7 for hour 1 and 2, and a strong 9 for the last.",positive
"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great. There were some very epic moments and some very sad moments. However, it was way too long. Without getting into spoilers, I found myself pretty bored within the first hour.80% of EndGame was really just a fan service/tribute to the MCU fans who watched all the previous MCU titles (most of which I saw). Even after the ~30 mins climatic battle (which was the best part of the film), however, the movie somehow continues to drag itself on again.I also felt there were some plot holes in the story/concepts; I had trouble understanding how it all worked.The humor was alright, but it is of typical MCU-grade comedy. Again, some jokes were good, while other jokes were just dragged on or plain cheesy.Overall I liked Infinity War better",positive
"I am a huge Marvel fan and have loved the previous Avengers films so went with high Hope's for this, unfortunately I was disappointed beyond belief. Long, slow, dull scences make up most of the movie with only about 10 minutes of actual action. Main characters are sidetracked for less popular ones and the whole film moves at a snail's pace. It really felt like they had run out of ideas and this is just a money making film. So, so let down and would not recommend.. recommend it to anyone",negative

"Darn, that was emotional at the end.Time travel is a convenient device in story telling to give fans nostalgic scenes and a chance to reuse old-loved characters. It is a bit of a plot-convenient tool, however. But I enjoyed it.Thanos was killed so easily in the beginning of the movie. I was a bit disappointed a first but in the end it was clear where this movie had to be headed towards. An all-out fight involving (almost) all Avengers against Thanos, and ultimately that's what it came down to.Of course, it had to end with ""I am Iron Man"" and with that we have seen the conclusion of an epic franchise - of the Avengers as we have known it since.The old team has finally found closure and so many threats to the universe have been aversed. That was a deserved ending for the Endgame.Btw, what is Gamora doing now? And why didn't spiderman's friends grow up? There remain plot holes and questions but these will have to wait for a new generation of the Avengers.",positive
"It is awe-inspiring, soul-crushing and ever-surprising. I seriously don't think they could've crafted a finer conclusion.",positive
"I was a little late watching this one and had heard a lot of mixed reviews leading up to doing so; however, I personally thought this was the best possible conclusion to the current Avengers storyline. Or... the conclusion for now at least.First of all, I really enjoyed getting to see a more human side of all the Avengers in this one. I thought the film makers did an amazing job at really giving us the time to connect with each and every super hero in this franchise if we hadn't thus far. Doing so really helped set the stage for the ""Endgame"", if you will. I really enjoyed the main characters throughout this film as well. I thought Thanos had wiped out the majority of my favorites with his infinity stone snap, but I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed the remaining characters and how well they worked together throughout the film.Also, I just can't say enough about how beautiful the Marvel films are and how well the CGI, costumes, and FX are done. For a film series that relies so heavily on FX and CGI, they manage to pull it off so smoothly and seamlessly.It's hard to go too far with a review without giving away any of the storyline; however, I feel that any true fan has already seen the film at this point. For those who haven't I can only say to come out from under the rock you're living under and check out this amazing piece of cinema history.I give Avengers: Endgame a 9 out of 10!!!PS - Captain Marvel is soooooo badass!!!!",positive
"One thing I did before seeing endgame was to avoid all teaser and trailers and spoilers. With that said, I had no idea about what I am going in to see apart from what I had imagined in my mind as to what's going to happen next and I can tell you that most of what I had thought really did not happen that way. I would advise to watch a recap of MCU on YouTube and do watch Infinity War once more to refresh your memory. Just like infinity war, the movie starts right off the bat, moving story forward in a well paced manner. Since movie is three hours long they divided the movie into three sections, all sections well used:1. Gather the avengers
2. Make and execute the plan
3. Final battleThe movie is so well paced that the three hours just went by and there is not a single moment where you will lose your interest or get bored. The best part about the movie is the way how the past Marvel movies are connected to this one will be a surprise treat for you. Marvel has done justice to bring Thanos to big screen and given him two movie to fully show what he actually is capable of doing. He is no joke and you will see it in the later part of the movie. He is the baddest villain and the final battle has proved it.This movie was not all about action, as a matter of fact only last part of the movie is action yet still the movie manages to hold its audiences with a bunch of surprises and to the edge of their seat during final battle. The mission are also going to keep you tight on your seat. The movie is full of humor thanks to Rocket and Thor and Iron man. Surprisingly Hulk has some great comic moments as well.At the end the movie pays homage to previous marvel movies and their characters whose story ends with Endgame however they could be back anytime if Marvel wants them to. This is one in a life time movie that you will remember. Don't miss it and watch it in theater.",positive
"Avengers Endgame delivers something that is beyond imagination, something is fantasy of every comic book nerd or a cinephile. With extraordinary visual effects, brilliant story telling and top notch acting, avengers endgame delivers a near perfect end to a near perfect saga. the movie delivers every checklist of y nerd fantasy. The final act is the most mesmerizing pay off i have seen in the last decades.",positive
"I've grown up with the MCU with Iron Man coming out when I was 5 years old. I love this series and it's sad that the main saga is over but I expected a bit more. I gave Infinity War a 9/10 because of its amazing pace, fun characters and unexpected gut-wrenching ending, but this film has sluggish and inconsistent pacing, ruined character arcs (like Hulk as in IW he was afraid to even show himself but now they sorted everything out... Off screen), and a very predictable story and ending. I'm not even joking when I say that (even though my prediction was slightly different) my prediction to the film was extremely accurate to the films events.To conclude, I watched Infinity War 3 times in cinemas and who knows how many times on Blu-Ray, but I've only seen Endgame once and have no intention of seeing it again anytime soon: I liked it, but was overall disappointed.",positive
"This movie was meant to be watched in an IMAX theater, especially because the sound makes up a very important part of the movie. To be honest, there were times when I felt that this movie is definitely 3 hours, but I can see why it was so necessary. This movie truly delivers what it promises it would! This movie really marks an important era in cinema.",positive
"To describe it in one word - BORING. No real emotional pull from the vanishing in infinity war and any attempt to, was handled poorly. The opening Hawkeye scene a perfect example The first 45 minutes really plods.The main plot, when we finally get to it, might leave you cringing as will the character assassination of Thor and Hulk - silliness taken a step too far.
Some huge inconsistencies in the story too that really irked me, like one throw of the Storm-breaker piercing Thanos despite wearing the gauntlet in infinity, to being powerless to stop him when he is without the gauntlet?!!! And the ending, why didn't they use the time stone to stop the invasion and ensure no avengers die?!!! And how come Hawkeye could handle an infinity stone when it nearly shredded all the guardians in vol 1?!! The end fight scene was boring and poorly choreographed. Overall, I think the russo's ran out of ideas and were overwhelmed with the task of bringing the various storylines and characters together. A shame it ended so shambolically, I had hoped and expected so much more.",positive
"I hate how people are saying that this movie is epic, and that all the movies that preceded it were epic as well. There have only been a handful of Marvel movies that have actually been good, and this is not one of them.Marvel, like The Simpsons, has run out of ideas and is now running off of a therom. If it has the word marvel in it, then it will sell. The story does not matter only the name, and it's finally starting to show, as it has for The Simpsons for years now. And the announcement of new movies is now no longer exciting for me.Marvel honestly needs to take a step back and take their time in producing movies, as well as shows now too, like some of their most fantastic movies and shows, like the original Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and even the Netflix Daredevil, which was surprisingly good and did a great job portraying the character. What the executives at Marvel don't seem to understand is that they in fact are not Epic, they're just putting trash out and unfortunately the masses are gobbling it up. Things become like goats, they'll eat anything that you put in front of them.End game is one of the most unimpressive movies I've seen in a very long time. I cannot believe that I wasted almost four hours of my life watching this horrible, sad excuse for a superhero movie, if you could even call it that. The only great thing about the past few Marvel movies is the memes that have come out of it. The Russo Brothers Legacy will be the memes that were made from their movies, not the story itself nor the movies. Just because you have the lucasfilm lighting, as well as the CGI company behind you does not make you amazing. What makes anything amazing, story-wise is a good story. End game doesn't even have that! They paid Robert Downey jr. 75 million dollars for the only good scene in the entire film, and it only lasts a couple of seconds. What a waste of money.For the love of God stop going to see Marvel movies and teach them a lesson to stop making horrible movies they aren't even superhero movies anymore. Stan Lee is gone, even when he was alive he didn't stop these terrible movies from being made, because he believed in Marvel and that it could change the world. In the beginning it did, with the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man's, Iron Man, and all of these amazing Marvel films that were actually well done and good. Stan Lee near the end, just produced these films because that's all that he knew to do. He inherently trusted these people to make great movies, and honestly they failed him and failed the original image of Marvel. Only the comics have stayed true, and even then they've come to PC for my liking, and it's so sad. Marvel won't be getting any more of my money. Hopefully you won't be giving any of yours to them anymore either. I am tired",negative
T was a good movie but the beginning was kinda boring so I didn't really enjoy watching the first hour but the ending WAS THE BEST,positive
"I love the movie, i just hate that some questions are floping into my head after watching this movie:
1) Since they can bring back 2014's Thanos, Gamora and (twin) Nebula, why don't they just travel the time and bring back alive Nat and Tony? Hulk said the past isn't your future right?
2) Gamora is the victim of the soul stone exchange but proof can be bring back, why not black widow??
3) 2014's Thanos has been killed, so the timeline wil change after the civil war? Why the needs to bring back all the stone by captain America then?
4) How can Thanos shrink his giant starship with only one tiny prim material??? Isn't tranporting one man must wearing a custom shrink suit??
Confused.....",positive
"Well, I never thought I would be in a movie theatre where men and woman were crying in a superhero movie, but it happened.
Robert Downey gave his best performance to date imho.
Cheering, laughing, crying, and a good old fashioned round of applause at the end, says it all. A very good movie, I scored 8.5. I would definitely go and see it again, after I did I might give it a 9.
Fitting finale to a fantastic franchise",positive
Can't complain. Loved the movie. Lots of action and story lines. A lot to keep up with but things tie together nicely. Worth the wait.,positive
"Woah!...what can I say? This is the movie event of the year, if not this decade! It Caps (pardon the pun) of 11 years of MCU joy and sends some characters out with a bang! Literally EVERYONE thats ever been in a Marvel movie is in this thing.
It is absolutely hilarious in places, with standout comedy performances going to Thor and Hulk, who had me cracking up, Thor especially with his 'new look' lol
It was as I expected it to be for the first act, slow going and moody, with a massive sense of loss after the 'snap' with wiped out half the universe.
But you dont care, your just reeling from these characters who have lost so much, and feeling their pain. They lost big time! And they know it!
It's very unexpected in one aspect though, as you'll see, when they catch up with a certain villain very early on, and your like..woah..ok!?I'm not gonna harp on, just gonna say you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be thrilled and entertained for 3hrs and a minute. I need to go and see it at least twice more to fully take it in, as I'm still reeling from the midnight screening.Bravo to the Russo bros, I take my hat of to you both and say thank you for a movie event I'll remember for a long time to come. Take a bow guys, you deserve it soooo much.",positive
"First like 20 minutes, just wow. Then for like hour and the half it's bringing back old memories, just great. And that last battle for the end, gave everyone chills. I really liked that they showed that Thanos is super strong even without the gaunlet. Great humor as well. Only downside is timeline, I don't know what they did with that.
Btw Hulk, Antman and Thor were amazing. And for the end, thanks for everything Tony and Steve :)",positive
"I'm not disappointed bcz of its sad ending, it's just the problem I have with some parts of the film.
where went the romance between Bruce and Nat. when there comes some thing like a feeling in the scripts, the audience expect to see the expansion of it. but here this part totally became forgotten!when Cap went to the past to return the stones, where he put the Soul Stone?! it's not clear how he returned it! gave it to Red Skull? not logical!Cap left the Avengers Team for Peggy? he didn't seem that kind of guy before! he mourned for Peggy and had it in his mind as a good memory, but then he left the team for her and that's a big irresponsibility that we never saw in him before.was it really essential to ruin the Mighty Thor to this level? what help gave his new appearance and behavior to the movie line? just to prevent him wear the gauntlet?why Tony and Nebula who were aware of the way the Soul Stone can be achieved( by knowing that Thanos achieved it by murdering Gamora) didn't say anything about it when the team was doing some researches about the stones? is it logical?",positive
"The avengers go out with a bang in this movie. It's fun, it's emotional, it's action packed, it has surprises, it does the ending of the avengers movies justice. It starts out slower but it's all worth it for the end. It had moments where people cried, clapped and gasped. Go see it!",positive
"This I had to see...But oh well, must be all those die-hard Marvel fanboys at it again.Lot's of CGI, green screen and jokes in this SOAP OPERA with way too many characters. And yes, here comes the CGI villain again.It wasn't for me.Captain America: Winter Soldier is still the best Marvel movie.",positive
Firstly I'm a big film buff. I watch on average one film per day crossing genres and countries. I watched the first two hours then turned this movie off and went to bed. Seriously two hours to cover what should only take about 40 to 50 mins. Normally films have twenty minutes to set the story and introduce the characters. This film spends one hour reintroducing characters from the other movies then the characters decide what to do. Then another hour of idle chit chat. This movie is full of itself. I'm so glad I didn't bother going to the cinema to watch this. I'm sure there was going to be some action at some point but I ran out of patience.,negative
Hands off to the last of MCU movies. This whole storyline was a masterpiece. I am going to see these movies again and again and again I will never stop. Thank you Marvel,positive
"I wish I could rate 100/10. Wow, and seriously wow....!!! This is probably first time I have cried in a movie theatre.",positive
"I laughed I cried, I shouted at one point. I had my head in my hands. I had my hands in the air. I went back to the box office and booked again.One word...... special.See it to believe it, a masterclass in film making. And the perfect close to a decade of entertainment and a year of obsession and theorizing (and STILL being off the Mark.)",positive
The cgi is awesome and the action in intense. But it's sad to see Tony die at the end,positive
"I love superhero movies. So consider this a genre I truly enjoy and I review this title considering it's not art; it's entertainment. And in that sense, it's emotional, exciting, dramatic, action packed with the perfect amount of humor.
It's no wonder it's the most anticipated superhero movie of all times, and no wonder why it has grossed so much. The movie promised to be awesome and was an understatement. If you like superheroes like me, you're gonna love it. Never before had so many heroes appeared together and, finally, working as a team.
Now; to all of the people who expected an art movie, of course you didn't like it. It's an action film with amazing special effects and awesome action scenes and fabulous characters.",positive
"Endgame is probably the best film I have gone to see in cinemas and everyone saying that it's rubbish and boring, then you clearly don't appreciate the MCU in anyway shape or form because it's a fantastic end to the saga.
Also for people who don't get the time travel logic if you kill yourself in the past then that dimension you will be dead but in the dimension you're coming from you stay the same so it only affects that time period you travelled back to.",positive
"*Packed with MANY spoilers*Let's get real. This movie was so massive, but it has sooo many plotholes! Make no mistake I love Marvel, but this movie was not the best that's out there from the MCU. I loved how the movie pays homage to the previous films, I thought that was quite clever. But I personally expected way more action earlier in the movie.Thanos snapped half the universe in IW. But we didn't really get to SEE the direct impact on Earth in this movie. No chaos. No news. Just a ... quiet depressed world? Really? I wanted to feel anxious and feel like all hope is lost but it never really got there. Even during collecting the stones from the previous timelines.The attack on Thanos in the opening scene was lame. This guy was meant to be a massive villain that the MCU has been building up for a decade, and his death was over in minutes. Captain Marvel's lack of screen time didn't make any sense, she's so powerful yet was hardly there. I get that the writers were focusing on the original 6 Avengers but there were scenes where it would have been interesting to see her in. Yes, this is the Avengers fight, but it's also Captain Marvels universe that has been affected, so not seeing her as involved as Ant-Man or Nebula was disappointing. Oh and obtaining the Soul stone... Nebula couldn't warn Black Widow and Hawkeye about what was coming? Seriously?? Not something you want to mention beforehand?How did Thanos's ship time travel without a) starks tech and b) the Pym Particle. HELLO THE SHIP WENT SUB ATOMIC INTO THE QUANTAM REALM AND TIME TRAVELLED. What did the 2014 Nebula do to make this happen? And no one noticed a massive ship come shooting out of the time machine and out of the Avengers base?!When Hulk reverses the snap... again we don't know the impact it had on Earth / the Universe. What actually happened? Was everything reset back to 2019, or were the people that turned to dust returned into a new time (5 years later?) and if so why was Peter back in highschool?? And what about the people that were already on Earth, were they also set back to a time right before everyone dissappeared? I guess we see Cassie (Ant-Man) all grown up at the end, but come on... this was a MASSIVE ISSUE and it was not explained in any way whatsoever. I get they wanted the dramatic entrance of the dusted superheroes, but even after the mega action scene at the end there was no explanation of how half the universe came back into life.The movie also never really showed us as an audience the 1 in 14 million ... chain of events that led to the win. Could anyone else have snapped their fingers and dusted away Thanos and his clan? Again... no proper explanation.Tony stark starting the MCU infinity saga and also ended it, perfect... and giving him the appropriate screen time at the end. What about black widow? Couldn't Hawkeye bring her body back? Couldn't someone else travel to where she was and get her body? They just left her there to die alone?For a 3 hour movie you'd expect more of closing story or better explanations, but instead time was wasted on a slow start to the movie. Nonetheless I still enjoyed this movie and it will come to grow on me more and more, but I'm always going to have these questions in the back of my mind every time I watch.Oh... and don't get me started on the time travel MESS.",positive
"It worth the hype, the movie was simply amazing and it had a strong emotional impact, I was diving from laughing to tension and sadness, but after all it was a great movie! All the 1 star reviews are wired in my opinion, those people just throw away with hate without even watching the whole MCU or just because they didn t understand the hype.",positive
"I cried and laughed and blah, blah, blah. CGI was great, but I can't get past all the subtext to create plot rules and then completley blow them put of the water. I can think of about 5 minutes of scenes and a slightly different way to handle the last moments of the battle that would have covered those holes. I can't believe no one said ""Hang on a minute. This wont work.""",positive
"I'm not a hardcore ""Avengers"" fan. But being a movie fan means I am of course caught up in the buzz around this. Unfortunately I feel this is purely aimed at the mega fans, and I can imagine even some of them being disappointed.It all starts out promising. Setting things up and being as good humoured as usual. But then the time travelling stuff sets in. At first it sounded like this was going to be fun. But as it marched on it felt like way to much was being thrown in there, and the entire story (and a few of the previous movies) seem to get trashed in the chaos. I love time travel movie's if they setup some rules and stick to them. But do alot of contradicting stuff and you lose me.Still. There are a few surprises, and the big finale is still amazing to look at. The Ending does seem fitting, but the stink from the middle part of the movie stays throughout, and i was left scrathcing my head at least a couple of times more with revelations at the end.Oh, and I'm not sure what I think about the hulk in this. He seemed like he was just there for laughs. Unintentional or otherwise.",negative
"I really waited for this movie a whole year and when I watch it for the first time I was really emotional and it is really a nice tribute for the original six and a perfect ending to this past 10 years. I really enjoyed the experience, and I am waiting for more from Marvel and I am excited to see what will they do with these characters.",positive
"This was a great movie and a proper end to the series.Besides some convoluted continuity issues, it was very well done.And the best part of all, minimal screen time for the newest and most widely hated Avenger of the bunch, CM.",positive
"If you are a fan of the mcu you will love this movie even if your not you might still love it, it concludes the story that was being told since 2008 in a satisfying way. It is more than a movie this is an experience especially in theaters",positive
"An emotional climax full of action, humor and time travel. The first part kind of finishes Infinity War storyline by having Thor kill Thanos when the Avengers, together with Captain Marvel, find him in space. The story then jumps 5 years later as the characters deal with the after effects of Infinity War in their before they figure out a way to undo Thanos snap with the aid of Antman and his time travel time theory. The storyline seems to have lots of dialogues but then viewers are quickly rewarded with great action scenes. And Oh My God, the final battle with Thanos(who time travels from the past to the present) and his army is just awesome as you have all the heroes taking a part in the battle. And we also lose some of our favourite characters.",positive
"Just back from the theatre. Positioned myself beside the exit so I could slip out to the bathroom knowing it was just over three hours long, but so much was happening on the screen that I had to cross my legs. Exceptional ending to a fantastic decenium of action. There is no post credits which makes absolute sense so no need to sit through credits if you don't find it interesting.",positive
I mean what is there to say other than wow this movie is just incredible. WOW,positive
"Avengers: Endgame
After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more. After seen it hard to say but Marvel disappointed to not used their greatest villain in the endgame.
The film is about undo the ""SNAP"" that's it! Nothing else. For this, 3 hours is too long to do nothing. beginning of the movie (the Clint part) was so perfect and then couple of minutes was so fast I don't know why they'd cut so many scenes, completely unsatisfied.
The creation of aftermath was good. The middle part of the movie was boring cause they'd spend so much time on some unusual moments, funny moments in very serious situation, time travel plot holes, ruined the most valuable character Thor, Banner and Thanos. So, almost 2 hours I hadn't seen any villain I thought that marvel conclude Thanos's story but they didn't and also, they haven't used all the infinity stones individually. only they'd used for the ""SNAP"".
Last hour of the film. well first 30 minutes overall average cause we know this is the endgame the last film of phase 3 so, I guess it would have been perfect if everyone hadn't come. So, calling everyone's back that ruined everything. And then Tony's Funeral I guess the best sequence in the film.
The character development of the Tony, Captain, and Hawkeye was good. These characters were so special cause of their unique way. Favourite scene sequence was Tony's funeral. Had so much intense. Cinematography and Directing was good then the infinity war but not that much good then the first avengers. Overall wanted more, even far from perfect.
So, I give 6/10 because of,
The movie was too long. And music wasn't interesting.
Poor treatment of Thor, Hulk/Banner.
Completely ruined Thanos.
Re-introduction of vanished Avengers.
Poor screenplay.
Lack of captain marvel.
Time travel plot holes.",positive
"The climax that all fans deserve. Marvel still pulls out surprises that you couldn't dream of, allowing this to earn a spot anongst some of the greatest films made. The length yields an utterly satisfying scene, but honours the 11 years of the studio with the perfect ending.",positive
"For a Marvel movie it was ok, better than most. However this has no place being higher ranked than Schindler's list, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, Every Kubrick movie ever made and many more. People should take of their Marvel fanboy hats and stop shoving these movies to the top. I'm not saying you shouldn't enjoy them, but stop inflating the reviews just based on the fact that you grew up with the characters and judge them on the movie itself.",positive
"333. Avengers: Endgame. After the events of Infinity War, which did not last for infinity, cell phone gamer Thermos got his wish he deleted half his apps on his phone, after collecting all the Bejeweled gems. So what now? Well, those of the game app The Avengers that are left, get mad, so they stroll over to Thermos' place and behead him, rather easily... the excuse is, cause he was worn out and weak after using the stones, yea ok lets go with that. So what now? The End? Right??? No, they're not satisfied with the realization that in war people die, even the good guys, so the answer is: Time Travel. Thus a convoluted plan is born to travel through time, getting the stones back to create the game glove to bring all the dead folks back. So by now I've sure you've seen it, so spoilers be damned and my issue with the ending... The Captain America time line... The movie states, all other time travel movies are wrong, they're rules are right. You jump through to a different time, that is your reality now. So the Avengers plan works, though they screw up each timeline they go to, giving Disney enough material to make alternate universe versions of the same movie forever, oh wait, they do that now... The final act is for the Captain to bring the final stone back, to his original time and come back, to i guess rebuild and get ready for Avengers 5, i dunno. But he decides to stay back then and make a life with his lost lady love, creating his own new timeline, where he still got all muscley apparently, however this would mean that all the events of the MCU did not take place in the Captains new timeline, so when he randomly shows up as an old man to the spot where he left the other timeline, a timeline he ended by leaving it...the events of his life were drastically different and in creating this new time line, the others are null and void because they now exist in an alternate universe where old Steve Rogers does not. If your gonna say all other time travel movies are wrong, at least follow your own rules. Filmbufftim on FB.",negative
"I've been a fan of superheroes since I was little kid. When Iron Man was out, I couldn't believe it, it was so good. But, I completely fell in love with the idea of the MCU when I watched Captain America: The First Avenger.
Here we are, 10 years later, 10 years loving fictional characters, loving the actors, loving the movies, to have it ending like... well this.I think they had a great idea, a great way of saying goodbye to the most beloved characters, but I think the movie fell short. I was more emotional during the ending credits than the whole movie. I felt like I needed more, like there was many things left unsaid. Maybe I'll love it the second time I watched it? I don't know honestly, for now, I am a bit disappointed with this one.",positive
"A movie bigger than this has never been made or attempted. Critics who do not appreciate the movie or say its 'just another superhero movie' take this movie alone. This is NOT a standalone movie, its a closing to a spectacular franchise and it was satisfying on so many levels, I cant even explain.
There were so many moments in the movie that made one appreciate the depth of character, backstory,human bonding, sacrifice and ofcourse comedy and action, that I cannot even point them out even if I wanted to.To enjoy the movie, at least watch most of the MCU movies. This is the movie of the decade and you WILL ENJOY THIS",positive
Gonna keep it simple here.. The movie is awesome.. Some people may say the movie got plotholes here and there but no.. The plotholes are negligible.. And all make senses. Better than Infinity Wars.. And i don't know what future lies ahead after the ending of Endgame. Would it be better with new line? I hope so.. But this movie really sum up all the hard work of 11 years of MCU. Thank You RDJ for starting all of this.,positive
"Greetings from Lithuania.""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) was funny, a bit sad, very entertaining, spectacular and maybe a bit too long for me personally. I did enjoy this movie from start till finish though, and while its not my personal favorite from them all, this was a very solid movie in my opinion (and i'm not a huge fan of these movies to start with, so tears haven't been found during my watch).Overall, ""Avengers: Endgame"" brings half of the Hollywood famous actors into one big, entertaining 3 hours (!) long escapism. At the end i enjoyed this film much more then i thought i will be.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame (5 out of 5 stars).Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent awesome superhero film that concludes the infinity stones storyline that has been building up with 22 movies in the Marvel universe. They had done a great job building up each solo character and have there films bring something new and exciting. Endgame is the game changer that delivers the ultimate climax of the story arc with the big bad Thanos (Josh Brolin) going up against the Avengers. After the previous film Infinity War leaving the audience hanging with the cliffhanger. Marvel has done a great job in marketing and keeping this film spoilers free with the trailers that only show the same footage and very minimum. Which I will say it is best to see the film knowing very little about what is going to happen.I will try to keep this review spoiler free. Endgame is amazing and spectacular. Joe and Anthony Russo direction was fantastic and they did a great job in delivering a spectacular climax of the MCU. The plot was amazing. For a three hour long film. The film does move pretty fast and kind of feels short when watching it. I did feel like Endgame is a little short on the action set pieces like the previous films. Which this film does focus more on the emotional connections with the original Avengers like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and how they were all affected by the aftermath of Infinity War. The film does have a lot of fun and feels like a wild adventure with what these characters go through. The final hour delivers all out with an epic climax which every character has a moment to shine. And makes up for the lack of action in the movie. I love how every hero works with another when fighting there enemy. There were some moments where you will be in an awe and clapping moment with the climatic battle sequence. The visual effects are top notch great. There is some fun humor that will lighten the mood of the film. And there are some tear jerking moments that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. The directors did a wonderful job in surprising the audience with something new and reaching every characters full potential. The climatic fight scene with Thor, Cap America, and Iron Man teaming up and bouncing around with there super powers are just awesome. The surprises do keep on coming throughout. Which will leave you feeling satisfied.Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. The plot was amazing and fast moving. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited. The cast ensemble was great. I will say this is one fun wild ride that I am happy how it ties the story arc together.",positive
"I don't care in how badly that this movie was shot, as I have stated, anything with the Avengers in it, I'm totally on-board.I will admit, it's not one of the best movies, but it gets a 10 rating approval from me. I just hated the way that this one ended by having some of the Avengers disappear into a different universe and having Dr. Strange come and bring them back in a way. Strange indeed.",positive
"I thought that Endgame will blow me away, I was wrong. Infinity Ward was an amazing movie, it got 10 out off stars and it just a flawless masterpiece with no errors just pure art. Endgame is full off meaningless crap like the awful humor with cheesy one liners that just destroys the entire movie. It's not funny please stop it I thought while the movie just keep going with these lame and embarrassing jokes that just bored and got me mad at the movie to the point that I wanted it to end but it never did. Another bad thing is that Endgame is so predictable that its just a joke, you don't even have to watch the movie to know how it ends. But the movie did entertain me and it really got tearing up scenes that left me emotional and great character ark, acting and action scenes, but the problem is that there isn't enough of these elements to save the movie, and what's left is a big letdown. Good dammit.",positive
"Just watched the movie again at home last night. I tought I would not react the same way I did in the theater, but I was wrong. When the avengers assemble my heart was pounding again. Came to think why and figures that for me, this felt the grand finale of a great series, or of a 50+ hours movie. The culmination of a master crafted history. I'm not a marvel or superhero fan, that is why my reaction surprised so much. Just, wow!",positive
"My initial reaction coming out of the theatre was of great satisfaction and little sadness (black widow and iron man deaths). But as I gave more thought to the movie, I felt it could have been taken in a very different direction.The time travel plan was good and I enjoyed the time travel scenes, but left me with a glaring question.....Wouldn't retrieving the stones from the past completely erase the Infinity War timeline as Thanos wouldn't be able to find the stones in the past??.....which means there was no snap and everybody just survived?? Also wouldn't it erase the present timeline of this movie and give rise to an entirely new timeline??In my opinion, 5 years was too much of a gap, instead 1 year at the most would be more appropriate. Two reasons for this: 1. People move on with life in 5 years. 2. 5 years is too much of a time to avenge for the Earths Mightiest Heroes.My other gripe is when Iron man wears his gauntlet with the infinity stones, how can he survive that?? A normal human cannot even survive holding just the power stone by itself. In my opinion it should have been either Captain Marvel or Thor or may be even Captain America (as he's a superhuman) weikding Tony's gauntlet with the infity stones.Overall the movie ends up as a fun movie with great fan service as it touches upon the past movies and characters in a great culmination of 22 movies. I would even watch it multiple times but secretly would wish it was remade with Iron man surviving the end.",positive
"Boring, horrible cartoonish CGI, terrible action scenes. So predictable and does nothing to keep you captivated. Horrible movie.",negative
"No words...absolutely incredible, THE best way to end the whole series. Watching all the movies to finish with this, every single hour was worth it, hats off to Marvel 👏🏽",positive
"Drama 4/5
Action 5/5
Vfx cgi 5/5
Humour 3.5/5
Suspens 3/5",positive
The best MCU movie i've ever seen. And I could not control my sobbing during certain scenes which I am not going to spoil it here just for you guys. You all have to see this!!!!!!! A must watch.,positive
"After 11 years and 22 movies, Marvel Studios brought us the most ambitious movie, the greatest culmination, it is nostalgic, sentimental and completely unexpected. All the characters are so well-balanced, to each one is given plenty of screen time to development. If you're a marvel fan you'll feel like you're finally complete, you've never seen anything like this before, there are many references to all the 22 movies and there is a certain inevitability about the plot, there are plenty surprises. The movie present us an incredible balancing between nostalgia and novelty, you will scream, laugh and cry, it is the Marvel recipe elevated to the highest level. There's just so much in it, that I can't even write about it without spoiling everything. This is not the end for Marvel, but it certainly marks an ending for several of the characters we've watched and loved over the last decade, there will be more superhero franchises but it's hard to imagine any one being so culturally resonant.
It is the grande finale.",positive
"Some scenes could have been cut out and the humor was a bit over the top for me in what should've been a more serious and dark film given the stakes. But everything else was knocked out of the park. Emotionally and action-wise with our favorite heroes, THIS is what the fans have been waiting for going on 11 years. I left the theater twice satisfied.",positive
"One of the best (if not the best) final acts in superhero movies. Russo Bros did it very brilliantly. ""Captain America is Worthy"" scene is one of the best CBM moments of all time. Full marks for that. The final war scene, the digital cinematography, the colors look so beautiful and expensive.Tony Stark/Iron Man is one true hero and leader 'not actually, but you'll see and feel' in the MCU since 2008. Robert Downey Jr. was outstanding in the Endgame. He deserves all the popularity and respect from the fans. His every scene was good.
Captain America comes at number 2. He looks tensed through-out the movie, so does Black Widow, as we all know he knows his responsibilities. He is the man of honor.
Clint Barton/Hawkeye/Ronin comes at number 3. Somehow sometimes I found The Ant-Man's character very serious here. Paul Rudd was amazing as Scott Lang.
Spider-Man was so powerful and impressive in his very limited role.
The Hulk taking Time stone, Clint and Nat's Vormir visit, Tony met his father again, Captain vs Captain, Cap/Tony/Thor fighting Thanos scenes were mind-blowing.The characters disappointed me, are-Captain Marvel. I seriously believe that Russo Bros can make Endgame without her. Never felt her worth in this film. Not in a single scene. Well, They could use Pepper Potts to 'rescue' Tony Stark. Also when she makes an appearance in the final battle, was also useless, we realize that later.
Thor. Thor is a comedian after Ragnarok. I don't know why they did this to him, what's wrong with the ""fun-loving"" studio; although Thor has some very good action scenes, just action scenes.
Hulk. They ruined the Professor Hulk for me. The arc was missing even he had a very big role though. But he was just another comedian.
Black Panther. His one scene was good from his very limited role. I feel that only Russo did justice to his powers as we saw him in Civil War and Infinity War and now this.The characters I wanted to see more, are-
Thanos. He impressed again in the fight scenes and that dialogue before the battle.
Pepper Potts in the Iron suit.
Spider-Man.
Loki.
Nick Fury at the end.Things I didn't like-
This is not how Time-Travel works. They showed it like it is just a children's game. I expected more for Tony's rescue scene, It was pretty disappointing for me. Some scenes in the 1st act looked stretched and unnecessary.
Tony Stark's death could have been more emotional, I felt that scene where he hugs Spider-Man was better than Pepper talking him for the last time. I am a very emotional person but haven't felt much emotion in that scene.
I didn't like the 'after battle scenes' or you can say 'the conclusion scenes' except ""The New Captain America"" scene, that was so powerful and emotional. Captain-Peggy scene could have been better, as the fan-theory says.Well, concluding my view on Endgame by saying ""Go and watch it on the biggest screen possible"". That's it.",positive
"Well, I finally got around to watching ""Avengers: Endgame"", even though I already watched ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"", so I already knew some of the events that were to transpire in ""Avengers: Endgame"". And I am not really fond of the superhero genre, but I still watch the movies when given the chance, as they are usually visually fantastic and provide adequate entertainment. And of course with all the hype that ""Avengers: Endgame"" had gotten, of course I just had to sit down and watch it.First of all, the movie was long. A little bit too long actually. I did feel that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were taking their sweet time getting to the core of the storyline, and just dancing around the bushes. In my opinion, the movie did suffer from this.Visually, well let's just go with 'wow'. Yeah, the movie was phenomenally stunning to look at visually given the CGI and special effects. But of course, being a Marvel movie, then you'd have top of the line special effects. And it is the visuals that carry the superhero movies quite a long way down the road.Story-wise, then I felt that the plot and storyline portrayed in ""Avengers: Endgame"" was a little bit too predictable and too generic. You already knew the movie's outcome when you sat down to watch it. Of course, Marvel weren't going to kill off a heap of their most beloved characters. No chance of that happening. So there weren't really much of any surprises along the way. And the time traveling aspect of the movie? Seriously? That was just downright idiotic.What worked for the movie, aside from the great visuals, was the impressive ensemble of actors and actresses that made an appearance in bigger or smaller parts throughout the course of the movie. Thumbs up for that. However, I found some of the dialogue to be a bit too corny and felt that it was written for a young audience.Was ""Avengers: Endgame"" a fulfilling closure to the Marvel storyline? Hardly so. The movie, while being entertaining enough, felt a bit shallow, with parts of the story quite poorly written. But if you, like me, come to the superhero movies mostly for the special effects, then ""Avengers: Endgame"" will definitely blow you away.All in all, I am rating ""Avengers: Endgame"" a six out of ten stars.",positive
"For the past 11 years MCU has been increasing their fan base across the globe with larger than life characters.
Avengers : End Game: With the expectations sky high, the Russo brothers delivered a fitting finale to this franchise.
What worked:
1. The emotions were very well connected with the audience.
2. Jaw dropping CGI and VFX.
3. The last battle.What could have been better:
1. Screenplay a bit slow.
2. The war sequence could have been a bit lengthier.Overall, this experience is for a life time and hence everyone should enjoy this wonder movie in IMAX",positive
"I will not tell you anything about the plot, simply because almost everything in it can be considered as a spoiler, but I can convey my attitude. It was neither good nor bad.The plot is linear, simple and predictable. Classic Marvel.There was a lot of humor in the movie. Too much, especially considering the atmosphere of loss and hopelessness, which was at the end of the ""Infinity War"" and which one is trying to get to believe here.And I liked the final action scene.So in fact, I have nothing more to say about this movie. An entire era has passed. This is just the end.This is endgame.",positive
Captain America switched with lokki at some point in past and captain never returned. This was more like a soap than action movie.,negative
This movie is absolutely amazing. I enjoyed almost every part of the amazing journey. Much better then infinity war and it truest lives up to the incredible hype it created over time. 10/10 would recommend.,positive
"Seemed like there were many way Thanos could've been defeated at the end. Even more, what about a future where Nebula doesn't go on the mission where other Nebula can read her thoughts? Then there's no Thanos busting into the future and Iron Man doesn't have to die.
A huge disappointment, like a bad dream.",positive
"He deserves an OSCAR.
What he did for marvel and the fans was great.
I'm great full to TONY STARK.
LOVE YOU 3000.💔",positive
"This movie was awesome. I liked it a lot. Of course the actors were awesome as well. The story was great. 3 hours sitting straight... well it wasn't seem that much for me. The Russo brothers did this very good. Respect for them. This whole cinematic universe is incredibly good. At some points you will get emotional :)
And this movie is just a perfect ending.
That's it.",positive
"This movie was both beautiful and sad. I loved all the characters and it was a(n) (almost) perfect way to finish off phase 3 of the MCU. Tony was perfect in this movie and cried so hard when he reunited with Peter and during his funeral. I was so happy to see Peggy and Steve together and it was so nice to see Falcon take up the role of Captain America.
Thanos was more enjoyable this time round and I did enjoy seeing Ebony Maw again. Nebula had one of the best stories ever in the movie and I was rooting for her. She and Tony were the emotional centers of this film. Prof. Hulk was also genius and I loved Clint. Nat was cool too.I do have some problems with film though. First off, why hype up Captain Marvel when she was barely in the movie and what was going on with her hair? Plus all the fat jokes they used with Thor. I was not a fan of it. Thor can be fat if he want to but not just for comic relief.",positive
"In the last film, the main villain thanos won and fulfilled his main goal of wiping out half of all life in the universe through six infinity stones which resulted in also half of all heroes turning to dust but ironically sparing the original six avengers. He then retires to a far-off planet and gets rid of the stones only to be ambushed and killed by the surviving avengers. And 5 years later, when all hope seemed lost, a surviving hero thought to be among the vanished, plots a new plan and they embark on a mission to undo the villain's work.Directed once again by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, Avengers endgame is the ultimate conclusion of the original team from the first avengers movie. It brings all heroes together from previous films into an ultimate epic battle against the main villain and his army. In Infinity war, the stakes were getting higher and higher as thanos began to gradually get all the six stones, whereas in endgame, there isn't much for the heroes to lose until thanos from 2014 suddenly arrives just as they finished undoing the snap and ultimately have to battle him again.Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson as the original six avengers are all phenomenal in this film. They have excellent chemistry and are willing to put aside their old feuds to undo a tragic event that affected the whole universe. Robert and Scarlett particularly as Tony & Nat respectively are so good in portraying their characters that the emotional weight is felt when they sacrifice themselves for the greater good of the universe(Nat sacrificing herself so clint can get the soul stones & Tony using the six stones to erase Thanos & his army). Endgame provides a satisfying conclusion to the characters that helped start the MCU.Josh Brolin is once again phenomenal as Thanos. In this film, Thanos is different. In infinity war, Thanos is more humanised and doesn't kill unless he has too. He was also merciful and while he makes sure the snap is at random, he does make a few exceptions(Notably Tony and Thor). However in endgame, his personality is similar to that of his comic book counterpart. When he learns about what the heroes are trying to do, he plots a new plan to come into their timeline, destroy them all & then use the stones to destroy the universe and make a new grateful one. Thanos in endgame is far more ruthless and doesn't hold back as he is now willing to eliminate any opposition that stands his way unlike infinity war where he just throws them out of his way.The visual effects are also stunning in this film and it surely did deserve any Oscar nomination for it though it should have gotten a few more nominations. The action sequences such as the battle of earth are among the greatest battles in cinematic history while quotes such as I am iron man, I am Inevitable and Avengers assemble are some of the greatest quotes in a superhero film.Now for the main issues, I think Endgame saturation was quite bad. For example, Nebula doesn't have that much screen time, Natasha doesn't get any memorial for her sacrifice & war machine doesn't do that much except for helping the surviving team hunt thanos down, getting the power stone from Morag as well as contributing in the final battle. Even the film doesn't really explain how captain America returned the stones in their physical form.Overall while endgame was predictable unlike infinity war, it's still one of the greatest superhero films in cinema and satisfying conclusion to the original team that started the MCU.",positive
"The conclusion of phase 1 is a good movie, yet, lacks what Infinity War presented. The first flaw in the movie was the strange effort to make Thor a comedic relief. Thor has been able to persevere through the deaths of all of his family and best friend in prior movies, yet, now, he hits bottom because Thanos won and he now has a chance to defeat him and undo what Thanos accomplished, yet, he remains a fat depresso? A better play would have been for Thor to return to full strength and join the battle a ripped warrior, not a fat Lebowski. The second mistake in Endgame was not making the angry Hulk come out in the end of the movie to battle with the original Avengers against Thanos. The third mistake was why did the film focus so much on the lamest Avenger, Legolas? No one cares about the arrow shooter, come on man. The fourth mistake was making Thanos too weak without the stones. Thanos was an ultimate conqueror in Infinity War, why was he battling alone so much against the Avengers without a more intelligent battle scheme with his Order. Lastly, unless Downey Jr and Evans wanted to retire from their roles, why kill them off??? Downey Jr is the focal point of the MCU, why not keep him around for minor future roles? Plus, why not give the shield to Bucky, like the comics. Seems a little strange to deviate from the comics like that. Fifth, how Stark obtained the Guantlet was hard to see and understand, sloppy writing. Finally, why not have an end credit scene? We need a lead to phase 2? The good points are that the end battle was overall good, Stark saving the day and dying was shocking, and the scenes of going back in time, a la Back to the Future 2, was fun. Overall, the movie was a 7 out of 10, not as good as Infinity War, definitely not deserving of ranking higher than the best superhero movie of all time, the Dark Knight. Notably, I'm a huge Marvel fan.",positive
If I hadn't seen the IW this would be the best movie ever but my overall feeling is not the same as it was with IW. Some weird highlights : Tony hasn't got a badass Mk armor especially for Thanos. Fat Thor? Why drag it so far and made him look stupid and powerless?. Nerd Hulk had no altercation with Thanos. Captain Marvel great and powerful but just 2-3 scenes. A great and epic 11 years conclusion but something was missing. Can't really put my finger on it.,positive
"Endgame's here! We waited for it and it came fast as well. Just a year. Enough to generate the kind of buzz, MARVEL wanted. Because in front of Infinity War, This stands nowhere. It's my personal opinion so just relax. At the run time of more than 3+ hr, we waited for 2 hour just to realize it's all actually happened which was already there in the fan theories. Yet a fan has a patience to grant his left patience towards a climax which should have been better or more powerful than Infinity War. Honestly I felt more bad seeing those superheroes turning to dust in Infinity War rather than seeing the main Avengers dying in Endgame. And the time travel. So easy for them to make it happen right. An easy plan which was well executed by our Avengers. And they did get the stones back, all of them. Without any complications! Well this didn't worked for me. We have seen Avengers thriving to fight Thanos in Infinity War. But here, well I would just say poor Thanos! At our climax, everybody's a superhero. Literally everybody. Like they were just waiting to show up in the end somewhere behind the Avengers office. Emotionally, that's good but cinematically that's weak! No fear we had like the 'what if' moment in Infinity War. And honestly Infinity War stays over the top than Endgame in terms of action, plot lines, music, vfx. So here's my rating. 6. And by the way it's a one time watch, to fulfill the curiosity of the hype!",positive
"I was really really looking forward to this film, all the Marvel films have been brilliant and this was set to be the icing on the cake. We'll I think someone got the salt and sugar mixed up! I don't want to spoil it but the last film was truly brave in what happened and this just undid all of that suspense like a plot from a daytime soap opera. Obviously diehard fans will disagree and that is why we all have our own opinions but as just someone who enjoys all films this was over hyped and under delivered. You need to watch it to wrap up the previous films but if you don't just imagine the ending you would like. Shame on you Marvel!",negative
"So, it all came to this, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the most financially and commercially successful superhero franchise for the last 12 years, and this was the conclusion to the Avengers storyline, the most anticipated, and highest-grossing movie of 2019 (it made $2 billion in 11 days, faster than Avatar, and surpassed the record of Titanic), it's the highest-grossing superhero movie of all time, directed by the Russo brothers (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier & Civil War). Basically half of all life on Earth was disintegrated by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and the Infinity Gauntlet. Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) rescues Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), who were stranded in space following their defeat by Thanos on Titan. They reunite with the remaining Avengers: Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle). They plan to retake the Infinity Stones and reverse the disintegrations, they locate and confront Thanos, but find that he has destroyed the Stones, in anger Thor kills Thanos. Five years later, Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is returned (by chance) from the quantum realm to find the world devastated and half of the population disappeared in a snap. Scott finds Hope van Dyne aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and her father Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) have vanished but finds his daughter Cassie (Emma Fuhrmann) is now a teenager. Meanwhile, Rogers is attending grief counselling sessions for survivors still struggling following the wipe out, while Romanoff is at the Avengers' compound tirelessly keeping watch over both Earth and the rest of the universe with the help of Rhodes, Danvers, Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rocket, and Nebula. Lang returns to the compound; he explains that five years had only five hours for him in the quantum realm and theorises that it may be possible to build a time machine to reverse the annihilation. Stark refuses to help out of fear that he will lose his daughter Morgan (Lexi Rabe), who was born after the disintegration, but he talks with his wife Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and does his own experiments. Banner has embraced the Hulk part of him, and melded himself and Hulk together as one, he agrees that it is possible to go back in time and steal the Infinity Stones before Thanos is able to collect them. Banner and Rocket travel to the small town of New Asgard, where Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and the last survivors of Asgard have settled, they are shocked to Thor overwhelmed by guilt, with overgrown hair and overweight, eating junk, drinking, and playing video games with his friends Korg (Taika Waititi) and Miek, but they eventually convince him to return. Romanoff recruits Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), now a ruthless vigilante after his family was disintegrated. Initial experiments with the time machine with Lang go awry, but Stark arrives to shows them his findings to perfect it, and testing it with Barton, it is confirmed that it works. The Avengers plan which places in time to travel to where the five Infinity Stones are located. Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark travel to the battle of New York City in 2012 (Avengers Assemble) to retrieve the Time, Mind, and Space Stones. Banner visits the Sanctum Sanctorum and convinces the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) to give him the Time Stone. Rogers successfully retrieves the Mind Stone, after battling with himself. Stark and Lang's interference inadvertently allows Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to escape with the Space Stone. But Stark remembers the Space Stone being in S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters in 1970, he and Rogers travel back to retrieve it, Rogers sights Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), and Stark has a meaningful conversation with his father Howard (John Slattery). Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013 (Thor: The Dark World) to extract the Reality Stone from Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), while there Thor has a conversation with his mother Frigga (Rene Russo), as it is the day she will be killed, which he cannot reverse, and he retrieves his hammer Mjolnir. Nebula and Rhodes travel to Morag in 2014 (Guardians of the Galaxy) and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) can. Rhodes returns to the present with the Power Stone, but Nebula is unable to return, her cybernetic interface has connected with that of her past self. Through this connection, the past version of Thanos learns of his future success and the plan of the Avengers to undo it. Thanos captures Nebula and sends past Nebula to the present day disguised as her future self. Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir in the same year and learn that the Soul Stone requires the death of a loved one, they argue which of them should sacrifice themselves, but ultimately Romanoff falls to her death, allowing Barton to obtain the Soul Stone. Reuniting in the present, the Avengers fit the five Stones into a Stark-created gauntlet. Banner volunteers himself to wield the gauntlet, reasoning that he can withstand the radiation poisoning and the immense pain brought on by using the Stones. The snap of Banner's fingers is successful, all those disintegrated are resurrected, and one of the two of the group reunite with loved ones. However, past Nebula uses the time machine to transport past Thanos and his warship to the present, he attacks the Avengers compound. Nebula convinces past Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to turn against Thanos, and kills her past self, while Stark, Rogers and Thor battle Thanos. Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) arrives with other sorcerers, the Avengers: T'Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie), the Guardians of the Galaxy: Drax (Dave Bautista) and Groot (Vin Diesel), and the armies of Wakanda, Asgard, and the Ravagers. The fight between good and evil begins, Danvers arrives and destroys Thanos' warship, and Thanos seizes the gauntlet, but Stark maneuvers the Infinity Stones from his hand to his own, clicks his fingers, turning Thanos and his entire army into dust. Parker and Potts console Stark as he dies from radioactive overexposure to the Stones. A funeral is held for Stark, with all the Avengers, including leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Wakandans, Asgardians, and all other associated characters, attending. Barton and Wanda take solace in the fact that Romanoff and Vision did not return in the snap. Thor makes Valkyrie the Queen of Asgard, he joins the Guardians of the Galaxy to find his true purpose, free of the burden of royalty and leadership. Barton returns home to his family and Parker returns to school, where he is reunited with his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon). Meanwhile, Rogers is tasked to go into the past to return the Infinity Stones and Thor's hammer to their original time lines, but after doing so, he chose to remain in the past to live a full life. Rogers appears before Wilson and his friend Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) as an old man, he passes his shield and the mantle of Captain America on to Wilson, and a flashback reveals that he finally found happiness with Peggy Carter. By the way, there is no post-credits sequence, only some sound effects. Also starring Benedict Wong as Wong, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Letitia Wright as Shuri, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, Angela Bassett as Ramonda, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, William Hurt as Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Winston Duke as M'Baku, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hernández as Agent Sitwell, Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow, Ring's Hiroyuki Sanada as Akihiko, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw, James D'Arcy as Jarvis, Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Ross Marquand as Red Skull (Stonekeeper) and a posthumous cameo by Stan Lee as a 1970s Driver. You will almost not notice or care about the three hour running time, it is a story in three acts: the devastation of the world, time travelling to reverse it all, and the battle to save the world, the cast playing the superheroes and the villains are all great, it is the characters that really add to it all, it has good humour, it has amazing special effects, fight sequences and spectacle, and it gets you emotionally as well, a fantastic and fitting conclusion to the saga, a brilliant fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!",positive
"Avengers endgame is an amazing movie, a perfect payoff of all previous films. The fight scenes are some of the greatest scenes ever. Gotta thank Marvel studios for this film.",positive
They landed the plane. You cannot do a better job of ending a gigantic story. Kudos to the Russo brothers and the entire cast.,positive

"First I wanna say that i'm not the biggest marvel fan! I like the movies, But they're not the best movies in the world! I think the hype around it is way too much!
Anyway, after saying that, it was definitly the best marvel movie till now!
I got goosebumps, I almost cried sometimes, I laughed, I screamed. Eventhough i'm not the biggest fan, I still loved it, and Everyone have to see this movie",positive
"I was born in the 1990s, and I used to envy the ""previous generation "": audiences 40 years ago, whose theaters had the closing scenes of the original Star Wars trilogy; Audiences 20 years ago could see the final chapter of the Lord of the rings in the cinema. Fans have had their ups and downs, but now we have a common memory: the marvel cinematic universe. Thank you, the avengers.",positive
"Whyy??? they brought back same fabula.
A triumph of sorts. Not of acting: with some notable exceptions - a beer-bellied, tragicomic Chris Hemsworth as Thor among them - a feeling of exhaustion has crept in with a number of the principals over the 10 or so years since Iron Man set this gargantuan, quippy super-opera in motion. Nor of dialogue: not even Don Cheadle can deliver a line like ""We are all about that superhero life,"" and the little speeches tend to fall flat, to the point where the film gets self-conscious about them. Nor of direction: for the first hour or so, the Russo brothers rely heavily on your good will toward the superfolk who remain in the wake of ""blue meanie"" Thanos' halving of the universe's population, and the relentless stream of fan service in the two hours that follow may leave even the truest believer feeling milked. But a triumph of feeling: of itches scratched, of sorrows and angers eased, even of longings fulfilled. A triumph of theme: the team's time-travel gambit hammers home the Why We Fight virtues of home and hearth, of Mom and Dad and the kids. And above all, a triumph of plotting: thread after narrative thread tied off in neat and sometimes unexpected (and unexpectedly satisfying) fashion. The MCU will go on and on, but this chapter - and the American pragmatism vs. American ideals bromance that drove it - have well and truly come to their ""Excelsior! Nuff said!"" moment.",positive
"Just a superb example of beautiful story telling!3 hrs passes in the blink of an eye, although you come out feeling like you have been put through an emotion wringer. Incredibly well done, even down to the appropriate, satisfying but not ""happy"" ending...Just see it - no - just see ALL of the MCU movies :-)",positive
"It was not the best but it was like ok
the first half kind of got boring
then after the interval it gets more interesting and epic",positive
"Hope 'endgame' means no more sequels. Story is so thin, the dialogues so silly and the melodrama painful that even the fine actors are not given a chance to show their abilities. What a marvellous waste ot time.",negative
"It takes about 1 hour before the movie starts for real because the beginning was very slow and only a buildup to the time travel and the main plot. Just drama and many funny moments but no action.Then it becomes much better with both tragedy, comedy and just pure gold. The flashbacks to older Marvel movies were really well done and makes sense. The final battle was one of the best battles i have ever seen and it didn't feel too long but not too short either. Iron Man's and Black Widow's deaths were both heartwarming and sad.Overall Infinity War is better because it is more eventful with more action and none tough parts but this is still a very good movie.",positive
"When I walked into the theater for my first viewing of Endgame, I was prepared to see a great superhero movie. I expected some massive fight scenes, a few emotional gut punches, and to walk away with a generic positive message about overcoming obstacles. But I could have never guessed that night that I would cry like a baby, go completely numb from pure awe, and leave the theater with a fresh take on what it really means to be human. It was a night I'll likely remember for the rest of my life.It all started back in 2008 with the first Iron Man, which was soon followed by several other movies based on popular superheroes from Marvel comics. These superheroes became known as Avengers, appearing together in several blockbuster hits to fight world-threatening enemies. Endgame is the culmination of 22 movies across 11 years, and the anticipation and pressure from the fans were higher than ever before. But somehow, Marvel managed to produce an overwhelmingly satisfying conclusion that met or exceeded all expectations.The premise of Endgame's storyline is fairly simple: defeat the mad titan Thanos after he wiped out half the universe's population and bring back everyone he killed. However, it ends up quite complex, dealing with quantum physics and time travel. The directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, do an admirable job of making the storyline easy to follow, bouncing between dozens of different settings and timelines without feeling too cluttered. There are also a surprisingly low number of plot holes considering that the movie deals with time travel.When it comes to pacing, the film has some minor issues. It sometimes feels unnecessarily drawn out during some of the middle sections, where the movie takes a less serious tone and the stakes don't feel quite as high. But it more than makes up for it with an action packed beginning and ending filled with shocking surprises and adrenaline rushes to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.One of the movie's most impressive feats is how it is able to include so many characters without making a single one feel left out. The main characters of this movie are the original six Avengers, which include Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. Apart from the Hulk, who unfortunately does not get much of a spotlight, all of their characters develop beautifully throughout the movie and have several major moments to shine. Iron Man in particular ends up almost the complete opposite of his selfish, egotistical, and ignorant past self. Even Thanos, despite being the main antagonist, has a very interesting arc that affects his grand motives as he learns more about humanity's flaws.As we have come to expect from marvel, the production quality is as good as it gets. The acting performances from all the cast members are easily some of the best they have ever done. Whether through dialogue or simply just facial expressions, the actors and actresses do an amazing job conveying their characters' emotions. The visuals are stunning, with a vibrant color palate and awe inspiring cinematography. The movie relies heavily on cgi, but it is done so well that everything looked completely photorealistic. Accompanying that was a stellar soundtrack by Alan Silvestri that masterfully matches the tone of each scene, elevating them to new heights. ""Portals"" in particular is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, and it still gives me major chills every time I listen to it.The movie particularly excels at creating a very atmospheric feel to many of its scenes, using it's soundtrack and visuals to immerse the viewer into its vast world. Some of the best examples of this are in an early scene with Iron Man in a spaceship, which wonderfully captures the melancholic but peaceful tone of the scene. And perhaps the most prominent example is in the iconic ""Portals"" scene, which emanates sheer awe with its beauty and scope, starting slowly and naturally building up to an earth-shattering climax.A common criticism with superhero movies in general is that they are mindless ""popcorn entertainment"" only good for action and surprises. However, with Endgame, this could not be further from the truth. Through the Avengers' personal struggles and Thanos's quest to make a perfect universe, the film goes the extra mile in showing how the world and its people are far from perfect, but our lives can still be beautiful. This idea is especially shown within the deeply moving final few scenes.Avengers: Endgame is a wonderfully thrilling experience for its audience. But it goes a step further and shows us why cinema and storytelling are so important. As Endgame illustrates, emotions are defining characteristics of humanity, and whether good or bad, they shape our lives and allow us to grow. What better way to experience these emotions than through some amazing stories?",positive
"This movie is all That I wanted from a movie for a long time im still on the hypetrain eventhough I am a couple of tv show episodes behind but I try to clear everything up, cant wait until future project.",positive
This should be higher up the top 250! It was such a great surprise! I've never see anything like it! It was such an epic superhero movie and I loved every minute of it! It has to be one of my all time favourite superhero movie and absolutely favourite movie ever! I can't believe the outcome though! There won't be anymore avengers movies after this!,positive
"Maybe not the best mcu movie, but the one I find the most satisfying. Watching this in theaters for the first time was truly an experience. This is essentially 3 separate movies- a post apocalyptic drama (act 1), a time heist (act 2), and an epic (act 3). It may not hold up as well on rewatch, but there is nothing like watching this movie for the first time.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame. Wow, feels like just yesterday I was six years old, sitting in a movie theater with my parents and watching the first Ironman movie. Man what a ride it has been. This movie may not be as exciting and action packed as Avengers: Infinity War was, but it had a tremendous story to it. Despite it being confusing, once you figure it out it was one hell of a story that will keep anyone engaged and make them want our hero's to win. Using time travel as a plot device can be risky, but Marvel has pulled it off, just like many other things we didn't think they could pull off.
Pros-
EmotionalFinal act was AMAZINGCharacter arcs were satisfyingone of the best stories in the MCUthe acting was phenomenalthe visuals were beyond amazingthe writing was amazing as wellHUGE PAYOFF OF TEN YEARS OF STORYTELLINGCons-
-Needed more action
some of the time travel plot is confusingCaps ending kind of breaks his character arc and is confusingThanos didn't have as much of a character arc but that's understandable seeing as though Marvel wanted the hero's to have more screen time-some scenes were dragged out
Overall: 9.5/10 MUST WATCH MOVIE!!!!!!!",positive
"It was my least favorite Avenger movie. I've been a huge MCU fan from the beginning and it feels like this movie strayed from the core elements of previous ones. It thought they dumbed it down a bit. They were almost trying to be too funny (especially with the Thor & Hulk stories) that you lost a bit of the depth. Ultimately dissapointed compared to how hyped I was going into it. Also, they didn't need to kill that many people or finish them out so 'neatly.' Huge Captain fan, and I thought his ending didn't really fit what his character would actually choose to do. It was kind of a let down.",positive
"The Russos couldn't have subverted our expectations in a better way. Simply, because they didn't give a hoot about our expectations. Instead, they gave us a a continuation of Infinity War with a most unexpected conflict. In other words, they went for the head; all we cared about are the stones.They also proved that they understand every character in this universe better than anyone. They delved into their minds and hearts in a way fans ever hoped and fancied. They truly fleshed out our beloved avengers by showing them as more humans exactly as we felt about them at every important moment in every movie in the MCU. They convinced us that these characters really experienced these moments, and thus cared about them as much as we do. The incredible cast, who are at the top of their game, couldn't have complemented what the Russos did for their characters more perfectly.Whilst the unique storytelling of Infinity War never feels ""cinematic"", I absolutely loved it with its epic quality and how I felt that I was flipping pages of a graphic novel instead of watching a movie. The Russos used once again the same exceptional style of narration here, except that, to my surprise, it feels as ""cinematic"" as it gets! I have absolutely no clue how they have managed to do such a thing, but what I know is that this made me realize that Infinity War is flawed, especially in this aspect, way more than I thought. Everything here works twice as good as it did in Infinity War: comedy and drama. Also, this made the fast pacing don't come at the expense of the cohesiveness of the story.The movie did make it a bit easy for itself sometimes (and we can see that in certain decisions that some character took, and a couple of things that are quite perfunctory that they could have gone deeper with), but the movie also took three thousand risks that entangled itself in what could have an endless loop of nonsensical chaos only to serve the franchise's fans, and it did as good as it gets.(9/10)",positive
"I think my problem with this movie is there was SO MUCH STORY to cover that much of the screen time is devoted to exposition and tying up loose ends- too much of the movie feels more like an obligation than an adventure.My other complaint is that there were some fantastic ideas presented in the film that don't quite play out to their potential. It still get points for introducing the ideas at all, but ultimately they left me a touch disappointed.But honestly, I can't imagine how they could've done things any differently (just like Dr. Strange said! There was only one way for this to end!).I won't ruin the ending, but I'll just say it's clear that ACT 3 is where the filmmakers put all of their attention, and it pays off VERY well.I think Infinity War is a far superior movie in terms of writing, editing, and overall fun, but this movie will still satisfy fans.Bitter sweet see the end of a 10 year era of movie-making, but it was great to be along for the ride.",positive
"Warning spoilers a plenty.I thought it was utter rubbish, complete drivel. Nearly everything was off and wrong about this bore-fest.Almost nothing happened. It was so boring. Virtually the entire first 90 minutes could have been trimmed to about 15 mins.Pacing was terrible, it lost all momentum at times and was tedious.
The feel of the film, was all over the place, jumping from very dumb childish comedy to attempted serious drama and then to social commentary. It didn't natural have a core or flow to the film.So many stupid, misplaced scenes, such as the ""girl power"" nonsense, so contrived.Massive plot holes. I know Time Travel is a very difficult subject to tackle, but this made little sense. Either you cannot change the past or you can? This sometimes does and other times doesn't. If you steal the Stones then try to put them back. In theory they haven't been stolen, as you can't change the past, therefore, how can you put them back? How on earth did Captain America manage to put the Stones back and Thor's hammer and presumably the Green girl? They erased Thanos and the Robot girl in same timeline as well and that didn't effect anything?Apparently you can't kill a baby Thanos, but you can kill a slightly younger adult version of Thanos when he comes to the future that is okay.How did Capt A, put the Stones back at the exact time they left, without interfering with the original operation to retrieve them or changing the past anyway.The cringe worthy comedy was awful. There was a serious tone to Avengers, but this just turned into a cheap gag reel. Thors (a god) getting fat. Hulk getting fans.Corny cheap false scenes with Tony and his daughter, with the terrible music playing at the same time, like some cheap matinee from the 50's.Overall there was no feeling or emotion, the funeral scene was false and contrived.Pepper Potts is now Iron Woman?Spider-man goes back to school, after 5 years away? Really?I saw it with my teenage Daughter, she thought it was crap and we heard most people around us saying the same thing.A real stinker this one. 0/10.",negative
"When I saw Infinity wars I knew the next movie will deal with unsnaping and the defeat of Thanos. After a year of waiting I saw the movie like everybody else.
The sense of loss and of losing someone is tremendous both aspects are very different from comic books storylines, but for a movie it is important. In this movie the action, pace, and exuberance of supers is very less and slow. The concentration was given to human emotions, hopelessness and consequent coping to hard reality. However, few things I would avoided in scripting would the way in which they solved the problem and the credibility of the description of such powerful stones. Mysterious soul stone, its layer, reason for sacrifice all has meaning except for the convenience of the plot. Time stone description in Dr.Strange has no role either. This entire movie fooled everyone by think stones have tremendous possibilities but it was just meant for the plot. That was disappointing.
However it is master piece considering the way in which it was made. If I had to analyze and nitpick all the plot holes it would be full of spoilers.
So I would say watch the movie and enjoy the epic conclusions.",positive
A Masterpiece That Will Never Happen Again..So Much Surprises And Fun And it is Really Emotional .. Omg Omg I really cant believe that they made it Awesome And Fantastic like that❤,positive
I think no more such movies.Tony' s death and Natasha's sacrifice very sad.it was obvious that the captain was worthy.Fat Thor is idiot because blames itself.,positive
"First off, I'll just say that you should put aside any fears that its three-hour run-time might be down to a lack of pace, for 'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' moves exactly as it needs to and it really does fly by. It's not too fast-paced, though, as it takes the time to make sure its events have an impact, which is greatly appreciated. The story, which is shrouded in secrecy and - on my part - shall remain so, is actually quite bold. It never feels like it's under any pressure to move in a specific direction, constantly evolving in natural and, even, somewhat surprising ways. It may take a few small leaps in logic, and generally require a bit more suspension of disbelief than is usual with this sort of stuff, but it never breaks its own rules. Every decision the filmmakers make is for the benefit of the narrative, even those which gloss over - and, thus, retrospectively highlight - some of its (admittedly fastidious) unanswered questions. None of these possible, and only very slight, 'plot holes' even matter, though, primarily because the affair is so much fun. It also takes a lot of risks, being as far away from 'cookie-cutter' as it can. While it may lean towards some elements that long-time fans of the overall franchise might have seen coming, it always presents things in fairly unique, unexpected ways and consistently puts importance on character above all else. This is, as usual, what really makes the feature work. Even when things are at their biggest (and, trust me, they get big), you're never far from a smaller, often more satisfying character-revealing moment. The major characters here are more well-rounded than in 'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)', despite the fact that there's almost as many. This includes, thankfully, Captain America himself, who was somewhat sidelined last time; in fact, he's perhaps the main player this time, alongside Iron Man. Some characterisations are also unanticipated and will almost certainly be polarising, but they're certainly appreciated - even if only for the risk. The antagonist is a little weaker this time as he's a bit more traditionally 'bad guy', but he's built on a more-than-solid foundation and is as imposing as ever. Marvel have made no qualms in calling this the end of an era - the so-called 'infinity saga', to be more specific - and it really does feel like a culmination of this (over) ten-year journey, especially in terms of the 'main' Avengers. It's certainly a film for the fans and it isn't squeamish about it. It's incredibly satisfying, to say the least. It's also incredibly moving in a number of key scenes. You'll experience pretty much every emotion a movie can give you. The whole thing is slightly strange, helped immensely by knowing very little before going in. It's almost difficult to describe, in a way, but its effect is actually quite profound. I suppose it takes a while to 'come to terms' with. I don't think I've fully formed my opinion on it just yet. Don't get me wrong, though. It's great. It's more than great. It's a new kind of cinematic event, the kind of story only possible with a twenty-one movie backlog of character histories and audience investment. The more I think about it, the more I like it. The visuals are stunning, the CG is seamless, the action is spectacular, the characters are superb, the scale is staggering, the scope is substantial, the stakes are serious and the story is simply splendid. It really is something. 9/10",positive
"We have had a ten-year relationship with the MCU. It started with IRON MAN, moved on to Captain America, inserted young Spider-Man and even gave us royalty in Black Panther. So here we are ten years later ready to sit another three hours with our favorite superheroes. After speculating and scouring the internet for the clues the day has finally come. Avengers Endgame is here.The question is, was it worth it? A resounding yes. This movie was thoughtful, and action-packed at the same time.It opens with our remaining Avengers trying to resolute what just happened. One would think that the Russo Brothers would give us a movie filled with Sadness and Revenge, but that's not the case here. Thor still gives us strength and humor. Cap gives us optimism and Tony aka Iron Man finally figures out what's important to him. Dr. Banner/Hulk is still a mystery however Black Widow gives us a little vulnerability.Where does Captain Marvel fit, and will they ever find the other Avengers all those questions get answered?Some things to be aware of, the first half of the movie takes a slower pace. It allows the surviving Avengers to grieve. Also, the reintroduction of Ant-Man and Arrow are handled smoothly.This movie is an emotional rollercoaster at times. This movie is for us die-hard Marvel fans. The ones that grew up reading the comic books and binged watched all the other films in the MCU getting ready for this,We're going to say goodbye to some favorites but not before we are treated to epic battles and friendships are mended.Avengers, Endgame is everything we want from Marvel and more. One last Cameo from Stan Lee and one last time our Avengers face down evil. The three hours are going to fly by and leave us a little sad, but Endgame gives us a fitting ending.Scale: I give this movie a nine. Good things do come to those that wait.Diversity: It gets 8.5 superheroes do all come in different shapes and color.",positive
"Reading through some of the low mark reviews from what one can only presume are DC fans I can assure the hand full of people whom are yet to see this movie that this is without any doubt a masterpiece in modern movie making. I've read comments on how the first third of the film is 'too slow' but this is totally necessary due the need to portray the weight of devastation caused by the snap from the end of the Infinity War instalment, as a stand alone movie it's quite the spectacle however to truly appreciate it I would recommend seeing all the previous MCU movies from the past 10 years chronological to truly benefit from all the call backs. Go see it, buy it, marvel at it and maybe DC can learn a thing or two from it.",positive
"Hurts to be a fan and say something like this. Avengers: Endgame is a movie that takes too long to mesh, forcing a situation of drama that does not convince in many parts. Practically 2/3 hours of film with many unnecessary dialogues and misdirected performances. The plot holes and bad decisions of the writers is quite evident, except for those who do not expect much from a movie that should end a fantastic universe era built over eleven years. Even so, it has it's high points in 1/3 - great moments, solid acting, and so much fan service. It's a pity that's not in the same level of Avengers: Infinity War at all, but is an 'Ok movie' and don't deserves 10/10 and 1/1 rates.",positive
"Before reading this, I just request you to take two minutes and think of best possible conclusion to this 22 movies saga. Thought of one? Now multiply the awesomeness of your ending by a 100 times and still this movie will surprise your assumptions! If a critic like me who just can't stop finding errors in a movie failed in finding big mistakes in this movie, I think you should believe this one is just perfect! Sure there were a few tweaks, but I am ready to ignore them seeing how smoothly the whole 3 hours of the runtime just passed by. I was literally sticked to my seat for 3 hours, even during the interval, I was like I want to see the whole movie in one length. Tell you the truth, I was not much impressed with Infinity wars or Ragnarok (not even mentioning captain marvel here xD), but Russo brothers just nailed this one. After waiting for 21 movies, we deserved a perfect end, and we got one. 10/10 from my side. If 21 movies lead to this, I am ready to watch another set of 21 for such a perfection!",positive
"Endgame consistently felt off from the start to the end. The tone is just strange, the pacing is messy and the plotholes are ridiculous and badly effect the enjoyment of the film. That said there are some fun scenes.This felt more like a tying up of loose ends rather than a real self-contained film. While I liked Infinity War they really backed themselves into a corner when they got time travel involved. So many plot holes and convoluted plot lines concerning time travel.... How is Captain America able to come back at the end if he has gone to a different time line? This is a direct contradiction of something they said previously in the film - that going back into time does not change the future. But, lo and behold, Captain America is suddenly in this very timeline, but somehow without affecting it? This makes no sense.How does Captain Marvel know where Tony Stark is??! In the vast endless expanse of space she somehow randomly comes across him!!? This is never explained.Stark figuring out time travel in about 2 minutes is just laughable.How can Thanos be so powerful without the infinity gauntlet so that he can easily defeat Thor, Iron man and Captain America all at once?!? This was the most fun fight scene by far but it is partly ruined by its illogical premises. Reminds me of Star Trek Discovery where we are supposed to be dazzled by the spectacle and not take plot continuity seriously anymore.As other people have pointed out they ruined the character development they had set up with Thanos' character. This wonderfully rich character is killed in the first 5 mins of the film. Only to be replaced by his more one dimensional past self later. It might as well have been any generic bad guy. There is no satisfying link to the Thanos of the first film.Fat comedy Thor really disrespects his character and just looks and feels so silly. They could have made him depressed and overweight sure, but why make it so pronounced that it becomes hard to take seriously. He has become a (bad) parody of himself. I like the comedy element of these films but please take it back a notch.The interactions between Stark and Rodgers seemed stale and repetitive. It was hard to care anymore. I actually liked the Hulk/Banner hybrid - this was one of the more inventive/original parts of the film. It would have been good to see him actually fight! I liked the interactions between Hawkeye and Black Widow. Their relationship has always been interesting/layered and well acted.The final battle scene felt like a rehash of the one in Wakanda. So, again, hard to get excited about something we have seen before. But of course, it has its fun moments. I loved seeing Scarlet Witch take on Thanos one on one and get the better of him until he calls on the big guns.It seems like the story line of IW bit off more than it could chew. It becomes so overblown and fantastical that it is hard to take seriously anymore. A bit of an anti-climax. But of course its still a must-see because its the culmination of a decade of Marvel films. I still enjoyed this film to an extent, its just a bit disappointing. I could have easily sat through another hour of this if it helped sort out the pacing problems and made more sense of things.",positive
"I can't believe that this was how they decided to bring to a close 11yrs of great stories, and memorable characters, esp after Infinity War left us with such a pit in our stomachs, and anxiety about what would come next for End Game.What we got was completely and utter failure, on biblical proportions, and a storyline that was made for moviegoers who want silly jokes and vivisecting plot holes that make no sense, and go nowhere.With it all tied up in an end battle scene that lasted all of 8 minutes time.I've heard people calling it ""an ode to nostalgia"", and ""a trip down memory lane at its best"".I could not disagree more, and think that the Russo Brothers really dropped the ball, BIG TIME, on a franchise, and group of characters, that have come to define a new generation of movie making, and meant so much to people world wide, over the last decade.For the last 10yrs time, marvel has given me something to be excited about when going to the movies, and something to look forward to every year, with multiple movies released per year, and new faces being added to the line up that projected its credibility & depth to higher & higher levels.21 movies, all come crashing down, in a thunderous, murderous, calamity filled mess of a 3hr movie.To say I am disappointed is an incredible understatement.Bad form, MarvelBad Form, Russo BrothersCompletely Dispicable, Disney.",negative

"Every time I get drawn into a discussion on a comicbook adaptation I will invariably utter the phrase ""Well, in the books...""I'm an old fan of the genre, having read many of the books that are being adapted now as a child. I get very nit-picky when a film strays too far from its source material. The MCU broke me of that. Gradually over the years I accepted new ideas, if introduced in a good way. The details can be mailable, so long as a core theme is adhered to.I walked into Endgame today having no idea what could happen, and no preconceptions about what should happen. The previous 21 (wow) movies all took their source materials in different ways, for better or worse. In the end the source gets a nod, but the characters remain faithful, which was the case here.Nothing of the sequence of events could have been predicted by me, a man whose read the original Infinity Stones series, and that was for the best. If I knew what was going to happen, it wouldn't have made for an enjoyable experience.What I watched was a denouement of an impressive 11 year, 22 film series, the likes of which happening again are extremely remote. I was filled with so much emotion by the end, alternating from cheering to sniffling, I walked out knowing only that I'll be going to see it once more while it is in theater just so I can properly digest what I saw.If you are watching this movie never having seen the previous films (meaning you've been living under a rock for a decade) you won't understand a thing that happens. But as a closing to a series, you could not have expected a better experience.'Nuff said.",positive

"A Malaysian reviewer here. Screening on the 24th April 2019 and All i can say it is a behemoth undertaking compiling 21 or so films, expanding over 11 years of MCU phase 1 and phase 2 universe. How the heck are they going to pull this off? Questions arise and questions being answered with a 3 hour long movie. Its a good solid 3 hour marvel movie.A good slow pace on the first part showing human vulnerability on superheroes. Even superheroes need emotional support from someone. Its is nice to see Hawkeye got some good character scene compared to his last/ previous involvement.Second part comes the built up whereby it is fun to see how they interact with previous marvel films. (note to those don't follow MCU universe) You really need to see few previous marvel films to understand further what i am talking about.The Third act is the final act whereby the brothers did a terrific job giving what fans wanted. An awesome (+/-)45 minutes battle that exceed my expectation. Crazy visual effect/ CGI . Such an eye candy to see on the big screen.All i can say this movie is well worth the 11 years of waiting and the screenwriters and directors did very well in showing off the maturity of marvel MCU films. It is like having all favorite songs and compile it as your greatest hits. This is how endgame felt like to me. It is just so freaking awesoommeeeeeeeeeee",positive
"Seems that they separated every good parts and put them in Infinity Wars and leftovers into this one. Plot is ridiculous, with most of the heroes unused/underused. Are those actors even involved in making of this movie? It is more like clip show episode, made of chaotic parts from previous Avengers, where even CGI quality is different or in the worst case, they combine new things into old scenes, so difference in quality is even more obvious.Time will lower rating of this movie when hype stop. Now, this movie is first one in All time worldwide gross, so it will be more criticized (Avatar can rest now).I watched it in full cinema in first days of screening. We laughed on stupidity of some scenes (every one in theater). At the end, on exit, after 3 hours of painfully boring and bad movie, nobody talked about it...

"The 22nd film in Marvel Cinema Universe has an end of term feel about it. This shows with the lack of post credit scenes.With the population of the universe halved, Thanos has completed his task.The remainder of Earth superheroes try to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet but Thanos destroyed it.It is the appearance of Ant Man who escapes from the Quantum Realm and shows up on Earth after five years that leads to a plan and it involves a Time Heist.What is left of the team go back to different time zones and different parts of the universe to collect the infinity gems. This means re-enacting scenes from previous Marvel films such as Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier. It leads to a moment where Robert Downey Jr, Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth all vie to be in the same shot with a particular superstar actor who supposedly called time on his acting career last year.It is a big spectacle, there is a major battle that comes across as flat when it needed to be better choreographed. There are some emotional scenes with some characters among the fallen.However this is one long movie. It needed to cut at least 45 minutes from its running time. The time travel elements might make sense in comics but not here. At one point, I thought the Russo Brothers were going to outdo Peter Jackson by dragging the film's ending on and on.",positive
I had higher expectation from this movie but it turned out to be superheroes drama/comedy mixed with little action. There was very little action in the movie compare to past Avengers. 3d effects were not up to mark either. I was fairly disappointed by this one.

"I loved this movie. I think its the best movie in Cinematic history. Clearly the best MCU movie.About the movie.
A culmination of 21 movies going back 11 years. Staring pretty much everyone. The best actors of our generation. Thanos the evil Mad-titan obsessed with collecting all Infinity stones: Soul Stone, Power Stone, Time Stone, Space Stone, Reality Stone and Mind Stone. Thanos defeated our heroes, wiped out half of all life in the universe and escaped. This movie is about the result of that defeat and how our heroes will respond.Why the movie is great:
The reason this movie is great is because it's the pinnacle on top of all the other movies in the MCU. It takes clues, places people and stories from all the other movies. You get to see the real human toll on the characters from their defeat. The defeat really wounded them and you get to see that. This makes the film more emotional, real and not disposable. The three act break down like this - First Act - The aftermath of Infinity War, Act 2 - Time Heist, and Act 3. Final Battle. The movie is interesting, mind bending, nostalgic, smart, funny, emotional, entertaining, at times violent, epic and in the end the most satisfy conclusion you could possible get from a movie experience. Watch this movie and you will realized you watched something that will never be replicated again. Maybe not even by the MCU. This not even Movie Magic - it's Movie Sorcery. What Marvel crafted here is nothing short of amazing. It's a movie anyone can enjoy. No matter who you are or where you are. Young, Middle aged, old. Every denomination. If you watch this movie be prepared to cry. Don't bring tissues, bring a towel, a beach towel.",positive

"My Rating : 9/10This is exactly why people go to sit in a dark room with bright lights bouncing back into their retinas for pleasure!Now on to the movie - 'Avengers : Endgame' is a finale of sorts of the Marvel Avengers Franchise which started back in 2008 with Jon Favreau's brilliant 'Iron Man' and we are already 21 movies in after 11 glorious action-packed years!'Avengers : Endgame' is emotional, super funny and lots of little throwbacks to the previous movies for nostalgia value will make this the most talked-about and entertaining movie of the year - There's no place for critics here, it's about the fans' love for the series given justice. If you go looking for plotholes or keep thinking 'well this doesn't make any sense' or 'wow that's dumb' - this isn't for you! All of the MCU movies are romanticist in nature and they are for all ages to enjoy so they can't exactly become too dark or complicated for that matter.Thumbs Up to the Avengers for making it a happy fan experience (and a bit teary-eyed one)!",positive
"I'm not being biased as a hard core Marvel fan this movie concluded my childhood and teenage years and that's it , it's an emotional tear jearker . Don't expect it to be as action packed as Infinity War - for me the best super hero movie ever - and to make such sense as Infinity War",positive
Avengers endgame had very little story progress through the 3 hr run it had and it created so many plot-holes along the way.Time travel is a very tricky story element to implement into your franchise it can make or break the franchise. They even touch base on some of the flaws within the movie yet still happen to create said flaws making the end product into a paradox of itself. I can delve deeper into that but I would risk spoiling the movie.Aside from the paradox they created they didn't utilize Captain Marvel like they should have. In fact she was used more like a one trick pony recreating her final moments in her own movie and recycling it over to the finale of this movie. She was more of a cameo if anything.They had some great moments but those were few and far between. In fact within those 3 hours I can only remember maybe 3 to 4 minutes of quality scenes (not including any trailer footage) which makes these 3 hours drag.So for the final Avengers movie with some of these characters it was a bit disappointing. Definitely not the best marvel superhero movie ever nor an epic conclusion like some claim. Honestly the Captain Marvel movie was more enjoyable and that's not really that great. 6.5/10 for me,positive
"Even if i really loved infinity war and i consider it to be one of best comic book films ever made in scale and heart,but i must say that i loved endgame even more since it doubled all that things and made them even better,and it give us great conclusion to the era of mcu since 2008,endgame had brilliant actors that did a marvelous job and i think that werent any weak link,thanos maybe less focused then in infinity war but still he was able to bring staff that we love about him,this film also has some very sad moments with emotional punch but i think that they did a great job in closing characters arcs and stories,sure there is some staff about time traveling that is messy but in this kind of film i simply dont care",positive
"Pros:
-Minimal Bree Larson
-Cap worthy of the Hammer
-They killed my least favourite avenger *spoiler*(BW)*spoiler*
-Decent battle scene (could've been better)Cons:
-PC one liners (she lacks awe, she's preachy and I skipped her film)
-Phase 4 looks bleak (all orig white male avengers are now black female)
-Too much drama and smug filler (and yet no post credits scene)
-They killed my favourite avenger *spoiler*(Tony Stark)*spoiler*-Overall kinda slow moving and boring, heavy on the preachy and I'm glad Stan Lee didn't live to see it happen.",positive
"Took an age to build up to the final battle where the solution merely involved jumping on Thanos and steeling the stones. You don't need world war 3 first to get to that point.Anyhow, hats off to the filmmakers for making so many people want to watch yet another mediocre story hidden behind shinny cgi.",negative
"Imma be honest: I was afraid this movie would be boring, overly sentimental and poorly written, but luckily IT IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS!! They managed to fill the surprisingly long run-time without boring the audience, and the plot managed to round up the character's stories very well. I was happy when I left the theatre even though the movie obviously had some sad parts. Before seeing it, I was worried I had hyped myself too much and would be disappointed, but instead I am glad that it ended in such a perfect way. Anyone who claims otherwise should be burned alive.",positive
"AVENGERS END GAME .. it's more than overrated.1-As a result I have lost faith in all Rotten tomatoes , metacritic etc . All movie reviews by magazines,newspaper,media...were compromised. All of them were PAID for excellent reviews . Seems majority of the budget was allocated to buy out of world reviews .2-Honestly speaking , 2009 movie Avatar looked more promising for a budget of $250 million while Endgame seems of $100 million.3- Now coming towards the story line .. if summed in one word...The Storyline & screenplay is Average & Some portions of the movie are totally Disgusting .. Pathetic . A comedy show admist grief sticken superheroes with leading Joker Thor. Only Captain America's presence is worthy in the movie .4) Plot Holes like Nebula killed her past self but was still alive .. Captain's shield was destroyed by Thanos but in the last it was being given to falcon to carry on the legacy...
LOL !!Endgame was actually a big hole itself where plot was visible like island . Whole time travel charisma was done deliberately to appeal children.5- Emotions were inserted .. induced . Except for Natasha's sacrifice .. nothing was emotional.6-Whole movie was like moving along a highway with speed breaker every 100 metres. Just the momentum starts to build .. there come brakes .7- Avengers-1 2012 was best superhero action movie but Endgame is CRAP .. three hour headache where many had witnessed people who watches regular Movies are totally been disappointed. A Majority of the crowd felt CHEATED except the today's kids & die hard & stubborn Marvel fans.8 - It could have easily gone past 4 billion dollars if the movie was at par with infinity war coz Endgame was a movie which every cinema lover wanted to be a part of as a Great Saga was coming to an end .9 - Endgame doesn't seems to be the work of Russo brother at all . Just compare with their past movies . It looks more like Frankstein kind of work .",positive
"I was super hyped for Avengers: Endgame after the fantastic Avengers: Infinity War last year. I always wondered ""How were they going to top it?"" so what was the result after sitting in a cinema for almost 3 hours? I came out a little underwhelmed, honestly. I must stress that I don't think Endgame is a bad movie by any means, it's just the bar set by Infinity War was so high for me that all the shortcomings and issues I had with Endgame made me feel like it was the weaker half of the story by quite a significant amount in comparison.One thing I really noticed in Endgame was the pacing and structure of the movie was all over the place. There were weird tangents in the story that didn't really go anywhere and were just used as a quick gag or fan service. Compared to Infinity War where everything flowed so smoothly, it felt to me Endgame's writing was quite sloppy in places. The jokes were not hitting quite as well, and characters were acting differently just for the sake of a contrived moment or joke to occur. Without spoiling anything, Thanos for example seems completely different in Endgame to what he was in Infinity War. There were just so many moments where characters were acting un-natural, that it was distracting.As for the characters and emotional moments, Captain Marvel honestly might as well never have been in this movie. She barely does anything. Iron Man and Captain America get the most screentime for a good reason and have nice conclusions. The Hulk feels toned down here alot and left to the sides. Thor is mostly comic relief here, so if you never found Thor: Ragnarok funny, you might hate him big time here. The others have shared screentime and you do see alot of characters in this movie. It does have a big finale feel to it, and there are many nice references to previous Marvel movies in there too. If you've seen Back to the Future: Part II, that's basically how the Time Travel stuff works. Just try not to think about it too much, otherwise the inconsistencies might annoy you.Overall, I still had a blast with Avengers: Endgame. I was never bored despite the lengthy running time. However, the reason why I felt a little let down, despite still liking it, is that re-watching Infinity War just the night before was close to perfection at telling that side of the story. The sequence of events, the humour, the emotional beats, and the characters all acted at their very best in Infinity War. Endgame to me, felt like a noticeable drop in quality despite the grandness and scale of it acting as a swan song to the MCU Universe. I'm not sure where Marvel can go from here. They've pretty much done the most epic Comic Book Superhero movie storyline they could have ever done, so what's next?7.5/10",positive
"Because the ending was amazing. I'm not lying when i say that there were 3 grown men crying in front of me during the ending, and i heard some sniffing a couple of rows further.It was truly an amazing ending to all of this and they have my respect. They've lost almost of it because of the Captain Marvel fiasco, but they restored it because of this film. Captain Marvel has a cute new haircut which totally fits her personality. I was wondering when she would tell Thanos to get his manager so that Thanos can get fired and everyone's saved. Didn't happen, but i wouldn't be surprised if it did.There is only one man who made and ended this franchise, and i was sincerely happy with his role in all of this. Tony Stark. What an absolute boss.",positive

"I wanted to like this, but it's tough ask when it recycles so much it felt almost parody like. A key character's death is dealt with almost flippantly on two occasions, the main story action is not great and feels re-hashed. It felt like a lukewarm follow up film so in hopes no-one notices it just throws every character at it in the closing section going for epic but it just felt a bloated mess.In the battle for screen time ego it's clear who comes out on top but this isn't an Iron Man film and shouldn't have been. Concentrating on the wrong characters led this down the wrong path. It should have been called Avengers: Inevitable.",positive
"This movie concludes 22 movies over a span of 11 years. This journey has been a emotional roller coaster, starting from Iron Man in 2008. Endgame properly complements its predecessor Infinity War.
This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a finale. After 22 movies that are all feature length.. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth.
In this movie everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. It amazes me how such a large cast was accommodated pretty well in the movie.
If you are a Marvel fan make sure you carry tissues with yourself.
Russo Brothers have done a great job. It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the hero's. The jokes were funny and it really felt like a family. All the visuals looked amazing. From the spaceships to the planets the CGI was flawless. I loved it. It showed that the creators put their heart and soul into making this movie. Avengers Endgame is an absolute treat.
Do watch this movie.",positive
"This film is no Masterpiece. The Russo Brothers phoned in for a relevant follow-up to Infinity War. The first two hours were incredibly dull and boring. This film was filled to the brim with Fan Service and not enough Original Story. The final hour was amazing and worth the price of admission. The movie could've been condensed and it could've gotten to the point sooner. The humor feels forced and lazy. The film was filled with jump cuts and reused camera shots from previous films. The CGI is well done. The acting is poor at points. Overall, this is an average film, with two-thirds of it falling under below average.",positive
"Let's be clear - there was a lot of talking about this film, about how great it will be. Turned out? It was a pretty decent story about time traveling (I honestly like those). I even thought I like it, aside from some little things that don't even worth mentioning. But the ending - oh, let me talk about the ending. It is so horrible that it erased any good impression this movie could've left. I don't have the problem with how it ends, with events presented. I have the problem with how boring, non-aesthetic and amateur it was filmed. I'm furious that funeral scene turned out to be such a cheap vulgarity, such an emptiness that tries to play with viewer's emotions - and, sadly, fails. This is what the character died for? To be honored... With this? Boy, oh boy. I don't know how many people actually like this scene, but I sure do not.
Also - diversity. As a commercial product in the first place, a movie about diverse characters, well, completely non-diversed. Heteronormative, I would say, and in 2019 it is quite anachronistic. Quite obvious, of course, that the company is afraid of possible risks and profit losses - another reason to think about what good such soulless capitalistic approach can give us? From where I stand, nothing good. I don't want to be a consumer, I want to be a viewer that is not treated like a money account. Anyway, I was bitter about it just a little - after all, what can you expect from Marvel and Russos, really? They are not Taika Waititi after all (how honestly great it would be if Taika Waititi filmed all Avengers movies is story for another time), so even queer-coding isn't present. What got me furious is that Russo had the nerves to actually say they included LGBT-representation there. Leaving alone term ""LGBT-representation"" and why I have problems with this phrasing, let's see what we have here. And what we have, fellow viewers who don't enjoy tasteless similarity in their films, is a huge slap on our faces and our egos. This is what we can call a proper representation these days? I doubt it. It's so elusive I even didn't noticed it in the first place, thinking that the man could be talking about any people from his family. So, if I can read a text hermeneutically and headcanon some queer characters in there, does that mean a film has representation in it? Or, more important, does it mean director has the right to be bragging about such representation? Last one - certainly not.",negative

This film was good enough. Neatly ended the group of films. All these low ratings. Kinda baffles me as it was a well made superhero film. I suppose it's not for everyone.,positive
What an amazing film! I wouldn't change a thing about it. The film is very long but worth every minute. A good mixture of comedy and action.Advice: go to the toilet before you watch it!,positive
"This is where everything we've watched comes together and it is a thrilling movie experience. Although still not as good as the original avengers film. It is truly impressive how everything is blended beautifully with a mind flowing finale. Sure the time traveling stuff feels a little unnecessary but it works for the overall story. Its complexity gives all the performers here some inspired moments. I mean it was one hell of an experience being in the theater opening night and watching the audience go insane. This too me feels like the end of these films and although it goes on just a bit too long it ties everything up nicely.Budget: $356m
Box Office: $2.797B9/10",positive
Great film for me but the start let it down. It seamed to me that there was 10/15 minutes of film left out at start to get it to a 3 hour film and that missing bit let it down. Usually there is a good scene or 2 introducing a new character to the others like but the introduction of the new character at beginning was a little dropped on you. And I think they had to use the trailer to fill this void.,positive
"I absolutely love this movie! This film totally blew me away with such a remarkable story! To those not so true believers of marvel who thinks this film is not worth the money and say that it's not the greatest film ever. YOU SUCK! As a filmmaker I really appreciate what the Russo brothers did! Thank you Russo brothers for another great Marvel film! And god bless Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko for creating such remarkable characters that has touched my heart!",positive
"Really, people think this is like 8.9?This means i am really getting old. I love Infitinty war and i went to the theater like super-hyped. During the movie i wanted to like everything, then when it was over I thought, man it was bad. I am sad, how is this possible?I am ok that this is being bad. But why people think it is ~8-9?
it is a good 6 max 7, but noooo...",positive

"Just came back from my viewing and wow, what a bitter taste in my mouth. This 3 hour flick was supposed to be the biggest one yet and there was so little. The fun finally kicks in after 2 hours and 15 minutes. Everything before that was pretty boring. It's honestly not as ""amazing"" as people made it out to be. It was genuinely a one-and-done movie. Don't get me wrong I like some of the MCU movies, but I had a better time with Infinity War than with this installment. I don't think I could see myself paying for this movie again any time soon.",positive
"I'm an Avengers fan but to me, Endgame was the worst part. Infinity war was much better. Even the action scenes are incomparable. Only 4 stars!",negative
"Spoiler Free!Was endgame good? Yes
Was endgame fun? Per usual
Was endgame non stop action? Kind of
Was endgame $400 million to make? YesIf I gave you $400 million to make a movie it wouldn't be to difficult to pay top actors, writers and fund state of the art animations.Endgame is a relatively non-stop rollercoaster of Marvel nostalgia. Great end to a storied franchise? Kind of. This is nowhere near the cinematic greatness of LOTR: Return of the King. That was a true film through and through. Endgame is monster budget with 80% boring monologue and corny jokes. If that's what you enjoy then all power to you.Endgame has less action than any other Avengers film which I found incredibly disappointing and a let down.Would I recommend you to see endgame? Don't be silly, this is generational movie. Generational in the sense of big money, big actors, mega marketing and big answers to a beloved storyline of multiple hero's. Marvel movies are popular because we have been told by everyone we have to love them. If you have one bad thing to say about a Marvel movie, you will become more isolated than Tom Hanks in Castaway. Well worth a watch but please...pump the brakes.",positive
"I'm not sure where to rate this movie because there's a lot of different angles to it. There are many plot holes. There is some humor that doesn't work as well as I'd like it to. I don't believe it's the best marvel movie. BUT... this movie is awesome. Make me feel something real from just a screen and you've achieved something and the Russo brothers did just that. Yes, the time travel logic will definitely not be accurate if you take the ""time"" (see what I did there) to dissect it, but this film did something pretty new. It connected over 20 movies into one grand conclusion that pays off better than any other piece of media that I've ever seen. Problems with the flick? A few sure. Any resentment? Pretty much none. You can't please everyone, but these guys probably did the best job they could and I love them 3000",positive
"When my brother and I watched the film, it blew our minds away. Great fight scenes and of course the humor. I want to watch it again and experience the moment. Josh Brolin was excellent playing Thanos. This is the top #1 film in the box office and in cinema history. I hope this film will win an academy award for the 2020 Oscars. Loved it and enjoyed it! MARVEL RULES!!! EXCELSIOR!!!",positive
So as we know this is the last part of avengers series and for me after this no entertainment is left,positive
"My first reaction when I saw the endgame ending was I'm done with MCU and that was not not because of any bad moment that was because death of Tony Stark. There are some confusing moments that I am sure will be explained by upcoming MCU movies this was great movie.
Thank you Black Widow, Captain America and Iron Man.",positive
"This movie does everything right. I was so pleased and satisfied walking out of the theater, it's really hard to understate it. The Russo Brothers absolutely lived up to the expectations and delivered the epic conclusion we were all waiting for. You can probably nitpick this movie if you want (as you can any movie), but to me that's pretty much what you have to do to find flaw with it. I think that the emotions throughout are played so well and we get those moments with each character where they feel human, especially with all 6 of our original avengers. Each has their moment to shine and I truly loved it. The humor was well-used, the story made sense, the finale was downright perfect, and it was an all-around great movie!SPOILERS
My favorite stuff
The beginning with Clint's family was downright heartbreaking to watch, and a great way to bring that human aspect to the story, seeing someone who had no idea what was going on be affected by the snapThe subversion of expectation meeting thanos and realizing he not only doesn't have the stones but he doesn't carePaul Rudd. What a guy.The second act plot is really done well, it makes sense yet the way they go about it with the callbacks to almost every movie through cameos or reliving scenes is great, especially in the New York scenes (specifically the elevator scene from winter soldier being called back)-Black Widow dying is another expectation subversion and is done very well
Tony having a moment with his dad is great to seeThe way by which thanos is reintroduced as the villain is actually brilliant and gives a new perspective to his motivations and the way he destroys the facility after the reversal snap is greatCap picking up Thor's hammer is all kinds of yupGiving our main three some alone time fighting thanos is a great way to give them their time to shineAvengers Assemble is everything I didn't know I needed.Tony's arc is done so well and how he sacrificed himself reminds me so deeply of the scene in Avengers when cap said tony wouldn't sacrifice himself for others.Cap getting to dance with PeggyThor joins the Guardians!My negative stuff (these didn't really bother me that much but a little bit)
The whole fat Thor thing kinda makes some of the dramatic moments later on kinda weaker in my opinionSame with half-hulk, almost felt hard to take him seriously at first but it made more sense as the story grewNot sure I can buy thanos changing his mind for his plan to cleanse the universe by destroying it and starting over, but I like that he's willing to die for his own causewould've liked more action especially in the first act but I appreciated the emotions",positive
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a new American movie from 2019 and well do I really need to say a lot about the basics here? Maybe only a little bit as absolutely everybody should know by now who the Avengers are. I believe it is essential that you have seen the previous Avengers movie from 2018 in order to appreciate this one here. But you don't need to have seen everything before that from the Avengers universe by any means in order to understand this one here. Directors Russo and Russo are back and they also got their screen writers on board again here, but this is really not a surprise and accurate as this is basically a duology. Also despite the ending from the previous Avengers film, all the actors are back and with that I really do mean ""all"", even some that did not show up in the last Avengers movie, but in previous films from the universe. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer would be the best example, even if all of these really only have very brief screen time. And what was with that Robert Redford inclusion? Now that did feel a bit bizarre.Anyway, in this 3-hour(!) film the remaining Avengers are faced with the big challenge to find a way to turn things right again and when the option of time travel arises, this seems to be their only chance. Sadly, Thanos, the titan and main antagonist, who managed to erase half the universe in the previous film, finds out about the remaining Avengers' plans. It will be a tough battle. But one when there are new heroes on the horizon offering hope such as Captain Marvel Carol Danvers who just got her own movie not too long ago. That one featured a great deal of Samuel L. Jackson, who is almost unseen in this one here. But I mentioned Thanos already and would like to say a few more words about him now. I really loved him in the 2018 film, but in this one here, he was a bit underwhelming. I understand he is weakened because he destroyed the stones not too long ago and also does not really care too much because his mission is complete, but still the way we see him basically fight all Avengers at the very same time in the previous movie and here Captain Marvel alone can almost keep him under control at his neck. Or Thor out of nowhere severes his head. It just felt a bit too easy for me honestly. Now that I mentioned Thor here, he is in it pretty much for the comedy only this time as he has turned into quite a bum over the years when everybody is clueless how to bring the lost souls and friends back. And there are many other comedy-themed moments in here. You will laugh, but you will also be sad on some occasions. I will go into further detail about that statement in the next paragraph, so if you want to avoid in-depth spoilers, then now is the time to stop reading.I personally was more shocked by the death of Black Widow than by the death of Iron Man, perhaps because I have never been a huge RDJ fan in this franchise, even if I don't mind him either. And well, Scar-Jo plays in some films I quite adore, so it was sad to see her go, also because the build-up was very strong and you never knew if it was her or Jeremy Renner's character who would die. I like him too, so a loss-loss for me. Oh well I read Black Widow will get her own film soon, so I am curious how that turns out. 100% I'm gonna watch it. And at the end, when we find out about Captain America's personal decision how to spend the rest of his life, it was a bit sad and touching too, even if I think I read that Evans is finished with the franchise after this film. We'll see how his replacement does. I have a bit of a feeling by now they are really trying too hard to get African American actors in here for the sake of it. But maybe he can prove me wrong and he is actually good. Another scene I did not like very much was the female-power-centered one when we see virtually all female characters line up all of a sudden. That did feel cringeworthy and just for the sake of pleasing liberal Hollywood. But yeah, there were many really good moments that quickly make me forget about these, so it is all good. There were great moments without a doubt and I think the Avengers universe keeps going in style. But you should not expect this film to be as good as the last. I think it stays lower quality-wise. Stan Lee's final brief cameo was also rather underwhelming. May he rest in peace.Okay finally, the closing credits were kinda special this time because we also see the protagonists in a unique way and do not get the usual epilogue scene with indications to the next movie, but it makes sense as of course there is definite closure in this movie here and the Russos most likely won't return or if they will, they have no ideas yet what will come up next. It must be special to top Thanos and these two films for sure though. But yeah, the universe is restored, half of the civilization erased is back and Thanos is defeated, so time to take a breath for a little while. And pay attention to how it is those who survived the cleansing (Black Widow, Iron Man and Captain America) who are eventually those who can be called fallen, well CA only to some extent. I think it is not necessary to give you a recommendation here as you probably know very well how much you like superhero films. The one thing I think is essential though is that you must absolutely watch the 2018 film before seeing this one and then you can decide for yourself if you want to sit through another 3 hours on the subject or accept evil being victorious. Make the right choice for yourself. I give Avengers: Endgame a thumbs-up, but not a too enthusiastic one as before.",positive
"Well it's been a hell of a wait since Infinity War, but the Russo Brothers have delivered in spectacular style and quality.I loved this film in all its entirety and encourage everyone who goes see it to do a toilet check before the titles roll.It is an immense roller-coaster with many twists and turns.The studio keeps getting better and I hope it continues for years to come. Don't be dissuaded by the feature length of just over 3 hours, this is a MARVELlous spectacle for all to see!Make mine Marvel True Believers!! Full marks.",positive
"First things first - I would call myself a moderate Marvel fan. I have watched most of the movies and know enough about the plot and general lore to be able to watch the movies without going ""who the hell is this"" every minute.Having said that I think that the movie was average. Not bad. Not good. Just a film you watch and then forget about two days later. When I watched Infinity War in cinema I was pretty impressed - I wasn't dying over it, but for a superhero movie it introduced a lot of new ideas to the table.Endgame on the other hand just feels like a chinese takeover from two days ago you stumble upon in your fridge. Most of the plot is just boring. There is little to no tension, the action jumps all over the place, the actions of the heroes often make no sense at all. I am not a fan of time travel because it takes a lot of skill and precision to write a story that isn't chaotic. And Endgame didn't manage to convey a good time travel story - which is like what the whole movie is about basically.All in all I think Endgame might have been released a bit to early. They should have put some more time, thought and effort into it, especially when this movie was supposed to be the grand, spectacular finale of such a huge scale saga. A bit dissapointing.",positive
"Okay so I've loved most of the Marvel films leading up to this final phase, great, i loved Infinity War.So watching this film for the first time was okay, because the old characters coming back and so on is cool once only, after watching the film again i was really bored, like really bored until the end fight.So for me this film was literally 2 hours and 30 mins of talking and stumbling around not doing much then followed by a Infinity War style fight scene which yes was cool but nothing special for the end of this phase.But the main point i want to get across is how much was wrong with this film, there is so many things wrong, I'm not gonna sit here and type 10,000 words to bore you with so all i say is go onto YouTube or Google and lookup ""Things wrong with End Game' and i guarantee you will change your mind about this film, you will reliase that not much makes sense and you will then be sad that this film was the end.Even my friends thought it was good at first, they gave it a 10/10 but after they picked the film apart they even saw how bad it really is.Age 25 - Cinema: Stevenage iMAX 3D Double Bill Infinity War + End Game
Watch, Consider, Avoid - Watch because its a Marvel film and the last one but avoid once you have seen it once or as a stand alone film.",negative
"What a brilliant finale to a wonderful saga, the infinity war saga will surely go down as one of the great cinematic achievements of all time. Avengers Endgame brings together all the characters we have grown to love and finishes the saga in a spectacular way. WHATEVER IT TAKES",positive
"Endgame 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Don't watch it with preconceived notions of what it's going to be. Forgive it's minor faults, it's a bloody great super hero movie.",positive
"There will be a lot of people gushing on here about this movie. Make no mistake, it was good, just not great. 21 films leading up to this point have built the tension, and what should have been a sonic boom was closer to a car backfiring. At three hours, this is a long movie. While there are moments of great humor and great sadness and great happiness, it also dragged in spots. One would expect it to be 95% action, but they spent a lot of time on fluff. Again, do not misunderstand me. I liked this movie quite a bit, but I wanted to love it, and sadly I didn't.",positive
"This movie is 3 hours of fanservice, but it all comes from the best place possible: from the love of this franchise, it's characters and to reward the fans such as myself. So I can't rate it like I wasn't a fan. Sorry.Visually it's always the best you can imagine. The final fight is jaw-dropping, with some really ""must use as wallpaper material"" shots like Cap standing against Thanos and his army and such.
The cinematography is stunning and more stylish than ever. Like the blurred image of Thor leaving Thanos' farm house with that beautiful music at the end of the first chapter of the film.
The IMAX 3D really comlimented the visuals here and there, but it's not needed.
The music is most likely the best from all Avengers movies here, even if it's not memorable like it's always tend to be, it really helps the tone.
People tend to say this is not acting what these people do in the Avengers movies but try to talk with green screen or while your colleague has some weird bubbles on him/herself and make it believeable for the audience. Don't underestimate these movies people like Thanos did with the Avengers.
The characters are all at their best here, at least who are in the meat of the movie. And all the bring back characters has their very little, but effective moments. The tragic moments will shock you, the funny moments will make you laugh your ass off, and all the in-between moments will entertain you. A lot of encounters and re-connetions happen in this film and all of them varies to heartwarming to wholesome to touching. Tony's daughter's line that Tony gives her back at the end is wholesomely touching. There are no dull or unwanted scenes I could think of. Even if you disagree with some choices the directors made they still great ideas, and show a new side of the characters. There are so many callbacks to scenes or lines that will make you smile, warm your heart or even cry that I couldn't count. The story is more interesting than Infinity War and never sits down for a moment, but gives some breathing moments for you to buckle up for the next big one. The twists and turns are mostly unpredictable, even if you thought who will die, they die in a surprising way.And with the previous statement we came to the really spoilery part of the review:HUGE SPOILERS:
The 4 best parts of the movie were for me all about to give the best farewells to Cap and Tony.
1. Cap uses Mjölnir in maybe the best coreographed and most heavy fight with Thanos is just a scene were you can't do anything else just cheer and be happy to live in this age.
2. Tony dies with the most memorable fashion, saying ""I am Iron Man"" to Thanos after we've seen the most satisfying scene ever: Thanos tries to snap but nothing happens, becasue Tony has the gauntlet he made with all the stones. And Pepper telling Tony at his final moments that everyone is safe and he can rest now made me genuinely cry the first time sitting in a movie theater.
3. Tony's funeral on the river where his house stands, with all his friends watching and the audience reading the text stating that there's the proof Tony Stark had a heart with his iconic chest plate is made me cry even more.
4. Cap finally goes back to Peggy to compliance his promise and dance with her is the perfect ending scene to his arc, and to this Golden Age of Marvel Cinema.
SPOILERS END!The only negative is that you didn't had to watch Captain Marvel for this movie, but that's not the movie's fault, but the false advertisement's. She doesn't contributes much, really dull and uninteresting but at least has really few screen time. And she does her job, being powerful and not stealing the show from the older characters who deserve the spotlights. Her hair is ultra lame tho, even if it was a reference to her late mentor. I could've be picky and say some characters could live if they used the stones and qauntum realm, butt that would've just destroy their character arcs in an instant. It works in movies like Deadpool where there are no rules, but not here. And for some of the characters really needed to die, and fulfill their purpose in the grand story.I could just go on and on what I loved about this movie, but that would be just boring and you will watch this movie even if you don't read a random 22 year old guy's review on the internet. So there are my closing thoughts on the movie and the Avengers franchsie in general.The Avengers in 2012 showed us something new and never done before, Age of Ultron with it's problems was a likeable and entertaining movie that had some great groundwork for later movies, Infinity War made the impossible come true, and Endgame complimented the fans of the series the best way possible that everyone will remember as the next decades come. Thank you Russo Brothers, the Avengers cast, everyone worked on these movies (even the weaker ones) and especially for Stan Lee to made my childhood dream possible... f.u.c.k. I'm crying even while writing this review. So it's time to END it here. Thanks for reading.",positive
"Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation.",positive
"Avengers End Game is about sacrifices. The first Avengers movie was about the challenges of having power. Age of Ultron was about unintended consequences. Infinity War brought those two themes together when almost the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe was faced with the challenge of the mad god Thanos. Endgame starts in the aftermath of that event.The initial mood is one of sorrow and remorse. Stark for example, talks about ""losing the kid"" aka Tony Parker-Spider Man (Tom Holland). There are support groups for people to talk about their losses, which features a cameo by Joe Russo, one of the co-directors. Clint Burton (Jeremy Renner) was even turned into a killer as a result. Everyone was completely devastated by Thanos.Sacrifice is then introduced when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) returns from the Qauntum Realm and tells the Avengers that time operates differently there. If they could manipulate the realm, they might be able to go back in time and reverse Thanos' act. Different characters then have to give up something to carry out this task. Tony Stark for instance, has to leave not only his wife Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), but his young daughter as well. One of the team has to sacrifice themselves to attain one of the Infinity Stones. Others pay in different ways.Going to the past also allowed Marvel to pay homage to its previous movies since this marked the end of that whole first generation. The first place visited is New York City when the Avengers were formed and fought off Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and the Chitauri. There, Banner runs into the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), and Stark and Captain America (Chris Evans) come across a bunch of Hydra agents working inside SHIELD that were seen during Captain America Winter Soldier including Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). Then Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) go to Asgard during Thor: The Dark World where the Thunder God gets to reconnect with his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) visit Morag from the first Guardians of the Galaxy, while Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Barton go to Vormir seen in Infinity War. There's even one extra flashback where Stark gets to meet his father (John Slattery) and Cap sees Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), which is some foreshadowing.The film is still able to throw some laughs in despite the general feeling of loss. Scott Lang for example, says they should be able to travel through time as long as they don't break the rules, which come from Back to the Future. Then when they experiment Scott gets transformed into a pre-teen, an old man, and then a baby. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) declares that a win. What really steals the show however is the depressed Thor. That is one of the funniest things I've seen. There's a great line where Stark says Thor reminds him of Jeff Bridges from the Big Lebowski. It turns out Thor has some problems with players on Fornite as well that's worth some laughs.Of course, there's a big giant battle at the end that has some fantastic parts such as a whole army coming to the rescue to back up the Avengers against Thano's forces. All the female heroes forming up to push through the bad guys, and a great exchange between Cap and Thor.Really, every Marvel movie up to this point was leading up to Endgame and it delivered.",positive
"Too slow. Too boring. Way too long. Too much drama. Seriously did we have to delve into everyone's past? And every team that went back for the stones encountered universe shattering difficulty. Wow so original. What was Marvel thinking? I had high hopes for this finale but it definitely did not deliver. The actors delivered respectable performances. Unfortunately they were hampered by a 2nd rate script. And where was the humor of Ant-Man and Ragnarok that endeared us all to these famous characters? Dullsville. It was almost shameful the way Hulk was marginalized. Yeah I know all the legal garbage behind him not getting a solo film. But here was a chance to show us what he can do and you failed, Marvel. Speaking of Marvel, she was about as inspiring as Ben Stein. I did not care for Larson's rendendtion of the character anyway so her minimal impact was Ok by me. Sorry but this movie was very underwhelming. Too bad.",positive
"Characters
I hate captain marvel such a lame character she is sepose to be the strongest,c'mon,what a load of bullp*ss.The rest of the characters was awesome especially Tony Stark aka iron man he stole the show as usual and of course Thor and so on...Story
The ending made me cry😭😭 so yeah that's all.Comedy
Only few jokes landed especially Thor's but most of em was lame.The bad thing about this movie was that after I watched it a few times it got so boring and I only watched it three times. The story made less sense and the jokes just got so more bad. This is definitely not the best avengers movie just because it's the last one doesn't make it the best.Yeah so that is my review. Great on your first watch but bad after your second or third.",positive
"They try to be different but it just doesnt do it for me. I already dislike Infinity war and the first half of this movie confirm my view. The first act of this movie should have been included in the infinity war. And that would make infinity war the perfect movie... Why? Just why are they doing it like this? Cut some unnecessary scene in the infinity war to get that 3 hour screen time and then end the film with Thanos head. We will face the shock of reality that even when they defeat the villain, its not enough. The world already changed. And then start the sequel, 5 year after, with that time travel plot. And rework the movie with a better story, or if you can, just give a brief explaination about the time travel plot so that it didnt resulting in a huge paradox like this. For movie goers the current plot is okayish but for scifi nerd this is unacceptable. The lost of one of the avenger is a pure tearjerk but the other one doesnt make any sense. It could have been done better with a different character.
Overall it is okay for entertainment if you dont think too much about it. But I feel unsatisfied with what they are doing. I really do feel it could be better.",positive
"What have they done wrong with this movie ""everything""
They have turned Thor & Hulk into joke characters the whole movie feels hurried and confusing the CGI is poor on more than one occasion a lot of MCU characters are more cameos than necessary.I enjoyed the early Marvel movies but the most recent ones are ruining the franchise how they made so much £££ out of this is baffling it only gets more confusing the longer you watch it.I am not sure why so many cameos were necessary as Captain Marvel was all that was needed.",negative
"You'll cheer, you'll laugh and you'll cry.But most importantly, you will enjoy.Avengers: Endgame turned out to be more than wished for and delivered all the action, humor and emotions balanced in a perfect manner.One must not forget that it's not a standalone film and due to that, the slow pace in the first half can be understood. It will however not bore you for even a second, that's for sure. All action sequences are masterfully crafted and choreographed, further backed not only by the CGI but also a strong thread of emotions that seems to drive everything in this film.The directors have dealt with the characters quite well. All performances are impressive, but Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans truly win hearts. If you've been following all MCU movies since Iron Man (2008), there's no way you won't like it.It's a great action movie, a great comic book movie, a true crowd-pleaser and possibly the best superhero movie, but first and foremost, it's... it's a...I'm speechless.",positive
"Excellent, the Best of the Best !
Great 10 years of MCU 🍷",positive
"What's funny about Endgame is that it's actually the first Avengers movie where they do in fact 'Avenge'. After the Thanos snap, half the population of the universe disappeared and thus creating the biggest problem the team has ever had to fix. Luckily, Scott and Tony figured out a way to time travel, to undo the snap and attempt to bring back all the people they lost.It's tough to comprehend just how good this film is. On one hand, I do have some minor issues with the middle act as well as questions about all this time travel and the lack of ramifications. However, on the other hand, (and I hate making this as an excuse) but it is a superhero movie after all. How much do you forgive a plot hole here or there? The answer lies with how well you like the 3rd act. Because I do believe the last 45 minutes is some of the best film ever put to screen. The amount of pay-off and satisfaction you get as all 22 films have led to that moment is something I will never forget. I've seen the film twice now, and I nearly teared up merely seeing the portals open, among about 10 other small moments that moved me as well.Of course the MCU will go on and make more billions upon billions as the universe continues to expand, but it won't be the same. We'll never get another core Avengers movie with this cast, and no matter how much or little your invested in the MCU, that has to mean something to you. It made the middle act worth it when the heroes go back and have to relive certain events that we've seen play out in other MCU films. But naturally, that act of the film does play out slower and more plotting than anything else. You certainly feel the lack of Thanos during those sequences. And I think that was my biggest gripe, the antagonist (Thanos) is only really there in the beginning and end, so you never feel true danger that our heroes aren't going to recover the stones for use one more time.With that said, I think the original crew truly give us their best performances yet, and that starts with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr., the heart and soul of this series. I'll admit I did not expect them to kill off only Tony and keep Steve alive, but their arcs are almost perfectly capped off here. Pepper says it perfectly to Tony ""We're going to be alright, you can rest now"".There's not a whole lot to this review, it' mostly just initial thoughts, but if I can stress one thing over anything else, it's thank you. Thank you to Kevin Feige, the Russo Bros, and everyone involved in making this and the other MCU films. It's been one of the greatest pleasures of my life seeing this universe unfold the way it has and it's hard to imagine not having the next phase of films already in the pipeline but Endgame puts a stamp on the end of this series like not other. This was something special, and I don't think we'll ever see it again.10/10",positive
"Man i was sooo exicted over this movie, but it wasn't what i expected at all. I wish i would've liked this more than i did, i want to love this movie so bad but i just can't. Im givin it an 8 just because i love MCU and i liked the battle in the 3rd act.",positive
"I am a post-90s generation, and I used to envy the ""previous generation"": audiences 40 years ago, the end of the Star Wars trilogy in their theaters; 20 years ago, audiences can see the ring in the theater The final chapter of the King series. The joys and sorrows of movie fans are not connected, but now we also have a common memory: Marvel Movie Universe. Thank you, Avengers.",positive
"This was the epic conclusion to 22 movies of the mcu and what a conclusion, the cinematography, the action, the emotions is just some of the amazing things in the best ever superhero movie",positive
"This movie was overall disappointing given the fact that there isn't really a satisfying moment. Nothing was shocking and nothing was new. Thanos no longer had any character or motive being reduced to yet another cliche marvel villain. By the second half of the movie the heroes completely had the upper hand and the suspense is withdrawn. The one ""big"" death in the movie was cheesy and lacked impact.",positive
"Most excellent movie-verse ending with excellent war sequence at the climax. The war scenes are excellently directed and visualised. And also how the time travel has been handled is very good though not comparing with others. Everyone has their own time travel theories, we shouldn't judge. It is a movie which ends an era of MCU-phase-2.",positive
"I do enjoy the ending but I am quite disappointed with Endgame's whole execution.It felt like a slap stick comedy rather than the dark Avengers movie it was supposed to be. I don't mind jokes here and there, like in Infinity War, but it was a lot of it, even til the point that I found it disturbing.Thor and Thanos was quite redeemed in IW but their portrayals here feels like a slap in the face. Are MCU even aware that Thanos was so well written that he has a fanbase?This isn't a worthy ending for Phase 3 and MCU as we know it. It was just OK.",positive
"The Russo Brothers will be forever known as the directors that failed a franchise and insulted the very fans that embraced it.I have no idea why they felt their finished product would pay homage to Stan Lee's legacy or the characters he brought to life but this ""closure"" to a decade of greatness was, in fact, the most disappointing 3-hours of character assassination in cinematic history.",negative
The pacing was slow in the beginning but overall I enjoyed this. I don't like what they did to some characters but everything that Dr. Strange saw had to happen for them to win.,positive
"Endgame is an epic adventure , emotional roller-coaster with full of plot twists and conclusion to all that 11 years of storytelling. while watching #endgame I was laughing so loud, clapping so hard and got emotional in the end.
What an experience!
Sooo Goood.",positive
"I had been out of the loop over Marvel movies for too long until I watched this movie, then I decided to watch all the previous ones. I have yet to pull that off, but nonetheless I wanted to go back and watch this epic conclusion again with the benefit of hindsight and it never ceases to be so awe-inspiring.The other movie I watched a second time was ""Interstellar,"" by the way.This time I'm scaling the rating up from 8 to 10.Looking back you can't help marveling at the unrivaled labors of 12 years and 22 movies from Marvel Studios. They really did create a wonderful world of their own.And to remember how naive Robert Downey, Jr. looked in the first ""Iron Man"" in retrospect, compared to where he wound up in ""Avengers: Endgame"" - the giant on whose shoulders everyone else in this Marvel Universe stands - that is something that could not be said even of ""Star Wars.""Happy trails.",positive
"The ending of this great saga really reaches deep to tie up loose ends and make the ending a satisfactory, thirst-quenching resolution to what started so long ago-in a small cave somewhere-with a desperate Tony Stark and the birth of a hero.",positive
"The massive MCU 20 movies build-up over ten years ago culminates into a two-part epic finale: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) (21st movie) and ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) (22nd movie).Here it is, the final finale, filmed back-to-back with ""Avengers: Infinity War"".A 3hrs long love letter to fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it unifies the original core members of the Avengers that get new hope and motivation to undo the events from ""Avengers: Infinity War"".Some characters get their emotional moments, their catharsis, their revenge, their second chance, their new heroic mission.Forget about logic, forget about the rat that sparked the whole second part, forget about perfection.It's about heroes who lost their way and instead of going to the employment office because there is not really heroic work to do they are doing their usual daily tasks.After a dark and depressing half hour the story gets more and more enthusiastic, thrilling, humorous and action-packed till the finale.This movie is very different compared to the first part. It doesn't even feel like a second part. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" are complete movies of their own and quite independent from each other.That's good.My rating is 8 stars: It's not a masterpiece. The film is too cluttered in places, by the end it gets too hasty, too much fan service (p.e. The final battle reminded me more of the final battle in ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (2003)) and less storytelling as in the beginning and middle of the movie.But still: It's a very good movie with an excellent, stellar cast, some surprises and typical Marvel ingredients.",positive
This movie was great. Got a hummer when Thor showed up. Would recommend.,positive
"Then it wouldn't be rated as high. 3 hours was stretched, there was too many ""motivational quote"" moments and they forced a lot of the jokes. Other than that, the acting was good from the main cast and the point when they encounter one another was fantastically done.",positive
Sobbed. So much to take in. No words. Gonna watch it a millionth time more these few weeks.,positive
"You wont miss anything entertaining. I didnt know what to expect from this final film, but I certainly wasnt expecting to watch arguably the slowest moving Marvel movie ever made. Does it make up for it in that one epic fight scene? not really. So many other movies have done epic battles far better than this. Now I cant sleep properly cuz I got so much rest during Endgame!",positive
"Last week I wasted 3 hours of my life watching the latest Avengers movie End Game. I am a massive Marvel fan and have loved most of the movies up to now. Lots of action and fun. What has gone wrong. I was looking forward to this film so much but was so disappointed. If you want action and fun go watch John Wick 3, Wow that is a film especially compared to this dribble.Were do I start. At the start, or should I say for the first 30 min all the characters are depressed and feeling sorry for themselves. Then they mention time travel, yes time travel. I mean after all Marvels great films and ideas the best they could come up with to get things back to normal was time travel. What next, Ironman (Robert Downey Jr) wakes up back in Ironman 1 and the last 20 years have all been a dream aka Dallas style. Come on give me a break the best they could come up with was time travel. Anyway 1 1/2 hours into the film I turned to my friend and said the last 1 1/2 hours must be amazing as this has been so boring and all the reviews say this is a great movie. To my disappointment it did not get much better. In the 3 hours of running time there is at a push 30 minutes of action and that is at a push. The rest is just a load of rubbish.So disappointed, won't be wasting my hard earned money on Marvel again.",negative
That is the sign of a good movie. From start to finish your basically glued to it. And the humor in it is better than expected. The action and special effects are above avg. Good story line to follow the previous movie.,positive
"Yes I gave this movie a ten ... like i gave to Good Fellas or Casino or Aliens or Terminator 2.
Why ? Because this movie is one of the best actions movies ever... CGI ... Actors... Story Directors ... are incredible.
Yes it cost 360.000.000 USD ... the most expensive movie ever ... but at least they made an incredible Superhero Movie ... Marvel understood from the beginning how to make an entertaining film. I like Zack Snyder but the DC Comics movies are just trying it to make it serious ...
Come one we want fights and funny conversations like in the comics ... The Story might be not 100 % in line or believable yeah give me a break we are talking about Superheros here ... they can do anything :)
I am now waiting for the 4 Bluray Box for the Avengers and the 3 Bluray Boy of Captain America ...
For me it ended now .... Great experience ... and I think it will take mabe some decades before they can do somethng like this again.",positive
"This movie, pretty much, had it all...great action and drama...heroic valor...and comedy, in all the right places...
plus there were great cameos...it's long, but it doesn't seem as long as it is because the pacing is very good...
definitely recommeneded.",positive

"After watching this twice, I understood the story of Avengers: Endgame. The Avengers failed after the Infinity War. Never in their lifetime faced an incredible and inevitable enemy like Thanos. Josh Brolin delivers a badass Thanos. He is smart, he did the unthinkable, and he made it tough for our heroes to restore the loss. Whatever it takes was the Avengers motivation. Huge sacrifices must be taken. Seeing the Avengers rise from hopelessness and failure is the most amazing feeling in this movie. The huge price was delivered and this movie hands down is the best movie of 2019. The final battle makes it epic.The Russo Brothers deliver a phenomenal film. I give them high praise for their direction and work to make this film the best. The actors and actresses are amazing, 22 movies in 10 years. All influenced into one movie. I love 3000.",positive
This movie is amazing and deserves as much love as it gets 10 out of ten.,positive
"For me the movie felt different than other marvel movies. The pace was slower overall. Cannot say I was fully entertained thoughout the entire movie. Trying to give all the characters an adequate screentime and development made this movie so long and wasnt benefical for the tension. It felt really stretched at some points.Thor is literally a joke in this movie. One of the most developed and powerful characters we have seen in the past. Would have expected him to beat the **** out of thanos and his troops, but he was pretty much useless in retrospective. Instead we have Captain Marvel that outshines the other characters powers by far, plus no one wants to see this because she is just flat and unappealing.I also expected more of Thanos, his sudden change of mind wasnt very relatable after the determined / balanced seeming Thanos weve seen in the previous movie. Some things just felt underwhelming about this movie.",positive
"I saw this in the theater, It was awesome, and just when you think it can't any better it does...",positive
"Let's get this straight from the start: Infinity War is far more entertaining and a better film overall.Endgame is a nice way to send off the storyline with a fan service movie, giving some nice nostalgia for the previous Marvel films in the series and the characters we've come to know and love, but there are many problems with the overall plot and film itself.It would take quite a while to go in to it in too much detail, but to put it simply: Infinity War was also a long movie, but never felt long. I check my watch after what turned out to be 1 hour of Endgame and couldn't believe there was still another 2 hours to go.It's possible I'd hyped it up to myself too much beforehand, but even then, plot points would have annoyed me regardless. I'd say the overall feelings afterwards were: nostalgic, sad (I admit to some tears), happy, ""it was alright""... but ultimately a little disappointing and frustrating.",positive
"This was a terrible film. I rented it and feel like I wasted my money. The movie is 3 hours long. 2 of those hours is just nonsense, comedy, and jabber. Then you get about thirty minutes of the big fight, followed by another thirty minutes of boredom. The male heroes are portrayed as buffoons, which is indicative of today's masculine-man-hating society. Based on today's man-hating culture, testosterone is evil. Women should be lumberjacks and Seal Team Six. Men should take estrogen pills and ask their wives to open the stuck peanut butter lid. I'm a proud sexist. I open doors for ladies. I also send my lady flowers just because, versus craftsman tools.This was one of the worst Avengers installments ever. Writers are so busy pushing their masculine-man-hating agenda by making the two most powerful Avengers (Thor and Hulk) water downed buffoons. They failed to capture the essence of the Avengers. If the Hulk and Thor are not smashing something or someone that is extremely powerful, Marvel isn't worth watching IMHO. They are the ultimate warriors. Yet in this installment, they are childish buffoons while the film piles on the feminist propaganda scenes.The nadless, testosterone-hating writers of today have devolved the Avengers franchise into a dramady sitcom.",negative
"This movie is so close to be perfect!! sooo close!!! you will find some mistakes... some bigger than others... but in general, this movie is smart, visually amazing, will make's you laugh and cry...So... SPOILERS?!The movie start showing you what happens to some of the characters, some people find this part ""slow""... but for me was more than ok... Then... the preparation for the time travel and infinity stones heist start.This is the ""smart"" part... they found a way to use the stones in a way that don't affect the other movies, or at least that's what they try, for me this is the part they ""F""up things... there are some timeline nightmares after this movie!! things that affect characters in this movie, and even in the entire MCU.But apart from that, this movie deliver!! and deliver damn hard!!! the epicnes of the battle is ""a la"" Lord of the Rings"" but ""F""ing bigger!!! almost every character is here!! is like seeing ""Ready Player One""... everyone is on-screen and you don't want to blink your eyes, because you can loose something!More than one character will die... and those scenes are damn sad... if you are all-in in the MCU, you will cry!!!I give it a 9 just because the time travel mistakes, but more because Captain Marvel... omg... she's so powerful!! that is painful... marvel is going on a path that I don't want to go... I mean... I love Scarlet With, The Wasp is damn badass! even if she's just a human on a suit... but my favorite is Black Widow! just a regular human... no powers, no amazing gadgets... but Captain Marvel? she don't belong to the same universe... there is no logic's on why she's so powerful! and after investing more than 10 years on those characters, Captain Marvel feels more like Captain Mary Sue. THANKFULLY she don't do that much... but you can see how Mary Sue she is anyway.AMAZING MOVIE!!! the (almost) perfect way to close this incredible story... A MUST SEE!!!!!!!",positive
"All in all it's a very good and entertaining movie and the 3 hours felt like less than 2 hours... but in my opinion the Avengers found the solution to the problem just too fast and easy: ""We need to travel back to the past, so we get the stones""... one day later: ""Done, got them!""... like nothing special.",positive
"Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team.",positive
This was the single greatest Marvel movie I've seen ever and it has everything that you could ever ask for in a finale.,positive
"I think this is the perfect ending, but of course there was tv shows, but it is so good and tearmaking, iron man's death scene is the most perfect scene in a film, and despite it's 3 hour length, it still is amazing. I would give it a 10/10, but the shows were pointless.",positive
"Sitting at home today watching avengers : endgame and it struck me what a truly remarkable job marvel have done pulling this franchise off and finishing this phase with the most spectacular film you me or anyone has ever seen!
Sure it has holes in the plot big enough to fit entire universes through but who cares?
It's about a film studio carrying enough about its story line to thread together 10 years of work to make it worth the audiences time and money to invest for the pay off of a life time!
When captain America utters the ""avengers assemble"" line you know it's for keeps and the fight seen that follows is worth the admission aloneLike or loath the mcu but there's never been a better wrap up end to such a giant storyFingers crossed the next 10 years of mcu has an ending movie half as good!",positive
Infinity war had a massive build up and then the disappearance happened. In this they defeat Thanos in 2 minutes like he's nothing? I know he doesn't have the stones but he's still powerful. Then the rest of the film is about time travelling which felt like a cross between interstellar and The Leftovers. There wasn't really any great action scenes. The ready player one type battle at the end was good but apart from that a lot of the scenes were rehashings of old movies. I know there going back in time but I still wanted to see something original and new. It just didn't blow your mind like Infinity War. There's a lot of sob story to it. Very corny too and at 3 hours long it is exhausting. Also one of the least funniest marvel films. The one liners were lame and some fell flat. Basically Infinity War set a bar and this didn't match it. RIP Stan Lee.,positive
"Robert Downey Jr.'s gaunt Tony Stark records his message to his beloved Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, aboard the disabled spaceship last seen in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", ""Part of the journey is the end..."" After 11 years of Marvel movies, Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo's ""Avengers: Endgame"" signifies the end of the journey with laughter and surprising poignancy. At one point holdout Avengers leader Natasha (former assassin Black Widow), played by beautiful soulful Scarlett Johansson, refers to the Avengers as ""family"". That resonates for us, too. For the last 11 years these screen Heroes have become family. We care what becomes of them. Do they find peace? Do they discover love?""Endgame"" screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely patiently crescendo to the showdown with seemingly omnipotent galactic villain Thanos, motion captured by malevolently measured Josh Brolin, whom defeated the Avengers, by wiping out half of all life in the universe using the Infinity Gauntlet possessing all 6 Infinity Stones. The climactic battle is visually astounding, and oh so costly. Yet, what inspires most about ""Endgame"" is family and heart.Most of ""Endgame"" takes place 5 years after Titan's Warrior Thanos decimated half the population of the universe, including about half of the Avengers. Here less is actually more. Where as in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", way too many Superheroes resulted in the kluged narrative, focusing on the surviving Heroes: Chris Evans's Captain America (Steve Rogers), Robert's Iron Man, and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, displaced God of Thunder, empowers the story. Brie Larson's all-powerful Captain Marvel charismatically emerges as the new Avenger. Too bad the Russo's couldn't leverage more for Brie. Then again, that might have been narrative saturation.Where ""Infinity War"" was so dour and so self-absorbed, ""Endgame"" has a wicked sense of humor. Mark Ruffalo's glasses wearing civilized green giant Hulk taking selfies with adoring teen fans is hysterical. Critical to restoring their fallen Heroes in Thanos's aftermath, the surviving Avengers utilize time travel in hopes of preventing Thanos from possessing all Infinity Stones. In the hilarious expository exchange regarding the effects of changing past and future events: ""This is not 'Back to the Future'."" No, it's not. And I busted out laughing.The human narrative touches in ""Endgame"". The distinct strength of the Marvel Universe Movies are its Actors. Travelling back to 1970, Robert's Tony Stark meets his estranged Father Howard, the genius engineer, played by earnest John Slattery. Howard has no idea that he's talking to his future son, because his wife is about to give birth. Robert's authentic compassion moves. Tony hugs Howard, who expressed doubt about being a good Father, saying, ""It'll work out."" Then you realize that was the only time the two had ever hugged. On that same trip back, Chris Evans's Steve wistfully gazes at Peggy Carter, played by captivating Hayley Atwell. Peggy is the forsaken love of Cap's life.Chris Hemsworth's Thor travels back to the Norse legendary Asgard to retrieve an Infinity Stone. He encounters his mortal Mother Frigga, the powerful sorceress played by beautiful strong Rene Russo, on the day she's to die. In a subdued joke, rotund Thor has seen better days, since failing to dispatch Thanos in ""Infinity War"". His loving Mom tells her son that she knows that he's suffered. Looking into his eyes Frigga says, ""The measure of the Hero is being true to yourself."" Amen.Really, ""Endgame"" is awesome, because of heart. In that Karen Gillan is understated power as the mostly machine Nebula, daughter of Thanos. Her Father had contested her against sister Gamora, played by brilliantly strong Zoe Saldana, for his love. Tortured and devalued Nebula, becomes ravaged with vengeance upon her Father. Yet, Karen makes us believe that Nebula's soul is worth salvation.Yeah, at 3 hours and 1 minutes ""Endgame"" is the restroom challenge. I kid, well sort of. Despite all that, I loved ""Avengers: Endgame"". It's the poignant, whimsical end of the journey. At least for me, the Avengers are my fictional Hero family. Like the characters on the wide screen, we all experience suffering, profound loss, joy, and triumph. In life, like Chris's Cap says, ""Take your baby steps... Move forward."" I for one shall remember the Avengers in my heart.",positive
"I trully an not exactly sure how i feel about this movie. After the huge surprise that was Infinity War, i genuinely didn't know if they could do something to top that movie. And... they didn't. Don't get me wrong Avengers: Endgame is a very fun movie that tries to be more serious than regular Marvel movies and just like Infinity War tries to balance a lot of different characters. The ending is a great tribute to RDJs iconic Iron Man role and it does feel like the massive conclusion of a cinematic universe that has been building up to this movie for more than 10 years. However it is flawed in many apsects. First and foremost, the movie has too many plotholes and honestly the whole time travel thing makes no sense if you think about it for more than a minute (granted that always happens with time travel but still) (also Tony Stark straight up invents time travel in an evening). Thor became a proper joke in this movie, which is a shame considering he peaked in Infinity War. Yes, it made sense for the narrative but they absolutely ridiculed him. Also i expected a bit more than fat jokes. Speaking of jokes the humour is good in this movie, but a lot of jokes just don't land... at all. As far as other characters are concerned, Black Widow is in the movie just to die and Captain America going in the past to live a normal life was a horrendous choice, and something extremely uncharacteristic of him. The rest of the characters were dealt with preety well, i especially liked what they did with Hulk, since having him be just a smashing machine again would be boring. My biggest complain though is surprisingly the action, which i found supbar ! Especially the final fight was just a massive chi slugfest, which makes sense considering there where so many characters on screen. Also the cgi is surprisingly weak on some points! I personally would have preferred if instead of another huge fight with a billion different characters and useless armies we got a showdown between the original 6 Avengers and Thanos and The Black Order, while the rest were fighting off the generic army. Thanos also felt a bit less threatening than before and also a bit more stupid and a lot more reckless. And the Black Order was barely even used, for some reason. Furthermore, a lot of moments clearly happened just for the sake a fan service, which i didn't like at all. Finally, though i enjoyed the direction of the film, i found the score and cinematography to be good but extremely basic. All in all, Avengers: Endgame serves as a nice conclusion to a massive chapter of a franchise, which however features a plethora of flaws amd ultimately doesn't bring anything new to the table. I'll give this movie a 6.5/10",positive
"Spoiler alert, so read at your own risk.
I though the latest title couldn't get much worse, until I watched Endgame.
Again, a movie that looks like a computer game, this time since the script failed to innovate, it goes back to the previous movies ""Back to the future"" style.
A fat Thor playing Fortnite, a Mjornir that any bloke can use, including the strange duck face Captain ""never gets his suit right"" Strangelip.
A captain that gets old and delivers his shield to the flying ""never had an impact role"" birdie. An intelligent nerdy Hulk who lost all his grace (a green Mark Ruffalo on steroids and that's it).
The list goes on and on, starting slooooow in the beginning to end in the yet again climax of the ""playmobil-bring the action man and all the transformers"" battle in the end, with depressing results and laughable deaths.
Bring the wife and put her on an iron man suit, hell bring the smurfs, the ""useless on this flick"" Black Panther and friends, Popeye and your dog if you want.
This is trash ""cinema"" in the making. let's skeese the money-cow with poor scripting, terrible CGI and ruin every child's fantasy regarding what is what and whom is whom on the ""Marvel"" universe.
Marvel, you were sold to Disney, get ready for your next princesses, easy jokes and death of your child heroes.",negative
"The amazing fight scenes and CGI aren't enough to mask the fact that the overall plot of going back in time to change reality is just plain stupid and lazy - and this is addressed to the writers. I did know that there was gonna be some time travel involved, but the way Marvel explained and executed it didn't too well for me. They can't get away with just putting it all in ""Quantum.""",positive
Just wow. This is the 1st time I have watched a movie and everybody clapped at the end of it. It is one of if not the best movie I have ever seen. No wonder it is breaking records. I will go and see it again,positive
"As a Marvel fan, all I can say is that I am very much thrilled, and satisfied with how the Endgame turned out. The CGI was great, the story on point, and it brought back to life all the superheroes that I love.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is a film directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. This film was my most anticipated one for this year for a number of reasons. The trailers got me pumped up and increased my anticipation even more. But after walking out of that cinema hall, I felt that the creators did justice to all that was served to us in these past 10 years.Plot: The Avengers decide to reverse Thanos' action done during the events of Infitnity War.Story and direction: As this will be a non-spoiler I shall try to be as generic as possible as tio what I liked and didn't like about this movie. This film is a conclusion to a long story arc that started in the beginning of this cinematic universe. Yes, the film is three hours long (by far the longest in the MCU, too) but the best thing about the film was that the film never felt that long. And, for that, I would like to give a big salute to the creative minds behind this mega-blockbuster. In each and every minute of the move, you do feel for the characters. There is a sense of human-ism which is quite rare in superhero movies, which I was a big fan of. None of the scenes felt misplaced or unnecessary. I even liked the risks that were taken with characters which too is very rare for a commercial movie. The MCU brand of humour is there in some moments and I just loved them. This film had a proper balance of tension, entertainment and laugher, which is what wants from any kind of movie. Talking about the action scenes. OMG!!! They were huge, awesome and fantastic. Also, the VFX. My God!!! I can imagine the VFX artists had to do to bring so many of these scenes to like. And I salute them in doing that in the most seamless and effortless way. Alan Silvestri has also done a wonderful job on the score. I don't remember tearing up in any movie, but I surely did in this one. This film had such a profound effect in me. But in saying that, there were some scenes that did feel like plot-holes. Also, with the announcement of so many movies and TV show spin-offs this film still didn't manage to address so many things. But these, things are any way secondary to me.Performances: Now if I list each and every cast member and their performances, this review will go on and on. But still, I will do some highlighting. People have been wanting Robert Downey Jr to be nominated Best Actor for the Oscars next year. And I really hope they do because this was the best of Tony Stark in the MCU. Chris Evans as usual is fantastic and I saw a side of him in this film which wasn't even tapped on in this universe. Chris Hemsworth was the funny man in this film. His scenes just made me laugh. Same can also be said for Paul Rudd. Mark Ruffalo too was just great as the Hulk and Bruce Banner. Scarlet Johannson and Jeremy Renner made me remember what made them so special and unique in this team. Josh Brolin again was fantastic as Thanos. All the rest of the cast members too were just great and commendable.Favorite Scene: This is where I am out of words. But I will say it anyway without giving away anything. I will say it will be the one during the final hour of the movie where you will feel that are heroes have nothing to do. But then there comes a ray of hope and you feel that victory will surely touch our heroes' feet.
Verdict: Is this film perfect? No, absolutely not. Does this film satisfy the MCU fan? Hell yes, it absolutely does. This film just made me realise why I love movies and why my love increases every day. Its exactly for films like these that I live for. Do watch the film in 3D (IMAX, if possible) for the best experience and I am sure you will have a smile on that face yours feeling a sense of completion and happiness. If the MCU has more films up in its kitty, bring them on because I seriously would like to see what more can they give. Yup, and for the first time ever: NO POST CREDITS. So don't need to wait till the end waiting for some random scene to show up.I am going with an 8.5/10.",positive
"The end of an era, Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war-aftermath reflection, & one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster history. 9.4/10....
10 years, 21 movies, 32 heroes. The MCU as we know it just came to an end, and did so as epically as one could have possibly expected. Avengers: Endgame is one of, if not THE best and definitive Marvel film - and absolutely warrants the hype.The film opens into a desolate landscape post-Infinity War where our heroes are still coming to terms with the magnitude of their failure. Despite glimpses of levity-full psychological war aftermath reflection on topics like survivor's guilt and PTSD, I'll admit: I was mildly disappointed with the first act. Overly comedic and light-defused in tone, it's a bit discordant with the tragic events that just happened to trillions of life forms. It was also a bit anticlimactic having them find and confront Thanos so easily and early. However, these flaws are mostly sequestered in the first third (despite a weird intellectual Hulk and fat Thor just horrifying to watch), and are ~easily forgiven in light of what follows.Everything after the first act is masterful, dazzling fan service on a massive scale that will leave any Marvel or superhero fan speechless with their jaw-dropped. The middle act's time travel plotting makes for some incredible scenarios visiting past MCU films and having heroes interacting with their past selves. This was the magic of DC's Flashpoint comic arc, and although the film borrows its idea, it executes it perfectly. Thrillingly paced are the signature smooth-fluid action sequences The Russo Brothers are known for and exhibited ever since The Winter Soldier, as well as strong direction and intricate handling of such a monstrous scale of a story arc trying to beat Thanos before he even knows what's happened.The Avengers once again find solace in the splitting up of them into mini-teams leading to some hilarious and intriguing character combinations different from Infinity War. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye now Ronin, and the rest of the original 6 (plus a few others) are sent off into different teams and time periods to retrieve the stones, and it makes for some incredible entertainment value alone worth the price of admissions to watch. The Easter Eggs and cameos are downright legendary, showcasing what we already learned in IW: Anthony and Joe Russo are huge Marvel junkies who know and love the films/comics as much as the person reading this review.Thanos and his far darker tone. Thanos is also off scouring for the Stones while all this is happening. His pulling of the strings in things like sending rogues and strategically planting things to upset the Avengers' plans make him far more imposing than his rogue commando style in IW. Much akin to what Darkseid - DC's original titan/god that came out first and, yes, Thanos was cloned from - would be like, there's far more power in resources at your disposal and being able to fling them at your will. He also has a bite and far darker tone here, being pissed off The Avengers are wrecking his plans after knowing he won and promising to not only kill half of life now, but ALL life and start over again under his rule.Finally, the final act. I cannot even find the words to describe how legendary the final act of Endgame is - it might be one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. Like the Wakanda war on acid, this massive scale battle starting with the three most iconic Avengers against Thanos and evolving into a sheer epic warzone with every Marvel character you could possibly imagine, it will leave any fan speechless. And that's nothing compared to the heart-breaking ending with sacrifices that do the characters proud and have potentially-massive implications for the future of the MCU.Overall, while there are nits to pick from its ~anticlimactic humorous opening to its handling of Thor/Hulk to its lack of a post-credits scene (REALLY wanted an X-Men or Eternals tease..), Avengers: Endgame is an absolutely masterful film that delivers just about everything you could expect from it as a follow-up to Infinity War. The end of an era, Avengers: Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war aftermath reflection, and one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. It will be dang near impossible to wait to see what comes next.Overall Score: 9.4/10",positive
"Sidenote: this again is a review for a film I am writing as college homework so do bear with me for any SPAG errors.Welp, it has been a good 11 years of the MCU with some amazing films, sure there might be some bad movies such as Iron Man 3 and Captain Marvel but other then that the MCU has had many impressive films and now we come down to the endgame. Ever since 2008 there have been around 22 movies and now we probably have the best movie of the MCU in my opinion although, it is on a sub-par with infinity wars. I also felt very emotional because of a death of a character specifically an avenger not going to say who otherwise I might spoil too much.I finally got around to seeing it yesterday and I am completely mind blown. I was very disappointed with Captain marvel day before yesterday when I watched it but after this movie I am fully happy. I remember saying that Avengers Infinity Wars was the best movie of 2019 at present.If you have not caught up with the MCU like my sister was yesterday or if you haven't watch Infinity wars yet I recommend you watch all those first because to understand this movie you need to understand them first. Also, this review is filled with spoilers so if you don't want to get spoiled get out of my review right now and watch those movies before you continue reading. Cause this movie is going to be hard not to spoil.So, endgame takes off where infinity wars ended/ant man and the wasp post credits scene, when everyone but a few avengers disappear. It had been 3 weeks ever since Thanos wiped out human life on the earth, they find out where Thanos is hiding Thor kills him because he got rid of the infinity stones. They also take the infinity gauntlet with them.5 years laterCaptain America, War Machine and Black Widow are still figuring out what to do? Thor goes his separate ways, Hawkeye becomes a vigilante in Tokyo still grieving over his disappeared family, Iron Man starts a life with Pepper and has a daughter, Hulk mixes his brains and brawns together, Thor alongside the Asgardians and ant man finally escapes the microzone only to find out that Thanos invaded the earth and wiped out the population.They realise the only way they could restore everything is if they go back in time and stop Thanos from getting the stones so each of the avengers have a pym particle which can send them back in a moment in time before Thanos got to them. I enjoyed this scene because it gives me memories of each movie I watched of the MCU and makes me relive a few of their best moments. However, there was a high price for this.The effects in the movie were good, the camera angel was excellent and the time and pacing of the story was good too. The cast including Chris Evens, Tom Hiddleston, Chris Pratt, Scarlett Johnanson, Elizabeth Olson, Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper, Robert Downy Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Tom Holland, Paul Rudd, Don Cheadle, Zoe Saldana, Evangeline Lilly, Chadwick Boseman, Karen Gillan, Tessa Thompson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Anthony Mackie , Rene Russo, Dave Bautista, John Slattery, Sebastian Stan, Hayley Atwell, Emma Fuhrmann (who knew after 5 years Cassie would become hot) Vin Diesel, Gwyneth Paltrow and everyone else did a good job as their roles. I am going to really miss Chris Evens and Robert Downy Jr as their roles.My only fault with this film is that there was a lot of talking in comparative to the last movie and a lot is going on at once. But that was my only fault.The best scenes in this movie are when we go back in the past and Steve gets to see Peggy again, Tony gets to meet his dad, the fight scene when Captain America gets to fight Captain America (I wonder how long that took for Chris Evens to film), the final fight between thanos and when War Machine calls ant man regular size man.This is possibly the best movie I have seen in 2019 I could even give it a 15, 50 or even 100 if I could. Thank you, Stan Lee (RIP), Kevin Forge and everyone who worked on this movie I really loved every bit of it.If you actually, decided to continue reading and haven't seen the movie it. Opps, but I still recommend you watch this movie.",positive
"This film directed by
Anthony Russ and Joe Russ
they are brothers. The action takes place in the space and on the ground. The acting was neither perfect nor terrible.I liked this film because there were good special effects, but some moments were boring, which I didn't even want to watch.In my opinion this film is not only for teenagers, but also adults can watch it, but if you don't watch other marvel movies, you can't understand anything.",positive
"Picks up 22 days after the climax of Infinity War with Iron Man and Nebula stranded in space and the others baffled as to what to do next. Antman re-emerges and they consider a new possible way forward.Fabulous conclusion, full of wit, sadness and wonder. Everyone is great, the effects are to die for and a very well produced line is drawn under phase 3 - let's hope phase 4 is half as good.",positive
"No spoilers.The movie had a nice closing of the past 10 years but is far from the best Marvel movie which I had hoped for.Infinity war is head and shoulders above it due to its high pace and perfect character combinations. Endgame is funny, emotional and provides more depth to main character heroes. However, leaves so many important things out of focus despite its 3 hour runtime. Also, surprisngly feels like the Russos missed many great opportunities to make the movie better.Go and see it! Still important piece if the puzzle.",positive
"This is the worst superhero movie that I've ever seen since Avengers Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel and the reboot of Fantastic Four. All of those movies are masterpieces compared to this heaping pile of trash.The only good thing that has come out of this movie is the memes. The pacing is agonizingly slow, the story honestly doesn't make much sense at all. The fact that the Russo Brothers and Kevin Feige himself have to spoon feed you how brilliant and amazing this movie is goes to show how.bad it truly is.The characters that we all once knew and loved have now become boring, robotic sleeves to Disney. They are just there for a paycheck at this point, and boy did they get a huge one for some lackluster, boring and honestly some of the worst performances I've seen on screen in my 24 years.Get ready to see Robert Downey jr. Acts like he is in a high school play with his children, the only genuine father figure that actually seems real is Jeremy Renner in this film, otherwise it is ridiculously boring, full of potholes, and it's just a giant flashback and re-use of old footage that honestly gave them material that they should have used differently.I'd like to say that we as Marvel fan's have been strapped in a chair. We can't move, the room is dark, and then Kevin Feige and The Russo Brothers turn on the blinding lights and all walk in with spoons in their hands. They then proceed to, one by one, spoom feed us things like ""This movie is a masterpiece."" ""The reason why that didn't make sense is because we forgot to put it in."" "" We're so talented. Please waste your money on our talentless, bland films that we only make to make toys, merch and statues that people pay thousands of dollars for."" "" We haven't completely checked out and are desperate for new talent."" As you slowly lose conscience and black out.If you're looking to be in pain, by all means go and see this movie in the theater, but if you'd like to skip the boring Parts like I did, rent it on DVD. It's not worth buying nor is it worth watching more than once as some people have. To those people, I pray that your brain's get better >¤<",negative

We have been waiting for this for so long since Iron Man started and the Avengers were created. A masterpiece that has undergone a decade in the making.,positive

"Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.Is Avengers: Endgame OK for children? If your child has seen any MCU film then they'll be OK with this. The film has fair number of bad words, but the violence is on par with what younger fans are accustomed to. For example, there isn't any one instance that's as graphic as when the monster ate the businessman in Shazam!, but there are sustained action sequences that might test those 8 years old who haven't seen an MCU movie before.",positive
"Even though it has some slow scenes, I was really moved by the character building, how the story was elaborately planned, and the heartbreaks that we had to endure along the way. I must say, it had an epic and emotional ending we never thought we wanted.",positive
"Movie has a little bit too much comedy. I wish it kept the dark and serious tone throughout the film. Anyways, don't go in expecting a lot of action though. Doesn't really have action until the final 45 minutes. Movie is a mix of Inception, Back to the Future, and Infinity War.It is a little bit too long though, and the first 40+ minutes were pretty slow.
8/10",positive
"This is going to be unpopular opinion but after reading many of these reviews, it may not become unpopular. I will do the best I can to keep this spoiler free. There are obvious plot holes that will drive many MCU & non MCU fans nuts. Also, the movie starts off very slow and never really takes off for 2 hours. While there were emotional scenes & good actions scenes near & in the end of the film, it doesn't fully deliver its full potential throughout. Some of the superheroes barely get any screen time as well & you'll see why many people complain about Thor's obnoxious behavior. While it may to tempting to bash this movie to bits and give it a 5, I respect the ideas, acting, music, CGI, & work that was put into this. It definitely wasn't half a**ed but also wasn't completely solid either. Overall, you will most definitely be entertained and leave the theater with a smile on your face most likely but soon realize Infinity War is sooooo much better & more memorable due to its comedy, action, CGI, equal use of superheroes, plot, & the memorable Thanos. However, this movie didn't irritate me enough for me to hate on it. If you have kids tho, this movie will be a blast for them as my theater had kids hollering & emotional. 7/10 for my rating.",positive
"OK, here it goes. The number 1 movie in forever has had high expectations as far back as the beginning of the marvel movie universe, and I completely understand why. The previous movies have always been full of action and filled with all kinds of character development. However this is the final movie on this installment in this particular series. The last movie took several of our favorite heroes. Spiderman is gone, so are Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Groot and Bucky Barnes as well as others. So since so many of our favorites are dead what can we expect from endgame? Well, in the beginning everyone is mourning all the people who have died, unfortunately this takes up about the first 90 minutes of the movie. After we get passed the oh my God I am so sad that everyone died part of endgame we see our heroes set off to find the stones so that they can restore the universe back to the way it is supposed to be. Well Thanos will never allow this to happen, right? Well not exactly. While our friends, the Avengers set off to accomplish the impossible, it almost seems a little bit too easy at first. Sure you have a few issues, but they are the Avengers so they fix the issues rather quickly. Thanos, meanwhile is aware of what is going on and FINALLY takes action after the Avengers find all of the infinity stones. This is at the last 45 minutes or so of the movie. As the action takes place I couldn't help but think it had a Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars kind of feel. Now I won't give away the ending, but I will finish my review by saying that we lose 2 of the most iconic Avengers. Overall I enjoyed the movie, I wish it had less boohoo moments, more resistance and more action, however I am pleased with the finished product. The ending is a little bit sad and several people were crying. Hope you didn't read my review before seeing the movie. Enjoy Marvel Cinema fans. Action 6, plot 6 character development 7, cgi 10, ending 9 overall 8",positive
"Avengers: Infinity War better than this movie.
A film that cannot meet expectations.",positive
Not sure why they included all that time travel and extended fight scenes for. I think the advertisement was pretty effective when Tony Stark rolled up in his Audi. Just seems a bit overkill for a car commercial you know.,negative
"If you're a follower of the MCU like myself then you don't need to read any reviews to convince you to watch this movie, it's the culmination of years of movies and a must see for fans.
It's Filled with epic, emotional, sad and funny moments with tons of details for those who have been following all the previous movies, It's what you'd expect from a movie with this caliber and more.
I'm excited to see what the future holds for MCU and if it's going on with the same execution as this one then i'll be really satisfied.",positive
"Endgame has surpassed Avatar for the highest grossing film of all time. Not only this is the best movie in the MCU, this is probably the greatest movie of all time. How fascinating that Tony stark died after their mission was completed, the first 2 hours were great, the last hour was legendary. The story just didn't flow with me.Last hour is epic! Loved the ending credits sequence with each of the actors and their signatures. Definitely a wonderful film. I couldn't find much wrong with it outside of nitpicking. This is definitely a once in a generation experience but Natasha really hurts... that one still messes with me. After Iron Man's death ""Whatever it takes"" hits you a lot harder. I loved what they did with most characters. My only complaint being Steve and Natasha, but everything else I was satisfied with. I just wanna also say that if people are going to be disappointed with Tony creating time travel and Bruce helping out big time, then they're gonna have so many complaints with Mr. Fantastic if they end up adding him and the others into the MCU now that they have the rights. I absolutely loved the movie. Loved how well they gave me closure over the entire journey they've brought us on. One of my favorite superhero movies and one of my favorite movie going experiences so far. I really admire them sacrificing Black Widow over Hawkeye. Hawkeye has a family, which would have made his sacrifice sad, but in a very cliche way. Nat had NOBODY aside from the other Avengers. Someone who nobody besides the main heroes would mourn sacrificing themselves to save half of the universe is so much more powerful than it would have been with virtually ANY other Avengers character",positive
"Congratulations MCU on creating this 21-film cinematic feat. Was I expecting a better finish? Yes. Did I see the same movie as everyone else - it appears not.
[edit: I've rewatched the movie a month later and found it more satisfying. This was the version with the post credits stuff to get us back in to push the box office into record territory. It's exactly the same movie, mind you. The character arcs are just great and the actors up to the task. My 3 key problems with the fillem are 1; The camera work for the special effects sequences are thoroughly inventive BUT the camera work for the post-trauma character studies is not inventive at all. Those scenes relied on the multi-movie character arc and sentiment more than camera direction and cinematography. Still worked for the lass behind us who was sobbing for the last third of the moofie. 2; the story is great until the time travel gobbledygook when I felt the emotive aspect lost momentum. 3; it's still hard to care as much about MCU characters as much as, say, the original Star Wars characters because in the MCU you know there's another injection of super hero greatness only months away. In the original Star Wars moofies it was years before you saw any characters again so the emotional impact was more profound. OK, so these points are all probably shrewd directorial choices and generational differences. Impressive, ambitious fillem overall] I found this move a bit of a snoozefest. The problem is, by another other movie's standards this was quite a good film. It tried for different tones and a different pace. I think a part of the problem is these movies that they shoot back-to-back. They really need a break in between films to look at the first part, ie, Infinity Wart, and see what they set up in that film. They then need to sit down and answer all of the key points that were raised in that film AND in all the previous MCU fillems. That would require a multi-layered script and a production that really turns up the ante. To me it seemed like the series really ended with Infinity Wart and this Endgame was like, the ultimate post-credits sequence. The final battle was awesome but non-sensical. Who IS the most powerful superdude/ette and why can't she (MarVel) beat Thanos? That stuff frustrates me. I mean, I was ready for the Scarlett Witch to tear him a new one but even that hope fizzled.
I'll re-watch it on blu ray but I'm glad everyone else liked it. I'll always have my Return of the Jedi and Return of the King.",positive
"Finally after waiting for a year, we have Avengers Endgame. The final Avengers movie which was gigantic and groundbreaking. The Russos did a good job of showing how major the decimation was in the first film and how it affected the whole universe, because it affected us too. The Avengers launch a mission to retrieve the Infinity Stones from time to reverse Thanos' decimation. I admit, it was a good plot device, but I'm wondering why they didn't just go back to Wakanda in 2018 and stop Thanos right before he got the mind stone. Then again, Tony stated quantum physics time travel is different than regular time travel, which I can live with as long as no one confuses the two. (Like my little brother! Lol)The movie has a long runtime, which I felt Infinity War should've had that runtime. Because Infinity War had the heroes meeting new people, this has them revisiting spots in time for the audience Nostalgia. Again, I have no problem with this, but it could've been handled better. My only big problem with this film is Thor. No, I don't have a problem with his big beer belly. I have a problem with him joining the Guardians and declaring himself leader. I know it's played for laughs, but no one would like it if someone did that to them in real life at all. Star-lord is the leader Thor, bug off.
The finale of this movie was amazing to see in IMAX, although Tony's death had me crying. He at least died saving the whole universe from the Mad Titan. Which is the most noble death of all. At least also he got married to Pepper Potts. I wanted that ever since the first Iron Man film.
Thank you Stan Lee for creating these characters, and congratulations to anyone who's been with these movies since the beginning. We got to see this epic movie.",positive
Not enough time for all the characters. Should have been a two parter,positive
"I wish I can just easily say THE best movie ever and end there. But I need more letters here.Absolute perfection. I was so angry though with the Iron Man and Black Widow end but I am trying to make my peace with it. I somewhat get it.I have been obsessed with Tony Stark from 2008 . It has been a great ride.So with that said, Thank you to Mr Robert Downey Jr for what he brought to this character. I liked him since from Ally Mcbeal but this one, as Tony Stark; He made me a superhero movie fan.
And the Russo Brothers utmost perfect works ever. I really dont know how on earth they are going to top this.Loved every second of Iron Man and all that followed.Love this movie 3000💓💓💓",positive
"I read a review earlier and it was spot on to what I was thinking.First off, with the demise of Black Widow and the upcoming solo film. Who would even care to go see it?Secondly and most importantly. Knowing what we know about Captain America. Are we honestly to beleive that he went back in time and just lived out his life with Agent Carter? I am sure that would have been his preference but sincenhe knows of all the goings on that are about to occur and with his sense of duty, honor, and justice he just sits back and doesnt lend a hand?Wouldn't the events that unfolded in The Avengers adventures have changed since Cap would not habe been there to help?This is not a bad movie by any stretch but all the rave reviews are unwarranted.",positive
"This is probably my favorite marvel movie of all time. It's exciting, emotional, heartbreaking, and fun at the same time. It has everything a superhero movie should have. In the beginning of the movie, you really see the characters defeated, having lost to Thanos and half their friends and all life in the universe gone. But once Scott comes in and has a way to reverse the snap, they are all in, because they have a chance. A chance to undo their greatest failure and be redeemed as hero's, because they feel like they're barely keeping the world together with who they have left. And it's not just about being redeemed as hero's, it's about getting people that they love and care about back and are willing to do whatever it takes. With Scott's ability to access time travel, they go back to get the stones to reverse the snap. But there also really important moments in their. Like Thor talking with his mother and gaining his confidence back, because he felt like he was responsible for what Thanos did and failed to stop him, and not stopping him resulted in all those people got turned to ashes. Tony also has a heart-to-heart talk with the past version of his dad and realizes that his dad really did love him, to which he indirectly thanked him for it. And when Steve sees Peggy, he is reminded of the woman he loved and that he wanted to live a normal life with her before crashing into the ice. And Natasha, even after all the world has put her through, still sacrifices herself to get the soul stone. All of these moments are important in one way or another, and play a role at the end. Everyone that got dusted returns to fight Thanos in which I believe is the most epic scene in the MCU. During a final confrontation with Thanos, Tony steals the stones from him before he could do the snap again, sacrificing himself to defeat Thanos and his army. He was a billionaire playboy in the beginning of this film, but went out as universe saving hero. He was also the one who started the MCU and at his funeral it shows how many people have have come along for the journey that has led to this moment, and that Tony sacrificed himself so that everyone he cared about could go home to their loved ones and continue to live and be hero's. Also Steve after taking back the infinity stones, knowing Thanos has been defeated, decided to go back in time and live his life with Peggy, and passing on the mantle of Captain America to Sam.Overall this is a funny, emotional, and beautiful conclusion to the infinity saga.#RIP Natasha
#RIP Iron Man. I love you 3000

"20 movies raised up my expectation from marvel, but the endgame was just a photo album of many actors and actresses who played in a movie with too much dialogues, minimum action scenes, childish plot, flat jokes and predictable events. I had two reservations for this weekend and canceled the other one as soon as I came of theater.",negative
"This movie was very entertaining. I'm not even a huge MCU fan as I have not seen all of the movies.But, the movie still made a lot of sense having only seen those four movies. It was a nicely paced entertaining film. The acting was great and it was full of jokes and one liners. The trope of Thor becoming fat was a little out of place, but at the same time hilarious. Hulk was also very good in the movie, becoming this intellectual and kind of a gentle giant. When I saw this at the theaters, there were at least ten times the audience laughed out loud. The comedy is not only great, but the action sequence at the end is breath taking. The scene where everyone came out of the portals was amazing, and I even heard a few claps when it happened.The scene where Iron Man ____ was sad, but at the same time heartwarming in a way. His last scene was casual but extremely sad as everyone in the room knew he was dead. His send off was touching and gave me goosebumps to see everyone at his funeral. The final scene was one of the best I've seen in a long time. Captain America passing his shield on was amazing and him dancing with Peggy was just beautiful. I had a really fun time watching it and optimistic to see how Disney will handle the company in the upcoming years.",positive
"A MUST see in order to find out how the story that began 11 years ago finally ends.What I DIDN'T like:
1. Hulk not fighting for the second Avengers movie in a row. I thought for sure has was getting a rematch with Thanos, especially when he put on the infinity gauntlet (I thought the gamma radiation might amplify his power and turn him into super Hulk). Smart Hulk is boring.
2. Thor becoming a fat drunk. It totally detracts from his badass character and is insulting to his fans.
3. Captain Marvel (or her dumb haircut) only helping out for 5 seconds during the final battle... You know, since she's supposed to be the most powerful.
4. Too many characters sharing screen time during the final battle. Most only got about 10 seconds.What I DID like:
1. Iron Man going out in a blaze of glory with the same words that started it all.. ""I am Iron Man"".
2. Cap finally making a decision that didn't involve sacrifice by going back and living the life he missed out on.
3. Hawkeye going full ""Dark Passenger"".
4. Everything else.I remember reading these comic books as a teenager. Seeing all these characters (Iron Man in particular was always my favorite) come to life on the big screen has been some of the most exciting movie experiences of my life.",positive
"Omg, marvel smashed it with his one, such a great ending even tho I cried and hated it in my heart (lol), buf after a bit of time and understanding the impact it had. It was for the best. Hope to see the greatest character come back some day or get his own movie.",positive
"One of the best avengers movies ever, with Thanos and all this is what all the movies have been leading to and the finale is great! The visuals are on another level.
Some sad disappointing moments but that's how the story goes.
You need to watch this absolutely if you are a Marvel or superhero fan!",positive
"All I can say is that I've never been into the comics but this sets such a high bar maybe I missed out? I'm one who would rather watch the movie it's safe to say. Seriously this is the ultimate escapist celluloid brilliance I've witnessed in over 50-years of movies. This film is the masterpiece of the genre. What a cast too. I think after some settling I will actually feel inspired to go through the entire franchise again knowing this carrot is at the end. No criticism of any kind can I think of. Truly excellent to the point even if you're never seen anything Marvel you should step up and see Avenger's"" Endgame.",positive
"The second the iconic Marvel intro began, I was crying buckets. By far the best super hero film of all time. A complete finish to the most epic saga. Bring two buckets... one for your popcorn and one for your tears.",positive
"The Russo brothers manage to conclude this chapter of the MCU in a satisfying enough way by exploring the effects of a post snap world and allowing a sense of finality.The biggest thing against this movie is without a doubt its pacing. The first act overstays its welcome bogging down the beginning and leaving me feeling bored. The movie does however quicken up a bit which sadly gives way to minor story problems and a bit of an underwhelming conclusion.I also felt that some arcs and pay offs were not properly followed up on, leading to some grievances and frustrations in terms of characters and movie set ups, though it is understandable why they would sideline some of these characters.Endgame may not be infinity war in terms of quality but it achieves what it sets out to do albeit in some problematic aways.",positive
"Watching this was so surreal. It was unlike anything the MCU has ever seen, and I mean that in a good way. If there was an option to rate this higher I would",positive
"The movie is plagued by plot holes. I will not go over all of them but I spent over an hour after the movie listing all the plot holes to my daughter. The biggest and the most ridiculous one is that the Avengers had only enough Pym particles for one round trip each. Movie made a big deal about this. But towards the end, Thanos uses one vial of Pym particle on his ship with everyone on board. With thousands of minion creatures on it. With no special ""Quantum"" suit or equipment. You mean to tell me Avengers could've just got on a vehicle and teleport all together with one vial? And with Hank Pym back now, they can time travel at will from now on. Or go back in time to get more just like they did in the movie. This completely ruins the Marvel Universe.There also was a huge plot hole fail in The Last Jedi when Holdo sliced Snoke's mothership by going lightspeed. Which ruined the Star Wars Universe. And this rivals that plot hole. The Last Jedi was ruined by too many ridiculous plot holes.Their version of time travel is a big mess too. It says past and future is not connected and changing past doesn't effect future but there are parts where it shows the new past effecting the future. And they were making fun of Back to the Future.",positive
"Ok so first off the bat.. I'm not a big fan of superhero films.. I've enjoyed a few but I'm no fanboy.
Seeing men in tights with big letters on their chests just doesn't do it for me.
But I do like Batman Begins as an example of some guy in tights still been a good film.. I like gritty and a little dark my super heros.
I liked some of the X-Men franchise. (I,II, Future Past..) These were sometimes intelligent and interesting.
Sadly to me the whole Avengers franchise has felt like a dumbed down version of the X-Men films..
It's basically a lot of ego centric stereotypes wise cracking at each other and showing off..Sadly that's what I got from watching this.
The first hour was terrible.
Spoilers potentially!
It gets better in the second half for a while.
The actors show some emotion! Wow.. some years are shed. The wooden acting still shines through however..
I mean I'm surprised at the high ratings for this film.
It seems like everyone a just forgiven the huge plot holes, poor acting and unnatural script writing and ultra predictable stereotypes .. and everything that's bland and wrong with this film... Because...
It cost a boat load of money? Has a lot of secrecy around the ending(s)?
I actually stopped watching with about 30 mins left.. after the big battle where everyone is thrown together to fight off this guy who by that time we don't even care what happens to him anymore anyway.. it's all just a big mess if you ask me.
I really don't get it.
So many plot holes and WTF moments?
It's just all so wooden..
Like Guardians of the Galaxy but less funny, fun or relatable.
The CGI was disappointing. The hulk character had no life in him.. and neither did the actors sadly.
Half of the planets population is wiped out by badguy.
Avengers just sit around and wise crack at each other like it's just another day and another baddie to get.?!
It's just silly. So so silly.",negative
"I don't even think it's debatable to say Avengers Endgame is peak Marvel. It's a movie that keeps everyone on the edge of their seats throughout the entirety of it. The cinematography is beautiful, and there's lots of unexpected moments that push the movie farther and farther into its 3 hours. This is the perfect conclusion to the Infinity Saga, bringing together one of the best scenes in movie history at the end fight. Time travel is explored beautifully and in a new way. The Russo brothers topped themselves and the entirety of the MCU with Endgame. The theater experience was great, and so is each time I've watched it after. Robert Downey Jr. Delivered peak Iron Man, along with Chris Evans with Captain America, and Scarlett Johansson with Black Widow. The original 5 get new great moments, and the big 3 really get to nail in some legendary scenes. Anyone who watches this movie will be pleased and feel every bit of happy that they got this movie after years of MCU. It brings everything together in a crossover event that can't be matched. I hope to one day see something close to it again.",positive
"Review: Marvel Studios concludes their Infinity Saga on a shocking, exciting and satisfying note. This is the End of the Original Avengers and the Final Story for several characters such as Iron Man, Black Widow and Captain America.Takeaways:

"Undoubtedly this will not get published or heavily downvoted but in the interests of fairness here it is.A decent film, certainly not what was expected (the trailer is very, very misleading, which is a good thing in this case) however some characters were basically ruined for the sake of humour or that they couldn't be shoe-horned into the already overflowing roster, also there was in my opinion two kinda inescapably obvious flaws with the story which I won't spoil because honestly, I don't need to, I could hear the people sitting behind me and to my right say ""what? How?"" So I knew it wasn't just me overthinking it. The film is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not a ""10/10 omg I cried and laughed and what a masterpiece"" film that some of these reviews are saying it is.It's better than most MCU films, but it's no Winter Soldier or Iron Man by any means.",positive

"A love story to end all the 6 original heroes was an unexpected story telling brilliance. Cap wielding Mjölnir, awesome. Cap gotta live a full life with Peggy, awesome. Professor Hulk pretending to smash in NY, awesome. Fat Thor, awesome. Iron Man married with Pepper and a kid, awesome. Iron Man died saving everyone (asides from the rat and Ken Jeong who are the true heroes), awesome.I love the the whole MCU franchise, the characters, story telling and all, but I want to be honest about Endgame.Solely from a movie entertainment perspective, it's not entertaining like Infinity War, Civil War, Guardians Vol.1 & 2, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Ragnarok or even Avatar (since everyone is raving about beating that movie). I walked out feeling satisfied and grateful they did justice wrapping up all 6 characters honourably except Black Widow (she just like died there and that's that WHAT!), but also feeling extremely unsatisfied asking myself ""So, now what?"". The whole 3 hours are mostly about how to close the 6 heroes arc properly while peppering in killing Thanos and bringing the rest back.I know the studio made a call to give this Infinity Saga a respectful bowing out and curtains down moment by not having any future tease, but as a movie goer and MCU fan, I much prefer to know what I will get next instead of a that's it we're done moment. It's like they are telling me OK... now you can go chase other franchise cos Marvel is finished. We're done. Thanks for following us for 11 years and now you can go.Endgame left me with both emotions - happy they did justice to the story/heroes arc, disappointed they left me alone with nothing else to hope for next.",positive
"What is there to say about the ending to a film series that defined an entire new chapter of Hollywood? It's difficult to process everything that happens in Endgame, but that's to be expected from a film of this scale. It's enthralling and unforgettable - get ready to feel EVERY emotion!",positive

"This isn't a perfect movie, but it's closer to a 10 than a 9 for me, hence the rating. Also, I feel the need to offset reviews that are low for no reason other than the writer's lack of understanding of the Marvel universe.There's little worth saying to convince anyone to go see this movie - you can nitpick all you want, but you are guaranteed to be entertained. If you're remotely committed to the MCU, you simply can't miss out on its conclusion, which I found truly stellar. There's enough to love that everyone will have their own favorite 10-20 moments.I'm seeing a lot of hate surrounding three major plot elements: Captain Hammer, Chunky Thor, and Professor Hulk.Captain America wielding Mjolnir is well-established in Marvel comics, and was teased in Age of Ultron. They've been setting it up for years, and to be honest, seeing it in action has been one of my greatest wishlist items in the MCU. The hammer's inscription reads, ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor."" That's why Cap is suddenly imbued with the powers of the god of thunder. Surprised to see so many ""long-time fans"" in the reviews section here who felt this came out of left field.This version of Thor was a surprise, to be sure. After establishing his character as one who can suffer loss after loss (parents, love, home, brother) and still keep up the fight, seeing him go full Lebowski was a bit of a shocker. However, I don't feel it's unforgivable or unexplainable. He takes personal ownership for the loss to Thanos more heavily than any other Avenger, and it's quite an assertion to say that bearing the weight of the deaths of half the universe wouldn't break him. At worst, this was an unpopular character development choice. At best, it's an exploration of how an Asgardian's best can fall prey to the weakness of the humanness he's come to surround himself with.Professor Hulk...was probably my only gripe with the film. I've been itching to see Hulk at his fullest strength, and boy did that fall flat here. I was extremely happy to see Banner back in the green, but I've not personally read any of the comics where Banner and Hulk co-exist in this way, assuming such comics exist. Also - at no point in the movie did it seem like there was an advantage to this arrangement - they either needed Banner, or they needed Hulk - never did they need ""both"". Side note - I wanted desperately for uncontrolled, savage hulk to be unleashed when The Ancient One ejected Banner's astral form.",positive
"This story-arc wrap-up starts with half the Avengers and world in general dead and no way to fix it. Only of course they figure out a way, because that was telegraphed in the last movie, and some of that goes right and some horribly wrong leading to, yet again, a massive battle.The movie is generally speaking as entertaining as the last one, although it's attempt to use it's time-travel conceit to include every single character from every cinematic marvel universe movie ever made can be wearying, with characters I don't quite remember, characters appearing too briefly to make an impact, and a tremendous number of non-speaking cameos that serve no purpose except to let the audience say, ""oh yeah, them.""The first half is pretty zippy, with lots of banter and some flat-out slapstick. But the movie also wants to delve into the self-sacrifice theme, so the movie drifts into increasing levels of sorrow.The movie ends, obviously, with a vast battle, and while it's quite good, with some serious ""wow"" moments, it is the smaller, character-driven moments that truly stand out, like two superheroes battling each other to be the one to self-sacrifice. And while the post-battle weep-fest seems a bit long, the film does end with a particularly satisfying resolution to one superhero's arc.Endgame gives you the solid, expected Avengers experience. Comedic, dramatic, special-effects driven, and overlong. It's well worth seeing even though ultimately it's nothing you haven't seen before.",positive
I don't believe on the people that have given this 1 star because this is one of the best mcu movie and the greatest movie in the world. I was the most anticipated movie of 2019. It is one of the best movie in the world.,positive
"7 h ago I left zur cinema, but I m still left for words ... that movie totally flashed me even though I partly knew what would happen at the end (thats the problem With watching trailers so DON'T!)... I Think the last Time that happened to me was when I first saw LotR 3Even so the movie has its funny scenes it is much darker than most of the previous MCU movies...I really loved that beginning with hawkeye haveing a good time with his family but just seconds later he realized they are all gone cause of thanos snap...
So did the end...In a huge battle about Planet earth and the infinity glove You finally get to see that 1 out of 14 Million 6 hundred and 5 outcomes Dr. Strange saw... when the whole world and all ever seen MCU heroes fight thanos army (brought back by a snap of Hulk with time travelled Infinity gaunlet) Not Thor or Captain Marvel gets the final punch to end Thanos... it has to be the one all started with: IRON MAN ... just minutes after he holds Peter in his arms again he takes the Chance to sacrificed himself (he got a daughter with pepper now) and puts on the infinity gaunlet and snap away thanos and his army ... but also his Life (as the stones are to powerful) ... that was one hell of an emotional scene and that will be forever burnt in my mind
And there are others too that sacrificed their life: black widow gave her life to get hawkeye the soul stone (same as gamora did) and cap who is still alive but in his 80s now and took the chance to live his life with peggy while bringing back all infinity stones at the end of the movieEveryone knows that this is the best way to end avengers ... a heroic moment for Iron man the guy everything started with and changing his attitude in the best way ever possible...This is a 10/10 movie because it leaves u speechless...

"After a historically shocking setup, this beautifully imperfect movie really stuck the landing. It's an accomplishment many franchises just couldn't do (ie Game of Thrones, Star Wars sequel trilogy) but Marvel pulled it off, which just has to be recognized as special. Our OG Avengers end their stories here in a film that balanced fun, humor, and sheer emotion very well. I've never experienced such feelings or had such fun in a movie theater. It truly felt like I was living through history. My favorite Marvel film.",positive
"It's a fine action movie for one time, jokes are good too. However, it lacks something that Infinity War had. As anyone else I've been waiting for the greatest hit the entire year. It's sad to admit but I left the theater with a feeling of disatisfaction.",positive
"Wow... All i can say is that the movie ended my entire childhood in the most perfect way!!
It kept you on your feet the whole way through!! Marvel somehow manages to add comedy to the most intense situations. its Awesome!! The battle scene was out of this world!! I just... wow.. Thank you marvel. I love you 3000!!!

"The first half of the movie is incredibly boring, second half is awesome. No emotional attachment to the final scene, it dragged on way too long.Infinity war was way better in my opinion, better balance between action and slow scenes.",positive
"Captain America, Iron man and the Avengers all should have stopped after their first movie. Antman was terrible whatsoever and only Thor Ragnarok was a better movie than the first in the serie.
Endgame is a horrible movie and only rated high since it is the end of a well appreciated line.",negative
"Greetings again from the darkness. In what was originally titled ""Avengers: Infinity War Part 2"", we get the much-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3. Regardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this finale:Can the Avengers defeat Thanos?
What role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play?
Will those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life?
Will Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space?
Who will survive this final battle?We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, it's colossal/humongous/monumental ... whatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered quite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU entries).Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines, visually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I don't offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffic's classic ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread provided by 'Infinity War', we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than what we've come to expect.The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust me when I say, you've never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans' 10th film as Captain America, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It makes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.Since the previous and speculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that works, but that's the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at the expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.The theatre was packed with Dallas area critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few sniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional beginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters we've gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should know just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor ones. It's quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the Pepper Potts scenes.Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a 'women's movement' moment that seems to be Marvel's ""we hear you"" statement. Much of what we see is ""inevitable"", but as the Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when 'over-the-top' is 'just right'.",positive
"Not every highly-anticipated movie lives up to the expectations but Avengers: Endgame is one of those few that delivered almost everything that's been promised or to some extent, even more. Not only this is the perfect follow up to INFINITY WAR (2018) but a remarkably done, moving homage to a 10 year long successful franchise consisting 21 films!While the first hour & so skillfully sets up the high-stakes, gradually reveals the remaining avengers in an utterly emotionally wounded & frustrated post Infinity War world, the film cleverly picks up the momentum right after that with lots of twists & turns backed up by little & big moments of excitements as well as tears of joy & heart-pounding loss at the end.Kudos to the director-duo Russo brothers, the writers and everyone involved with this absolute epic conclusion of the saga that ultimately pulled off the most satisfying ending this whole story arc could have.Can't figure at the moment how they or anyone will be able to top this one in coming years.",positive
Good movie but a bit long especially during the 2nd phase (could skip 30min ez) and the end is not as epic as Infinity was last year...harcore fans will absolutly love it for sure for other it's just a good ending.,positive
"Everything that's happened over the past 11 years has been leading to this, and it's all put together beautifully. In my opinion, there are 3 movies to rewatch before watching Endgame: Iron Man 1, Winter Soldier, and Infinity War.",positive
Seems to be a lot of People expecting a No colour mute drama from the 20's. This move is simply amazing! 10/10 👏👏,positive
"OMG! ""Avengers: Endgame"" is absolutely Action Packed, Amazing, Epic, Brilliant, Masterpiece, and it's way more fun and better than Infinity War, like every Audience and I thought it would be. It had all the action, humor, and had very emotional scenes. The Russo Brothers, did way better than Joss Whedon. Why? Because, it's ""A must see"" and a perfect Marvel Studios film, for the whole entire audience to watch, but I Can't tell you what happens, or what happens in the end or who's coming back to life, because in the end of ""Avengers: Endgame"", no one, and I mean no one, or anyone, can guess what's gonna happen :) And Now it's shattering Box Office Records around the World! :) I loved it 3000 :) and it's far better than the first Avengers movie, and Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Avengers: Infinity War.Thank you, Marvel, Kevin Feige, The Russo Brothers, and most of all, Thank you, Stan Lee.",positive
"Thanos is way too strong without the infinity stones. Iron Man, Thor and Captain America together lose against him and not even Captain Marvel gets him (just after destroying a super-size starship with one blow). I just can't take this seriously - it doesn't fit into the Marvel-Universe.Furthermore, as a Thor fan I didn't like Captain America throwing around lightning with Mjolnir at all. Thor looked like a sidekick - what a shame. I would have expected a revive of Thor during the film and a demonstration of power towards the end. And Hulk, where was Hulk? No smashing of armies and no revenge against Thanos to make up for the last defeat.The expectations where just way too high...",positive
"Marvel Studios has been the largest producer of superhero movies for the last decade, achieving something never done before, creating a universe of connected movies and that these end up cohesive at a certain point. That point would be 'Avengers Endgame'.
The film is mainly about how the Avengers try to reverse the events of their predecessor 'Infinity War'.
It was to be expected that Marvel Studios was up to the task in this latest installment of its franchise and it certainly is, in part. The main achievement of the film lies in how it manages to unite all its plots and give a worthy closure to each character, but despite this, the film still has an unorganic script, something that was not the case in 'Infinity War'. This script is used as a mechanism to honor this universe and its fans, but in exchange it sacrifices a more coherent narrative.
It is for this reason that the greatest achievement of 'Endgame' falls on the construction of this universe, rather than on the film itself. A film that should be seen as a tribute to this path that has been traveled for more than ten years and that delivers a highly satisfying event not only for the characters, but also for the fans of the franchise.",positive
"Don't know what all the hype was about! The film is one hour too long because there just wasn't enough action. The Hulk was not so ""Incredible"" & Thor was not much of a ""God"" I was rather perplexed by how underutilised some of the characters were given the powers they have. The ending had potential, but unfortunately it failed to deliver. It's good but not great.",positive
"This movie was the biggest let down and anti climax of all time, I am one of the true marvel fans having grown up with the comics and watching all the big and small screen adaptations however this movie had the hype and potential to be the biggest greatest movie of all time , it wasn't it was rubbish !! And a joke , I felt so strongly about this i created this account just to write a review on this horrible movie . I won't spoil it but it was a rip off and a cheat infinity war was amazing 10/10 but endgame is 1/10 also just to rub salt into the wound there is no end credit cut scene so don't waste your time.... you are welcome,I can't believe the money this movie will make and it isn't even any good",negative
"One of the best movies I have ever watched ... ""Avengers : Endgame"" is the best Ending of 10 years of The MCU .. the movie was dramatic not just a superhero movie which the heros win at the end, No the movie has drama and the acting was too good from all the characters .. That's why I liked so much, It Isn't like any superhero film, It Was Epic !",positive
"I loved the movie and i only have two problems with it. They ""nerfed"" Thor way too much, I get it, he haven't been fighting for the last 5 years, but why didn't he fly up and destroy the Centauri ships of thanks ship when he's shooting at them. Captain marvel is strong.. we didn't need the ""strong female moment"" it REALLY ruined an otherwise good second meeting with captain marvel.. please just make it normal and not ""oh hey look, we're treating women with respect"" this is the opposite you're getting out of it..
this is the only problems I had with the movie otherwise amazing.. had to hold in a tear or two.",positive
"Yep, this surpassed ""The Dark Knight Rises"" for its length although I think the uncut version of ""Watchmen"" might be even longer. Everyone was hyped to see this movie particularly with how the Avengers would defeat Thanos. They do it in the first 20 minutes, rather easily. People were also wondering how Ant-Man would be freed from the quantum realm. That happens immediately afterwards, and it's done accidentally by a rat. And we still have two and a half hours left!The basic plot is that Ant-Man tells everyone that time moves differently in the quantum realm and they can use this knowledge to get the Infinity Stones from the past. Turns out they can't actually change the past, so it's safe for them to do whatever they want, as long as they find the Stones. The time travel bit comes in exactly an hour long. I looked at my watch! They get the Stones and have to deal with Thanos from the past coming which happens exactly at the two hour mark. Dang, this was wonderfully paced!I think this is the last Avengers movie, even though there will be more movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I saw this for my 30th birthday and knew I had to see something that special for it. My mom was crying when all the superheroes came back at the end. It's very difficult to keep up the interest in a movie for over three hours and you have to be a movie as awesome as this to do that! Time travel's always a lot of fun and we get great interactions from all the characters as normal. If only we had a scene after the credits! ****",positive
"A nice fun movie for comic lovers and families to watch. Entertaining. This film is really good but not great. It is much better than Infinity War and miles over that nonsense we saw called Age of Ultron. In spite of how good this film is, this really did not need to be 3 hours long. Maybe 2 hours 20 minutes, most of the beginning scenes were out of place and even some of the ending scenes. The action scenes were good quality, one of the best I've scene in a movie. The acting wasn't great, but good. Although this movie's storyline isn't The Dark Knight/Rises, Shawshank Redemption, or Empire Strikes Back quality, I am confused as to why the rating is a 9. The storyline is pretty average. Again, fun movie to watch, but not a movie I would watch more than twice. I've grown up a comic fan and have loved super heroes before they were considered cool, but don't expect this movie to meet beyond your expectations. It is all hype. That said I give this movie an 8 at the most.",positive
"This movie is honestly the Empire Strikes Back of Marvel. A lot of movies aren't nearly as good. Firstly, the CGI, the action, and just the special effects on the heroes, they're top notch. Second, I know that this movie doesn't exactly have the action throughout because of the time travel plot, well there's a quite a bit of action scenes, but it gives us a enjoyable throwback to the old MCU movies and saves the big blockbuster action for the finale and there's nothing to be said of the finale except for one word: EPIC. Lastly, it really put a good use of the 11 year buildup of our heroes. And you really careabout all of them. And everyone does career-best performances. But the star of the show is RDJ. He's always been great as Tony Stark, but I don't think he was as good as he was in this movie. He honestly deserves an Oscar. And don't listen to haters of this movie please. Just watch it and enjoy it.",positive
By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years,positive
"I was very excited to watch the grand finale of this 10 year journey but I must confess, I expected more... it's not terrible but it's average with individual funny moments...it didn't hit the mark for me.
The story starts well and builds up nicely when the team is reassembled, but I really didn't like their take on Thor Lebowski (looking like this insecure overweight guy) and The Hulk (who knows takes selfies and can talk about philosophy).
In my humble opinion it killed the essence of those characters, they could have linked the Hulk with the Maestro and Thor to have a moment of redemption coming back to his old self.
The final battle didn't feel organic like the one in infinity war, some unnecessary characters appeared and relevant ones like Dr Strange had little contribution.
I liked the ending for Steve Rogers and Iron Man",positive
"First of I only give it an 8 for what it is about and what it tries to do , a fun , enjoyable movie as all marvel films are . That said of course I disagree with it being a top 5 movie of all time , it doesn't even reach top 100 for me . But I always treated marvel movies in a different way because it would be unfair to compare it to far better films in many ways .
That out of the way , what I liked about Endgame is what I always liked about marvel movies , it is entertaining , the CGI is fantastic , the action is cool , the humor is good for the most part , last battle was great . So many things to like and enjoy about Endgame .
For the part that most people disagree about which is the first hour and a half . For me I liked what the Russo brothers tried to do , to humanize the characters and to show grief and how they are dealing with the aftermath , but for some reason it felt long and at the same time rushed ( I know it does not make sense ) like the whole Thor thing which was solved by beer ? it worked for Tony Stark and Captain America the best I guess , but stuff like the whole Hawkeye/Ronin thing was out of place , Rocket felt unnecessary in this movie , this whole Hulk thing I didn't get as well . So I appreciate the effort to make the characters more human but it did not work for all of them.
Now the deaths , I wasn't expecting Black Widow's death but I don't think I cared that much , for Iron man I know many people expected it , for me I didn't but I wasn't shocked , it was well done though and a great ending for his character.
So overall even with my complaints , it wasn't bad in any way , and you should watch it , I think .",positive
"I thought they did an okay job with the ending, but some parts didn't make sense or were missing. I believe everyone wanted to see Hulk fight Thanos again win or lose. Bruce was too wimpy to be the Hulk, really didn't have a purpose to be a big Bruce Hulk. Watching all the other marvel movies and building up the infinity stones , like they were untouchable by regular Earthlings. Now all a sudden anyone can touch an infinity stone without dying? In infinity war Thor's storm breaker was unstoppable, now all a sudden it's not as power but equal to everyone's else's weapons. Thought vision was coming back as grey vision. Thought good Loki would return. Thought the CGI looked really bad compared to all the other marvel movies? Seem like the marvel were getting better each year, and this one seems like it was the first CGI marvel movie. Captain America able to hold and pick up Thor s hammer? Really? I guess my biggest complain was Hulk, they already left him almost completely out of infinity war. The other was Capitan Marvel thinking she was the strongest, when I think it would be scarlet Witch, Thor , or Hulk, Dr Strange, then maybe captain marvel . This film felt like it was made in a hurry! Not bad movie, just not the best!",positive
"SO many reasons to love this movies but so many more to just completely hate it. I mean, how many times can you just do whatever you like in a movie and have to explain it in the movie that it is okay because of this reason. What a joke. Also, the movie felt like a mixture of ten percent of ten different movies mixed into one and was just not fun to try to follow. In fact, after the most boring first hour in moviedom history, the movie just started to do stuff that felt like it was filmed before the story was even written or a script in hand. And please dont get me started on the Hulk, I wont spoil anything but will say that it was not a pleasure watching him become the weakest Avenger. This movie should have been cut down to about two hours - it would have still blown chunks but at least it wouldnt have been a sleepy third hour. The movie makes me wish that movies offered satisfaction guarantees and returns. I wouldnt have returned any of the snacks but I would have asked for my ticket money back. It stank. And finally, the biggest let down was the acting - these people get paid loads of money and their acting is stilted and boring. Well, enough - I must be wrong as it is making so much money. Sorry, don't see it.",negative
"I kind of couldn't like it better than the infinity war at first but now that I keep finding myself going back to watch their time jump scenes and watching the final battle scenes over and over and over again, I realized something... infinity war started with a bang - Yes, Loki dies, Thor and Hulk we powerless but cut to Dr. Strange and Wong - casually going out to as happy friends before Hulk shows up - Cut to Tony - Strolling around with Pepper discussing the wedding, Peter Parker on a school bus with his friends - Scarlett and Vision enjoying freedom - You get the point - Infinity War was about the Avengers regrouping which is why the theme of the movie was bright and why we all loved it so much but Endgame was about reclaiming which is why, the dreaded dark theme in the movie makes us feel so bad - our favorite superheroes defeated and which is why, I find myself looking for scenes after they get back together in their final attempt to undo what has been done and despite what the haters say here, that final battle will remain the biggest moment in cinematic history!",positive
"Some ""fans"" saying, time travel is how u save it? Well what else? What do u expected? Use the stones to create new beings just as the ones they lost? Cmon wake up, it was totally expected the only thing everyone thought it was going to be made with the time stone, and not with the brilliant new quantum time travel, just genius. Yes Hulk didn't punch anything or anyone, but he is not the old Hulk guys keep up with the story, he was there to do banner job as a stronger being!
Thor is not a joke, he just showed his human side, living on Earth, after lost almost everyone we all put our sorrows on something he chose beer and food good for him i did too!!!The movie for me was better than I expected coz the way they time travel, i was like Wow!!!!",positive

"This movie marks the end of an era and it's one of those you remember forever, this was the first time
I've cried in the cinema and I got a lot of chills watching this, the movie is greatly done with amazing special effects. That ending is sad and beautiful at the same time, hands down the best Avengers movie!",positive
"I have no words for how bittersweet this movie was. I'm not in the habit of spoilers so have no fear this review has none of them. I can say you'll be amazing, you'll laugh and of course you'll cry..but for me I'm kinda upset in a way like a bittersweet chocolate bar I really like but kinda I hate I ate way..lol.
And I know these are fictional characters and I shouldn't be so invested but that's what Marvel and The Russo Brothers do..they have taken us on this journey with these characters and now it's like we're all hanging over this cliffside with them..not knowing where or how the journey will end knowing we probably won't looking away cause we love them. I just don't know if I can move on with the next phase.. theses dorks are my people and I think they outdone themselves this time.",positive
"In all honesty there is no recollection of any Marvel movie that can and did deliver on the full rollercoaster of emotions. I mean yes there is the strongest of possibilities you will cry in an Avengers movie.Endgame I'm sure you don't have to be told is set after Infinity War, infact five years after, we see how the surviving gang have been impacted by the loss of their friends from the actions of Thanos. From there they take us on a journey of how they can fix their wrong. You wont even recognise that three hours have passed as it keeps you fully engaged.Without giving too much away you will see how the next adventures may transpire and why there is a Guardians 3 coming. Really if you're a fan of the franchise you're going to see this anyway, so.......
There will be no spoilers here (#dontspoilendgame).",positive
"Actually, I can't understand why that many people enjoyed this movie so much. It's boring, illogical, predictable etc. Just an average movie about superheroes. The first part was much better in any aspect.Perhaps it's worth watching one time, but no more.",positive
This is the greatest MCU movie of mankind Captain america was awesome and made his character shine all you Back to the future Fans will love Hulks theory on time travel and the thanos ending fight is pure Cinematic excitement. this is probably the greatest no its the greatest movie i have seen in my 25 years living on this planet,positive
"I've never been a super fan of Superhero movies. Having said that have seen most of the marvel films. The one takeaway from Avengers Endgame is that it is an extremely ambitious piece of film making. It's unusual that so many of the actors and artists who many people have come to idolize over the years should come together in a film.The film starts five years after Infinity Wars ended. Not going to include any spoilers, but there's a good part of the opening half of the film spent looking into the devastating consequences of Infinity Wars which are very script/character driven. Not surprisingly the second half of the film is very much action based and the 3 hours running time fairly fizzes along. Although it isn't perfect Endgame is definitely one of the best Superhero movies I've watched and lived up to expectations.",positive
"Just overall badly written - down to the individual jokes not being funny, the side stories being uinteresting and the main plot also didn't work.Marvel apparently wants to reboot the MCU, by ""demoting"" or changing a lot of characters. None of the ""demotions"" were well done - instead of epic fights against Thanos resulting in the hero loosing his powers or getting injured, they more had them just slip our the back door. It is strange that you would miss an opportunity to have a batch of heroes killed in an epic battle, and instead srite them out the story with bad plotlines.The storyline was also a mess. The initial half hour or was it an hour before things got started could just have been cut down to five minutes, forgettable as it was. It was like the writers just gave up writing a meaningfull story from start to finish, and instead just had a main plotline patched together by coincidences (the bad guys randomly finding out what they heroes were doing), some side plots and then a big fight at the end.Even the selection of music was bad, there was hardly a scene with a really good song fitting a scene. This is something Marvel has been very good at, so it's strange they suddenly couldn't get that right.The point of the movie seems to reboot the MCU, removing a lot of characters because the actors playing them got too old for the roles - and maybe the writers had problems to create a story with a designated quota of heroes dying. I don't know what went wrong in the writing process, bur something for sure did.",negative
"I can honestly say that the obvious hype around this blockbuster was all worth it. Not only was this a commercial and pop culture success but it was one of the most technically and artistically accurate Marvel film I have ever seen. The myriad of characters, which individually are intelligently emphasized throughout the film without each one taking a better portion of the spotlight, was the strongest suit of the film. The visual effects were out of this world. The concept and the execution of the ""time heist idea"" was so innovatively surprising. I think it was impossible to talk about the film without the spoilers, and that's what made the movie so interesting to watch. Perfect movie for all Marvel fans like myself.",positive
"This was not the Grand Final i expected. It is just a Fan pleaser movie for the last Decade of MCU Films. I wanted to give it a seven, however I do understand why it was done this way, so it gets an eight. It was too much on feelings, to much slapstick ..anyway Homecoming is near to end phase 3 technically and I think it will be the better film overall.",positive
"Russo brothers did an outstanding job. Every moment of the movie was great. Some scenes that are connected to first Iron man movie, previous Avengers movies and comics were so neat that it just makes you say ""WOW!!!"". Battle scenes are breathtaking. Ending is just perfect. Enjoy the movie and make sure to watch it couple more times.",positive
"Movie is predictable and there is lots of story instead of fighting scenes. I like to roll of thor and hulk, they both were good. however, I feel that movie focus more on female which is really strange. I dont like the Doctor strange screen time it was hardly 1 minute (should be more)
overall for me infinity war wins the race but still it was great ride. Good Work and good ending. Could be better!",positive
"This is WAY better than Infinity War, my opinion though. But Thor-bawski was played for laughs too much.",positive
"This movie past over and beyond any expectation. Don't miss watching it..... will definitely watch it again and again. ""Endgame"" The name fits perfectly.
Total respect",positive
"For the most part, it succeeds, offering fans -- especially hard-core fans who've obsessed over the MCU films -- a satisfying conclusion. That it can serve so many different functions and work as an entertaining blockbuster in its own right is a testament to the vision of Marvel Studios and the skill of Endgame directors Anthony and Joe Russo.
But it's not perfect. And after a bit of reflection, you might scratch your head at the implications of some of Endgame's twists.Seriously, back away now.
Here are the biggest questions I have after Endgame:What's the deal with Hawkeye's new getup?
Let's start with an easy one before we really go down the rabbit hole.
Comics fans will recognize Clint Barton's switch from Hawkeye to Ronin, but the movie didn't fully explain the need for the new identity and costume. I get that losing your family is traumatic, but does it justify a hero costume makeover -- not to mention a full-sleeve tattoo? And where the heck did he get those new weapons and gear? He doesn't have the support of SHIELD anymore, so is he independently wealthy like Bruce Wayne?
It seems Hawkeye is a victim of the limited character development he's had in the past. Endgame makes it up to him, but there's a little too much at once.
At least he looks cool though.
What about those five years?
Early in Endgame the story jumps ahead five years, showing the survivors living with the fallout of what's been called ""The Decimation."" When the Avengers save the day, everyone returns to the present, five years after the crisis. It's a bold decision that ensures the MCU remains scarred by Thanos' infamous snap.
But the five-year gap leads to a lot of questions. What about the people who died in those five years? And as CNET editor Mike Sorrentino pointed out, what if someone moved on in life and remarried in that period? That would make for an awkward reunion.On top of that, can humanity even rebuild from becoming a postapocalyptic society? It's hard to see everyone going back to the way things were, though that seemed to be the implication when we saw Peter Parker returning to school.
Speaking of which...
How will Phase 4 address the time jump?
The trailers for Spider-Man: Far From Home -- the final movie in the MCU's Phase 3 -- hint at Peter Parker and friends on a fun international romp through Europe. Should we assume they were all affected by The Snap but are now continuing their education five years later like nothing happened? Has international tourism just picked up where it left off? How will Far From Home address the time jump?
The ramifications are even more serious with Black Panther, whose sequel will likely be part of Phase 4. Wakanda lost its king, and his sister, for five years. What happened? Did someone else take over? And does T'Challa automatically regain the throne after his return?
One of the final scenes had T'Challa overlooking his kingdom alongside Queen Ramanda and Shuri. But that glosses over some serious constitutional questions about how things operated while he was gone.
What about the history of the MCU?
Any time you employ time travel in a story, you're going to open cracks in logic. The Russo brothers admirably tried to button up the leaks by having Captain America return the stones to their various places in the timeline -- but that doesn't fix everything.For instance...
Are there two Captain Americas now?
We have the original Steve Rogers frozen in ice until he woke up in the 21st century MCU, as we saw in the movies. But now there's a second, older Steve Rogers hanging out in Peggy Carter's home in the intervening years. One theory is that Captain America was always going to go back in time and secretly reunite and marry Peggy.
There was a reference to Peggy getting married and having kids, but in a scene between Rogers and Carter in Captain America: Winter Soldier, there aren't any photos of her husband.
Still, it's a stretch to imagine Captain America staying hidden all that time -- especially knowing that Hydra had infiltrated Shield years earlier.Where the heck is Loki?
During the Back to the Future-style trip back to the events of the original Avengers movie, Scott Lang and Tony Stark's attempt to nab the Space Stone backfires, allowing the freshly apprehended Loki to nab the gem and disappear.
Ultimately, did Loki's escape change his fate at the hands of Thanos in Infinity War? It's plausible, given reports that Disney Plus is working on an original show based on the character.
But if that's true, then wouldn't it have affected the events of Thor: The Dark World, also revisited in Endgame? But during Thor's own time-jaunt we briefly see Loki in a cell, so the timeline wasn't altered.
How are Nebula and Gamora alive?
When Present Good Nebula shoots Past Evil Nebula, shouldn't Present Good Nebula cease to exist, like the photograph in Back to the Future? Alternatively, if it did happen to Past Evil Nebula, then Present Good Nebula should remember it, and in turn that memory would've been downloaded so Past Evil Nebula would see the hit coming
And don't get us started on how there's now an alternate version of Gamora.
Did Infinity War even happen?
Thanos and his crew jumped ahead from 2013 (during the original Guardians of the Galaxy) to the present, and are defeated. So past-Thanos couldn't have manipulated the events that led to Infinity War. If he never gathered the stones, Tony couldn't have undone the snap, which didn't even happen anyway.
And now my head hurts...
How did 2014 Thanos send his ship to the present?
There's a scene where Nebula hands over a vial of the Pym particles to Thanos, but the Avengers all seemed to need those snazzy white suits to travel through the Quantum Realm. Why is Thanos' ship different?
Also, if Nebula handed her one and only vial to Thanos, how did she get back? Or if she used that final vial, how did Thanos go forward in time?
Can the gauntlet revive Thanos?
Don't forget, the gauntlet is still around.
Did Captain America reconnect with the Red Skull?
Remember, Cap went back in time to return all of the Infinity Stones, right? If he returned the soul stone to Vormir, wouldn't he have run into the Red Skull? Granted, Red Skull was likely freed from his burden of watching over the stone, but it's not like he has a ship to take him off planet.
That would be a heck of an awkward reunion.
Would Tony Stark back his brain up?
He's done it in the comics. Or maybe I'm still in denial about losing Robert Downey Jr. Let's hope the Avengers don't pluck a teenage Tony from earlier in the timeline either... that's happened too.
Is Black Widow really dead?
This is one death that seems permanent, as it completes Natasha Romanov's arc as a loner spy who found a family worth sacrificing herself for. As she said in Avengers, ""I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out."" Consider it wiped.
But there's the persistent buzz that Black Widow will star in her own film. Sure, it could be a prequel, but this is a comic book universe, and deaths are all too easily reversed. In fact, of all the people left supposedly dead at the end of Endgame, three -- Black Widow, Loki and the Vision -- are all headlining future MCU movies and TV shows.
Where's Vision?
With WandaVision coming to the Disney Plus streaming service, there was a chance that Vision would return. But aside from a passing reference at the end by Wanda, Vision was nowhere to be found. The show could be a prequel to Infinity War, but in that movie Shuri was working on separating Vision from his Infinity Stone -- could he be resurrected without it?
Is Hulk's consciousness gone?
Bruce Banner and the Hulk have merged into ""Professor Hulk."" It seems Bruce is more in control, presumably submerging the Hulk personality we last saw in Thor: Ragnarok. How did that even happen? It's a pretty big deal to just explain away as happening offscreen.

"Pandering to the politics of the day created one shot during the epic battle of ALL of the female characters that this female found trite and patronizing. 2 or more other major plot decisions are also a betrayal of the fandom by surrendering to the tyranny of identity politics.
Uneven and contradictory handling of the characters and plot decisions created a long list of plot holes and distractions .... compare Spiderman's friend and Ant Man's daughter.
There are touching and heartfelt moments ... happy and sad tears shed. Sadly, those are diminished by the distractions of the plot issues.
The 7 rating was a nod to the efforts of the players, despite the machinations of the script.",positive
"Garbage.Only child and stupid people will like this movie.I wanted 3hours of action but instead I got 2 and a half hours of talking and 31 minutes of cool stuff.Moat boring movie of the 21st century,. The CGI characters look like they were animated with the gunk under people's toenails.I fell asleep halfway through and when I went home I just watched Howard the Duck on my phone,which is a much better movie you should watch instead.This film sucks and is an insult to ppl' intelligence.3/10",negative
This can only be described as perfect. What a ride and what a beautiful story. It's simply the most beautiful masterpiece in cinema history.,positive
When I saw Endgame and Carol came on screen with her new haircut the gay in me actually moaned in the theater so loud my mom sitting next to me had to tell me to call down,positive
"Endgame is an amazing culmination of 11 years of Marvel movies, leading to an epic battle. The acting, CGI, and plot are on point. It was also great to have references from previous movies, showing that all of the MCU is connected.I fully recommend, but do watch the previous movies to understand context, characters, and the story in general.",positive
"To make things simple, this movie is exactly what everyone wanted it to be, including myself of course. It's a great follow-up of the ""Infinity War"" which was simply astonishing and left room for sequel as it manages to maintain the pace, quality and excitement of its predecessor throughout its entire length of over three hours. It manages to be so dramatic, filled with action like every other installment but also very thrilling. You're always kept glued to the screen, waiting for the next thing to arrive with no room for boredom. The way it presents its ideas, its story but especially its action scenes is simply unique. As you can expect, all previous Marvel characters return to the scene with their great actors, which their job flawlessly regardless of the situation.It's one of those rare movie which keep me excited from the first trailer, which generates interest even when it isn't released, which makes me search for the best place in a cinema the moment it appears just to see it as soon as possible. The great part about it though is that it didn't disappoint in any way. Although pretty lengthy, it provided a satisfying watch with a good conclusion to the franchise. I couldn't find almost anything against it, thus the only thing I can do is to award it the maximum rating that it deserves.",positive
"The thirty second entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Endgame is a perfect conclusion to all the preceding films, aka the ""Infinity Saga,"" (even though there is one more film in the Infinity Saga). The cast really shines in this film, showing just how well they embody their characters. The deaths are emotional and amazingly done. Even Captain America, who doesn't die, has a beautiful finale to his story. Iron Mans sacrifice is done beautiful, and his message he recorded for Pepper and Morgan is tear-jerking. The death of Natasha is also done perfect to the last detail. All in all, this is a beautiful and poetic ending to many characters, while also allowing the continuation of this ever growing universe.",positive
"Spoilers ahead:I deducted two stars because of what they did with two characters:THOR: and not for the reason you think. I ENJOYED fat Thor THOROUGHLY. But for the life of me I can't digest the fact that Cap was able to work BOTH Mjolnir and Storm breaker AND better than Thor himself!!?. I would have preferred that Cap would work the Storm breaker but NOT Mjolnir. Because Mjolnir has the 'Worthy' tag attached to it. And if you see the scene where cap is fighting Thanos with both the Shield and Mjolnir, the sequence was DOPE but I think Thor deserved it much better. ALSO, the fact that Thanos just turned to dust was an injustice to Thor. I would have loved to see Thor finally GOING For the HEAD.HULK: The entire excitement around Hulk was built on why he could not get the Hulk when banner needed to. I was excited to watch how Hulk is revived back in Endgame. And his one on one with Thanos. NONE of it happened. He just appeared already as Dr Hulk Banner. And it absolutely sucked. He did nothing in the movie except something here n there. I was really disappointed. I would have loved to see him as banner up until the point where Ronan comes back from time travel and reports that Nat is gone and at the same time Thanos and his Army appears getting him SO angry he turns incontrollably to Hulk.
I think I should deduct more stars for that.But it still is a good movie leveraged by the fact that it was a mortal human who killed Thanos and not a god or a really really old man as cap.",positive
"When I walked out of the theatre I was really pleased with what I had seen( not a 10/10, but a good 9). But the more I thought about it the more weak points I could spot. There were some scenes that made me feel very angry, like all the stuff they have done to my favourite hero Thor. It was funny at first but later it just got on my nerves and made me (and all other fans of him) aggressive. There were also some scenes where the writers just found conclusion that were too easy compared to the problems that had been there. The movie also had some holes in its plot and things that just didn't seem very logic. But the start was great and all in all Marvel delivered very well. All in all it was a very good and enjoyable movie with some very emotional moments.",positive
"This is a kitchen sink movie, in that you get everything but the kitchen sink in it! The three hours flies by mostly due to the fact that the action rarely stops. It's a movie filled with laughs and tears and goodbyes. A couple of scenes seemed shoe horned in to appease the folks clamoring for more ""Woke"" moments. Those scenes aside, most of this epic movie is solidly put together and wonderfully presented. Without spoiling anything, I was scratching my head at some of the logic behind science in the movie that goes against every thing any movie viewer has ever seen, but I have a policy of throwing logic to the wind on super hero movies. What's the point when you have people flying and teleporting across space.
I've read this movie is a love letter to fans of the MCU. I'd agree with that, and would add that if it was a love letter, Robert Downey Jr. signature would be at the end, in the center, and slightly larger than anyone else.",positive
"I've been thinking. Isn't it fascinating how the geeks who are most devastated during a typical Marvel romp are often the same geeks who need to know everything about everything before the film in question comes out? The same people who wonder which of the superheroes erased in Avengers: Infinity War will return, and who will die for good in its sequel, are also well aware that actors like Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Holland still have pictures announced and that the contracts of Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. have at long last expired.Here's another hint: by the start of Avengers: Engame, a mostly thunderous follow-up to Infinity War that brings 20+ films and multiple series to a climax, only the original Avengers plus good old Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), are left to fight the mighty Thanos (Josh Brolin, as terrific as the CGI), now resting after snapping his Infinity Gauntlet and ""balancing the Universe"". If it wasn't obvious that Engame would be their swan song on some level, then I'm happy for ya.This means that Tony Stark/Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Evans), Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Dr. Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) are leading the charge, and they are rejoined by Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), another survivor from the original crew. Additionally, Scott ""Ant-Man"" Lang (Paul Rudd) emerges from the sub-atomic Quantum Realm, which holds the secret to how one defeats Thanos, even if he wields Dr. Strange's Time Stone. It doesn't involve any journeys up the mad titan's rectum, as the Internet has hoped.A pissed Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) and Thanos' cyborg daughter Nebula (Karen Gillan) are also with our heroes but trust me, no matter how long I go on, I won't do justice the brawl on which this movie ends or what a grand finale it is to everything we've seen since Iron Man. Is this too much info already? Does it kill the surprise twist that Endgame ends with a bunch of superheroes attacking the baddie?I won't explicitly spoil anything, but how does one watch this franchise religiously and still fear that the damage dealt by Thanos in Infinity War would last? Do none of you remember when Loki took over Asgard but it was fixed without hassle? Or the devastating fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. which was fixed in Ultron before much could happen? Indeed, throughout this titanic saga, there have been some brisk solutions to problems created by other filmmakers in previous chapters, and some of what the Russo brothers do in Endgame is no exception.However, there IS time for the aftermath of The Snap to sink in and the way the characters act is still completely consistent and understandable, given the events they've seen. People often cite Thor and how his eventual sense of humor (itself a coping mechanism) makes perfect sense, considering his time spent with jokester Tony Stark and company, and need I mention the evolution of Cap?Endgame does well with its characters in general, particularly at the start where everyone is at a low point following The Snap. I also find that I enjoy Captain Marvel a lot more when she is working off the others and, get this, actually has bit of an arc that involves learning about teamwork. There are some unexpected but welcome cameos as well, during the wonderfully trippy second act especially. So many memories.You can watch Endgame on its own and enjoy it (just brace for a few rushed effects and needless jokes), but even filler like Ant-Man 2 helps us understand where all these characters have ended up. Among MCU directors, the Russos seem to be the best at incorporating callbacks to previous Marvel films without making it distracting, or like said films are mandatory viewing. Having seen them all before the finale, however, is quite rewarding. They even fill in some blanks I didn't know we had.The MCU isn't perfect, especially after Captain Marvel and I guess Homecoming messed with the continuity somewhat, but the fact remains that few cinematic projects have been this meticulously planned and ambitious. As I am weary of superhero movies, I hope this is indeed an ending for the craze. And as such, it could have been far worse.I'm not saying it's the end. To be more realstically cynical, I have no misapprehension that Disney will abandon this money-well just because Endgame would make a good final movie. I'm sure they'll try to top it. After the Fox merger, they do have access to Galactus, Apocalypse and, worse yet, Deadpool.",positive
"Mild spoilers ahead:
This movie could lose some 60 minutes and nobody would notice (or probably will - it would be more fun). Some great acting wasted. Exponential comic absurdity mixed with cheap philosophy. SFX could be much better for such an epic attempt. Weepy ending with forced pathos ruins everything. I was truly glad when it finally was over. 3 stars for wrapping this up, hopefully for good.",negative
"Like every Marvel movies it has future'past experiences. Infinity war seemed more like a prequel.

"""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) is the final film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga, and it brings to a close the storylines of many of the franchise's most beloved characters. The film takes the audience on a journey through time and space, as the surviving Avengers attempt to restore order to the universe and defeat the evil Thanos.The themes of sacrifice, friendship, and the power of hope are at the forefront of the film, and the filmmakers handle these themes with the care and respect that the characters and their arcs deserve. The tone of the film is grandiose and epic, with moments of levity and humor to balance the film's more serious moments.The acting is, as always, superb, with standout performances from the entire cast. Robert Downey Jr. Brings a sense of closure to his decade-long portrayal of Tony Stark, while Chris Evans delivers a powerful farewell to his character Steve Rogers. The characters are well-developed and, for fans of the franchise, it is a treat to see so many of them on-screen together.The direction is top-notch, with the Russo brothers delivering some truly awe-inspiring action sequences that will have you on the edge of your seat. The score is fitting and emotive, adding to the film's overall sense of grandeur and importance. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the scope and scale of the film's epic battles and locations.The production design is outstanding, with each set piece and location looking like they have been lifted straight from the pages of a comic book.

It is a film that will leave audiences feeling satisfied and emotional, and it is a testament to the power of the superhero genre to tell compelling and emotionally resonant stories. This movie is exceptional and a truly unforgettable experience.",positive
"This movie was epic! I felt soooo many emotions and was so sad it ended. If they do other movies, idk how I will feel about someone else playing these characters.",positive
"It was really good, lived up to my expectations, and even though the whole time travel thing is unrealistic, I still liked how they did a look back at all the past films and then concluded it with a final fight. I liked how they ended the time travel journey with Romanoff's sad death. So, overall, didn't even feel like three hours. The only thing I would say to Captain America is that he could've given the shield to Barnes, because they've known each other for so long, but that's just how it is. But overall, it's definitely one of my favorite movies that I've seen.",positive
"I appreciated the movie greatly. They handled time travel in a very deft fashion, and tied it up nicely. I appreciate that they managed to maintain stakes for future installments.I have been a marvel fan since MY beginning. I read the comics as a kid, and made my own costumes. I latched onto the MCU from film 1 and have been there for every up and down of the franchise. I am proud of how they brought this era to a close.",positive
"For the disappointed fans, please bear in mind that it took 22 movies over 11years to make this happened. And you thought it was easy to suit everyone's liking? With some saying that the characters were ruined in this movie. It's 5 years later and you expected Thor to keep his shape. That's 5 years of guilt that he had to go through. Hulk didn't get even throw a punch in this movie? Come on, man. He had enough screen time to make his character shine. It's the story that builds up the action not action builds up the story. And that is 22 films into this major plot. Have we ever seen anything like this in movie history??? You should at least be thankful that this is happening in your lifetime. I'm giving a 8/10 for the movie and another +2 for everyone that made this happened over the the last 11years. Would you have better plan to make this movie in a period of 3hours? Then do it yourself!",positive
"The most anticipated film of the year: Reviewing ""Avengers: Endgame"" (NO SPOILERS)Saying this film gives fan service does not even begin to scratch the surface, as it is littered from beginning to end with quips. humor, forced appearances and minor characters. While being a send off to the old and an introduction to the new, this film was literally the end of the MCU as we know it, making me personally fear for the future of the franchise. It's not a bad film by any means, but it also fails to live up to the hype and emotion promised, although my screening was filled with thunderous applause, laughter, and literal sobbing at the end. Endgame is sort of a mess, and the story goes everywhere until finally reaching the climax. The film is split into three acts, all of which go entirely different directions, the first act is somber, yet humorous, for no reason at all. The second act is slightly confusing, but brilliant, bringing us back to different moments remembered throughout the MCU, and the third act is an all-out battle, not filmed particularly well. As far as films that wrap up a series go, with the 3-hour plus run-time, most of ""Endgame"" falls into the extremely average category, as more character growth should have been realized and the full potential of the original six Avengers, minus a couple, was never fully realized. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Jeremy Renner stand out in their respective roles, where Scarlett Johanson, Mark Ruffalo, and Chris Hemsworth feel greatly under utilized. The more modern Avengers cast is fresh, for the most part, but we begin to see where the MCU has over-saturated the franchise itself, as some characters that are even in briefly are far too invincible for a Universe based in modern times. The conclusion of the film will bring tears to some, but it's the closing the original MCU deserves after 11 long years. See it in the theater. ""Infinity War"" was the superior film. 7.5/10",positive
"I am totally blown away! The whole summer I sat and watched through the whole MCU and was so hyped for Endgame. It didn't disappoint. I love how great the balance between action and emotional character scenes was. And the character development! I don't understand why everyone criticize Hawkeyes development, cuz it was great. I love how he has gone from a totally boring action character in avengers 1 to a character you cared about. He made me cry so many times. That's a point too. I cried so much, and I have a hard time crying when I watch movies. And the time travel aspect that got so much critic. I love how they actually made a great thing about the quantum realm. When I watched Ant-man I thought about this, and finally! And the ending of Captain America... I have literally not cried so much in my whole life. What a great ending to one of the greatest humans of history! It's just one thing though, you have to be a marvel and watch the whole mcu before to understand. But I'm a marvel nerd, so I'm pleased! Go watch it right now, and prepare to become emotional and lose your whole supply off tears!",positive
"So I decided to watch Infinity War and End Game again, after previously being somewhat dissatisfied with End Game. Unfortunately my opinion did not change much.Infinity War was in my opinion a masterpiece. The characters, story and flow of it was perfect and did exactly what it needed to. End Game started off good but really fell short many times throughout. I thought back in 2019 that maybe I was being harsh, being that it was the end to the phase and It's always difficult to be objective, but I stand by it on my rewatch. Characters and story were fillers and did not serve enough to the story like it felt in IW. Final fight was not that satisfying and felt underwhelming. I did like Steve's ending though, even though many don't like time travel as a feature. Overall it was a good effort, many good moments throughout particularly the ones that coincided with Avengers 2012, but many moments did not serve well enough. CGI was perfect and the cast did their best often carrying the movie through its problems so props to them. I give it a generous 6 out of 10. This sits behind IW, Avengers 2012, and Civil War.",positive
"Couldn't believe how long this film was when I heard! 3 hours is just overwhelmingly bad if you ask me but still considering that I seen the previous 3 films I had to give this one a chance at least once.Went into this knowing the torture of watching a 3 hour film with an over stretched story line, plot holes galore, dragged scenes & political correctness shoved down your throat & that wasn't even the icing on the cake!But then after watching I found the film was below 3 hours. Actually, it was 2 hours & 49 minutes in total, but that's no far off the 3 hour mark. The film itself was ok & I mean below mediocre at best & at worst overrated!The story-line was easy enough to follow, but still had some confusing points which weren't well executed. Like the part where they traveled back in time & they were fighting their past selves. Other plot points too which didn't illustrate well what was happening or what was what.The run time which is obviously the biggest let down also contributed to the dragging nature which stretched out a story-line so simple it could've snapped! The ending especially was like watching paint dry in slow motion & my arse felt pretty numb when I left the cinema.There was some good action parts but there isn't much goes to say about this film or others like it which are clearly forgettable & loaded with confusing story-lines, details & sci-fi overkill.I also didn't appreciate the political correctness & female feminazi empowerment in this film which I seen twice at the finale part. A black woman at the end being ""king"" or ""leader"" of the land instead of Thor really? I don't know... I'd say that political correctness itself is just part of the issue I have with these films overall. It needs to stop!Overall not good & seriously over hyped for what it is! I can safely say these films have gone down hill since the beginning of the 2010's. They've delved into too much sci-fi, complicated story-lines with too much details, are too up in the air & not grounded enough & are riddled with political correctness! It's just sad as the classics before it were so much better & watchable, if not RE-watchable!The 10/10 reviews are clearly fake & once again proves just how biased the rating system has become with paid reviewers giving this junk anything over what I've rated it as. More honesty & less BS.2/10",negative
"After seeing Infinity War, I always wondered how our heroes would recover after the events of half the universe being wiped out. I was asking myself could this be the end? But then another hero emerged named Captain Marvel, and then I said to myself that this can give people hope. After the avengers grieve their loss to Thanos they were wondering what comes next now that half our friends are gone? And then Ant-Man came in and came up with a plan. The avengers finally put their differences aside and used the power of family, friendship, and teamwork to find each infinity stone from the past, present and future and used them to bring everyone back. Then Thanos from the past found out what they were doing and brought chaos once again upon the avengers. Then it was time for all heroes to reunite once again to finally put a stop to this. Also with the thanks to Tony Stark finally made the ultimate sacrifice to save humanity. This shows that he was ready to die no matter what down the road. There were other moments like Captain America finally being worthy to have the power of the gods, and many more! This truly was the end of an era to a great universe. I can't wait to see what the next phases along the way hold for us! Thank You Marvel! Thank you for this journey, it has been a wild ride!",positive
"Warning do not read unless seen film.It's was a long time coming but it was well worth the wait (for me anyway) and the film is somewhat an end of an era for the MCU. The film is fitting in many ways as this helps celebrate another grand anniversary for Marvel, the late great Stan Lee whom makes one final cameo here, but also the departure of most of the MCU alumni as it's their last film.This film is different, from the fact it's one of the longest comic book film yet almost the length of ""The Ten Commandments"", ok not really but clocked at three hours it's close. But the pacing was good I hardly noticed the time at all. But also just it's overall format as it's sort of like with the film ""A Better Tomorrow 2"" (I said sort of) It's all a big build up to lead you to a phenomenal payoff; and that's not a bad thing as it kept me enthralled and invested in the characters and what their doing. This film is dark as usual but has a mix of emotion which makes the film bittersweet at time, where there are some exciting and cheerful parts but then there are some tragic moments, one moment I won't say what put tears in my eyes along with most of the other audience, where I actually heard some crying behind me.The first half of the film it's sort of a character drama as we see each of the Avengers deal with aftermath blues. Five years have passed and we see just like the post-apocalyptic world their living in everyone is just broken, I'll admit it was pretty damn sad watching this, even the very beginning of the film was tragic, which I'll admit is something different for a comic book adaptation film where it would usually start of with wham bam action, this just isn't that time nor day for the Avengers.There are certain scenes of grimness like Scott Lang/Ant Man whom is visiting a memorial site which has lots of walls and names and he is making sure his daughter isn't on there, same with myself. Or even Natasha/Black Widow whom we see is the new head of S.H.E.L.D. (or should I say broken shield) as she's talking with the others you see her eating what looks like an unappetizing and not completely healthy sandwich. Things like that just show how time doesn't heal all wounds, it leave a scar; it makes sense the Avengers would all be in a bad states of mind because before Thanos they all had lives and people in them which gave them reasons to fight for, strip all that away and they have nothing their practically directionless and roleless. This goes to show how truly human the Avengers are, their all are living in crap county and can't find a way out; this just even more makes us want the Avengers to rise again not just to save the universe but to save their own souls.Each of the characters are good they all have their moments and hand in things, but also some good drama. I just state some of the ensemble.
Thanos (Josh Brolin): as usual is good, really like how he still a force to be reckoned with and isn't going to go easy on them anytime soon. There is one moment in the final battle that was so satisfying when he delivers a power punch to one character, I'm not a fan of, I won't say who, but I don't think I'm alone in saying it actually put a smile on my face.Ant Man/Scott Lang (Paul Rudd): he's his usual fun self but I really like how in some of the beginning and a bit of the rest of the film he's almost the main hero as he's the one that is not just offering a opportunity but also really helping bring the band back together.Thor (Chris Helmsworth): he's fun as usual, it's funny how he sorts of looks and is dressed like The Dude from ""The Big Lebowski"" but at the same time sad as it's shown how badly the aftermath blues have hit him. It sorts of your getting back in the saddle story where we see slowly but surely in the adventure, he's starting to become himself again.Clint/Hawkeye/Ronin (Jeremy Reiner): His character is tragic in this film; from the loss he's endeared he's became a shadow of himself. No longer an agent of Shield, he has become a Mercenary which we know in the comics as Ronin, where we see him not just use the bow but the katana which I thought was cool. Really like his back and forth with Natasha/Black Widow she's sort of like the sister he never had, she really helps in not just going on this quest but also toward self-forgiveness to reclaim his soul.Tony/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is also great, it's interesting seeing him settled down with his wife Pepper and have a daughter Morgan, which makes sense if you remember the Matt Fraction run. Despite slightly settled in his ways he doesn't feel he's finished, and he wants to give his family a better place to live in.The Third and final half is just a phenomenal payoff as it turns into a war movie where we see pretty much 20-30 minute all out war. I won't say most of what happens you must see it all for yourself. But I really like before the battle begins we see as Thanos is giving a bit of a speech, just the look on some of the Avengers emerging from the rubble and the look Steve, Thor, and Tony all have is just great as each of them are just beyond pissed like Jason Vorhees pissed, you just know Thanos is a dead man now. It was great seeing all three just giving all they had on Thanos, Cap with his regular Shield once more don't get me wrong liked the double shields he had but it just isn't quite the same, the circular vibranium shield is still my favorite. Iron Man as usual unleashing his arsenal. But best of all-seeing Thor kicking ass once more but we actually see him duel weld by using not just the Storm Breaker but the Valkyr which I though was a welcome return, as much as I like the axe hammer, I still prefer the first.However the biggest pay off is really what happens in the duration of the time when lets just say we all get the best Christmas present of all which of course lead to the biggest applause and cheering of all in fact two of them; it was such an exciting moment I don't see often. It was just the biggest love letter that spelled Marvel; but most importantly the film reminds us and makes us grateful of the importance of having heroes/superheroes around.Now I'm going to get real guys, for some of the Marvel movie alumni thanks and hopefully we'll see much more in the future. But as for the cast of the Avengers and the characters themselves, thanks for what you've done over the years, without you there wouldn't be an MCU or even a Marvel which is why it's sad to see you go, but you fought your final fight and now it's time to rest. And for Stan Lee I'll miss you, you were the Where's Waldo for the MCU film, but more than that a big influence and inspiration in my life, rest in peace man.Avengers Assemble.Rating: 4 stars",positive

"It was unexpected, infinity war was really different to this but I like this concept, since it has to do with time travel we get to adventure back in the MCU, infinity war was the big 10 year film and this was part 2, instead of being a giant action film there was also time traveling witch means we can go a trip down memory lane and see some of the past of the MCU, this makes for a great big movie that has had this much leading up to it. The climax was also really awesome, it was just the biggest fight ever! Generally a different movie than infinity war, but still solid.",positive

"I did enjoy the first half of the show. It was subtle and emotional. This was the first time ever in the franchise that they show us the capability of the actors they hired (except for Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland of course as they have been pretty much one-note. Well, it might be because of the script. They can still prove their ability in many other movies in the future).Then the action part came in. The central theme of the Avengers franchise. The time traveling was intriguing and everything, but seriously the end was a mess. That scene with force-feminism was ""cringy"" to its best. The death of the character(s) also felt forced and unnecessary.",positive
"First I would like to remark that it is my very own personal opinion and I don't want to scare anybody from watching this movie. Every MCU fan should watch this film, but as I, a comic fan as well, won't enjoy it as much as one expects it, in my opinion.
I grew up on these films and the crown of those films was unfortunately built merely on the last films for example Captain Marvel.
I don't want to speak about what would be better I better just say what I liked and what I did not.
I liked that the final battle was very comicish, and that this film explained a bunch of previous mysteries for instance how the Hydra got the scepter.
I disliked that the jokes were too childish for me and that the time travel was too sloppy.
I found a bit disrespectful what they did to Thor the god of thunder and I still don't understand why they boosted Captain America to be able to hold the Mjölnir and summon lightnings.
All in all I am a bit disappointed, I feel it is not worth my awaitings and I am a bit concerned what the future of our beloved characters will be.",positive
"Say goodbye to any semblance of a plot which is tied to character. This is not it. Bad writing and concept, probably born of corporate and committee-led ""creation teams"" has made these movies not into entertainment but just more fan service. When outrageous plot developments have no consequences because they can just be ""undone"" with time travel, the writers have no incentive to connect characters to decisions which permanently affect plot. The result is an empty but spectacular show full of glitter, movement, and noise. This is fine if that's what you wanted to see, but this is not a film about characters, despite its shallow attempts to bring it in for this or that moment (again, reversing all those character traits at a moments notice when it's convenient). It's disturbing to see fans rating this with 10's and ""best film ever"". One wonders if any kind of story is necessary at all to get the ""Wow"" reaction. Still, I applaud the filmmaker's efforts to add enough time to spotlight some of the characters, even if those efforts are in the end, transitory and a character mirage, to be forgotten, so that the big reset can take place. In this at least it is true to comics, and in that sense, this is a typical bit of bad comic plotting converted into film, so if praise is deserved for being true to mediocrity, at least they earned their 10/10 in that respect. Marvel movies are to film what Professional Wrestling is to the Olympics -- corrupt, shallow, and based on cheap thrills -- and worth watching only if that's what you came to see.",positive
I can't believe this movie has as high a rating as it does. This movie was so slow! It was more a drama then an action movie. You just had sad characters crying for the first two hours.And don't get me started on the time travel paradoxes. Time travel stories are for simpletons that can't write anything good.,negative
"This by far the best marvel movie I have ever watched, the emotions are strong, the battle was amazing, and when I watched it, i was shaking so much, and I couldn't breathe cuz of the fight scenes, and we lost some character's I won't say, but I cried!!, this movie is s must watch am telling you, it well be the best 3 hour and 2 mins of your life!",positive
"You think ""Infinity War"" was mind-blowing? So was I...but man...""Endgame"" is simply the best cinematic experience in my life and every fan since the beginning of the MCU can confirm it! I still got chills after this movie...it will haunt me for so long! You'll cheer, you'll laugh, you'll scream and also you'll cry...a lot.Watching this building of characters since 2008 on big screen and watching the culmination of it is hearthbreaking and emotional!Also...they kept the script very well. 3 hours long movie and I needed more at the end!Thank you Kevin Feige, Russo Brothers and all the cast members and people behind the scenses, who made this thing real. This is life event!I can't wait to watch it again and again and again with my friends...and yeah I'll cry just like the first time, but man...worthed!",positive

"I'll keep this short and spoiler free.Simply, it doesn't compare in story, performances, characters, structure, or even excitement to Infinity War. Infinity War far surpassed expectations on all fronts where unfortunately Endgame comes short.It's a fun movie and there's great and powerful moments. But ultimately there wasn't nearly enough suspense, and the plot was far too messy and borderline lazy.It was a good movie but I'm sad to say a disappointment in regards to what came before and in regards to the place it holds now in the history of the MCU.If you're just looking for a fun movie and are willing to ignore major plot holes, lazy story elements, and lacklustre character choices hopefully you can enjoy it for what it is. But it's no Infinity War; and although it has redeeming elements (which on their own could've been part of a great film) it's overall a disappointment. Lower your expectations. I hope you like it better than I did.",positive
I'm a dc fan but i love the hell out of it ! The movie was slow but wasn't boring at all and i enjoyed every second of it. One of the best in the MCU.,positive
"Not going to go into any spoilers I just felt that overall the movie was average, it did a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. The acting was decent, the action scenes were good if few and short and the pacing wasn't atrocious.But there were flaws, Brie Larson could have been replaced by a cardboard cut out, some of the twists made little sense and the big fight was rather unsatisfying and had a really cringy scene (you'll know it when you see it)Ultimately it's worth watching but the people rating this a 10 are overly hyped or wearing blinders because there were more than enough flaws evident throughout the movie. Basically go in expecting an alright action flick and you'll enjoy it.",positive
How did I not recognize Karen Gillan as nebula !! Funny at times otherwise kinda ridiculous,negative
"Honestly, this is probably the best superhero film I've ever seen in my life. Not only does this film deliver on spectacle, but it's very character driven as well, especially in the first act. Not many superhero films
can deal with grief and lost in such a great way, and then can make you laugh in the next scene without feeling jarring. I don't see how Marvel Studios can top this film.",positive
"After the decimation of half the universe at the hands of Thanos, the Avengers must fight to restore order to the universe once and for all in the conclusion to an 11-year, 22-film-long journey through the Marvel Cinematic Universe.If you've ever felt like all these shared universes and year-long franchises have been leading up to something, then, well, it's here. The moment fans have been waiting for since 2008 has finally arrived, culminating an already enormous franchise in a gigantic finale that's everything I wanted it to be and more. It's the most shocking and emotional movie out of the entire superhero genre, but also brings all the excitement and fun Marvel knows for while having a more somber tone than most Marvel films as well. This movie brings eleven years of cinema in a cinematic event that pays off every minute dedicated to waiting for, watching, and discussing Marvel films over the years. If you think you could get away with only watching a few of the previous films before this one, then you're wrong - in order to truly grasp the substance of Endgame like the movie wants you to, you are required to watch every film from the Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor trilogies to all the other connected adventures such as Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Captain Marvel, and of course, the first three Avengers film. After all, it has been an eleven-year adventure and, to be honest, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been the center of popular culture for as long as I've known about it and have been following it. In case you don't know, I've seen every Marvel movie in theaters since 2012 and this franchise has always had a special place in my heart. This movie is one that everyone can love, but simply going to see Endgame without any prior knowledge won't bring you as much joy and emotional payoff as that which so many fans in my theater, including myself, experienced when watching this film. The performances are all spectacular, including Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans reprising their beloved roles as the leading names of the Avengers, which have easily become the greatest characters in modern cinema. The movie does a wonderful job continuing every character arc from the previous films but still takes characters in unexpected directions, which may be why characters like Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Thor are such highlights as well. Every actor wonderfully reminds us why they were so perfect from the role, including the previously mentioned actors, as well as Mark Ruffalo who is always so enjoyable as Bruce Banner. Not to mention Paul Rudd, who is perfect comedic relief but also delivers a terrific performance overall as his character Scott Lang, better known as Ant-Man. Another character I was very impressed by is Nebula, who originates from the Guardians of the Galaxy films and is most deeply connected to Thanos from all the characters in the film. Nebula's arc has always intrigued me though many have overlooked it, and the script takes advantage of what makes her great very well and transforms her into a real hero, as opposed to her darker, villainous personality when her journey began in Guardians of the Galaxy. Telling you who else is in the film would already be a spoiler, but every cast member that does appear in the movie perfectly utilized and is very much welcomed every minute they're on screen.Remember when Avengers: Infinity War came out and everyone called it a cinematic landmark because of the incomparable scale and stakes? Well, Avengers: Endgame succeeds at topping that scale by creating something even more unimaginably enormous and climactic. Moments fans have awaited for years and buildup waiting to be payed off, it's all rewarded here in scenes you would never think to picture in your head but finally can. Audiences will continuously clap and cheer as the past films are referenced and heroes do awesome things you've always wanted them to do. This movie made me react like no movie before, and I had a huge smile on my face in some scenes that I just couldn't get rid of. Even after twenty-two films, Marvel takes unexpected directions that you wouldn't have thought of but still remain true to the long-lasting story arcs. This results in an emotionally surreal experience where you cannot tell what will happen next, or if Hollywood can ever top such a glorious event. The way Endgame handles its story serving as a climax of eleven years of cinema and as a 3-hour movie lover's dream, well, it convinces me that this is the peak of filmmaking history here. Every movie in history has always promised to ""up the ante"", but after Endgame, it's hard to see how the scale, stakes, and weight of this film can ever be topped. But that's not a bad thing. Maybe it just means that we lived in the right time, to witness such a grand phenomenon unfold in front of our eyes, and that we'll be able to tell those who come after us of the adventure we went on with these characters over the years, and the conclusion of their stories that we see here, wrapped up terrifically in one of the greatest superhero movie endings of all time, which in turn helps make up the greatest superhero movie, and one of the most astonishing action movies and blockbusters put to film in this day and age.Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic event that must be witnessed on the big screen, marking the end of an era for Marvel but one that still exceeds expectations with fantastic writing, emotional value, nostalgia, and visuals and set pieces that will be remembered for the rest of however long superhero and action movies continue to be made. Thank you, Marvel Studios, for making such a sensational universe and making the experience of being a fan an unforgettable one. I'm sure more people can agree with me on that than Thanos can snap away. You've definitely already heard of Avengers: Endgame and now that you know why you should see it, what are you waiting for? 10/10",positive

"There have been few Marvel movies that I vaguely liked, and over the years, I've fallen asleep through many. I straight up didn't understand some of them, and none of them did I genuinely enjoy the whole way through.Except this one. This one is different. It is the only one that made me care about anything that was happening. Spending a lot of time on story/emotional development in the first hour made me care about what happened the last two. And it flew by, didn't even notice. I cried, laughed and actually cheered/rooted during the last fight scene.Best one of the bunch for me. Glad it could wrap up on a high note.",positive

"Captain McFly and Doc Emmett Bannner travel back in time to undo history but unfortunately Thanos Tannen finds out about the time travel shenanigans and manages to use time travel himself to his advantage.I'm a massive fan of time travel movies but this just seems to be a tacked on plot device to suck more dough from the fans.Lots of explosions and CGI. Pretty to watch, but that was about it.Should've ended with Infinity War.",positive
"Several of the narrative problems that are present in Infinity War are not resolved or made worse by this remarkably lazy film. Of note, Thanos' ideology is both utterly incoherent and utterly alien to the Zeitgeist. The writers simply lacked the courage to make Thanos into the eugenicist that he so clearly should be. Without that edge to him he is a scene chewing comic book *villain* in the worse way. I simply did not care about the plot because the villain is a snidely whiplash joke. The film doubles down on the idiocy present in Infinity War as Thanos' end goal is just more so. This problem renders the film hollow, emotionally inert.That might have been overlooked if the film's overall structure wasn't, more or less, identical to Infinity War. Starting at about 30 minutes in the two films run remarkably in parallel with each other. The pieces are slightly jumbled and certain characters end up playing different beats but act to act, sequence to sequence, scene to scene the underlying scaffolding of the plot is the same. This would be better if the plotting wasn't redundant in the first place. Infinity War boiled down to 6 color coded chase scenes over MacGruffins. The same is true in Endgame but even more so. The plot device introduced to allow the team a fighting chance produces whole manners of plot contrivances, incoherence and murky what the heck is happening. There are 21 other films in the series and while I have seen every single one (some more than 3 times!) I simply don't have the convoluted metaphysics memorized. If you saw each film once in the theatre as they were released parts of this mess will confuse you.On that note the Infinity Stones are even more MacGruffins in this film as Endgame doesn't even bother to try to visualize their various powers. Infinity War turned magick users into mere boxers and this film continues to lower the bar for imaginative use of space magick. I still don't understand what the difference between, say, the space stone and reality stone is practically. There is nothing in the film that demonstrates their powers. This adds to the rote laziness that the film embodies.Inevitably in a film like this a few characters will get short changed. This happened here to my favorite character. For a film that so copied its predecessor's structure I am gobsmacked that not all re-matches occurred in the action scenes. Some of them do, but a pretty obvious and possibly entertaining one doesn't. On top of that the final moment-key to a character and the plot- is overly telegraphed due to the extraordinary amount of time spent with said character and the seeming checklist they have for a farewell tour. The balance is wrong for the character relationships. You can more or less guess the consequences based on screen time.None of the consequences of the two films seem final, abet textually a few of them are (I guess). Capital being what it is Disney would never kill off a bunch of Golden Geese; it was always faintly absurd the two films pretended otherwise. This narrative holdover from Infinity War takes a lot of heat out of the film.There are a few nice quips. There are also some promising team up moments in the film that point to brighter days. But in the end this is navel gazing nonsense.",negative
"Where to begin. This movie was everything I wanted and more. It was unpredictable, kept me guessing and was full of action and character driven moments. The story was the perfect conclusion to the characters we know and love and the epic storyline built over eleven years. There was only small nitpick I had about the movie, but to reveal it would spoil the experience that is Avengers: Endgame. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evens, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner all give 110%, as does the supporting cast. The way this film wrappes up the journies of the characters we've known for so long is beautiful. All of the characters could not have had better endings. The film is heartbreaking, exciting and well written. It's deserves all the praise it's getting. See this film, now! Before someone spoils it and because it needs to be seen on the big screen. Trust me, the climax is one of the biggest and most exciting climaxes put to film. This is the best film in the MCU, the best film of 2019 so far and will most likely continue being so and it is one of my personal favourite movies, I enjoyed it that much. 10/10. Book tickets as soon as you've finished reading this. It'll be the most exciting 3 hours of your life.",positive
"The movie had everything . It was worth the wait. I laughed and cried at the end. It was the most perfect conclusion. I'm going to miss Tony , it was the perfect ending for him.",positive
"Trust me, I wanted to be one of the hardcore marvel fans who praised this movie as the best comic book movie of all time but in fact it's almost the complete opposite. (""Sigh""). 11 years and 22 movies has led up to this moment. As I type this review I have Ironman on in the background and I remember how this was the movie to kick this whole thing into action. Ironman will be one of those movies that can be on any cable network from years to come and still be worth while to watch. Avengers: Endgame was basically a Tony Stark/Ironman swan song/tribute movie. I think most of us expected Tony Stark to go out somehow but that isn't what Endgames problem was.Endgame felt like it actually was too much of a movie and with that you get tons of plot holes and unanswered questions. In my honest opinion I was far more blown away from watching Infinity War vs Endgame. I am very disappointed in how they used Bruce Banner and Hulk. It was a Green Bruce Banner and Hulk didn't get any due justice or revenge on Thanos. Also, how is he still alive? Isn't Bruce a mortal being? How could he possess the power of all the stones and survive? I hated how they just ignored Steve returning the infinity stones and leaving so many questions. Like what about the Red Skull? Captain America vs Red skull round 2? What about Black Widow? Is she in the soul world? Why wasn't she resurrected once the soul stone was returned? Why didn't the ancient one see this coming if she was the guardian of the time stone before Dr. Strange? Highlights of the movie was definitely cap being worthy of Mjolnir. Thor Lebowski was very funny and entertaining. For those reading this review, just think a rat was responsible for all of this.Overall, Endgame could have been 4 hours long and I'd still sit through it. I just wish marvel and the Russo's wouldn't have made infinity war and endgame back to back. Endgame should have been more carefully thought out. Looking forward to Asguardians of the Galaxy next. Oh one more, don't do a black widow prequel, address the confusion with her being trapped in the Soul World.",positive
"So here we have it, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, the expansive sequel to not only AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR but also to the whole last 13 years or so of Marvel cinema. It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.The time travel plot might seem a cop out to some, but I really enjoyed the way it gives characters a chance to revisit earlier productions (and even allow the likes of Robert Redford to show up in clever cameos). The climactic action is well worth the wait and bests the battles in LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING in terms of pure CGI spectacle; it only took them 16 years to get it right. Great fun, anyway, and one for the ages.",positive
"When they started the MCU 11 years ago, I was pretty skeptical and thought that it wouldn't last. I was wrong. I was very wrong back then. Making 22 movies in 11 years and sharing one universe is one thing, but the ending to that era is another. Growing up with MCU changes me on how I see the sharing universe works on real life. The way they ended a saga is pretty darn good. Everything about this movie is pure excitement and you will be wanting more even after 22 movies. That three hours felt like hour and half for me. This movie made me realised that the movie industry are keep getting better through the years. Perfect ending for The Infinity Saga!",positive
"Just wanna say me and my son watch this movie time and time again. Paul Rudd as ant man , and Chris the surfer as Thor , and everyone else even black widow and the cameos have made this movie a family favorite and all the other avengers and super hero teams too. Keep on keeping on and Shaka brahs..... surfs up somewhere :)",positive
"Disney knew it was going to make a ton of money from this sequel and so it feels like everyone involved in its production, from directors, writers and actors etc. just didn't bother turning up - aside from collecting their pay cheque. Anyone with a reasonable amount of intelligence and maturity will know the movie undelivered massively. Perhaps trying to weave characters in and out of previous movies took their eye off the quality of the offering. For those who have rated it a 10, once their excitement from all the anticipation dwindles, reality will sobering. Shame all the previous quality, especially infinity, has this movie associated. I should've known something was amiss when cpt marvel turned out to ba a total waste of time. MCU Phase 4...? You can shove that up your....!",positive
You didn't saw that coming. If you don't leave the theater crying there is something really wrong with you,positive
"First off, 'Endgame' is definitely worth watching. It is hard to overestimate the cinematic achievements demonstrated in the movie. It pays tribute to all the plotlines that had been leading up to this culmination through the years. There are some exceptional and iconic scenes which will surely command admiration of many Marvel fans to come.There are moments to rejoice, there are moments to cry, there are moments to laugh, there are moments to appreciate the fact that you are a contemporary of the people involved in bringing this whole universe to life and that you can experience all this first-hand.Judging the film by its own merits, however, is a different story. It felt like the directors wanted to seize this 'last' chance and do homage to so many characters and so many things that in the end we are left with this motley crew of multiple episodes and actions stuffed in one wannabe epic finale.With all its charge and glory, 'Avengers: Endgame' does not surpass 'Infinity War'. After that masterful fight on Titan, turning a black hole into butterflies bears no comparison to taming... a river.",positive
"I didn't think this was politically correct enough. Captain Marvel is my favourite MCU character and It caused me great pain when the lovely Captain Marvel was brutally punched by the savage beast known as Thanos. I was overwhelmed with a great urge to help her like a heroic chivalrous knight but unfortunately as I sat there watching it on the screen in the cinema and knowing it wasn't exactly real, I knew I couldn't do anything about it and the second I realised that I burst into tears crying. If only I had the power to transport myself to fictional films I would've helped her out. I also thought the effects were terrible for a film with a $250 million plus budget and I felt Thor's alcoholism was inappropriate for a film that's watched by many children.",negative
This movie is super emotional specially for marvel fans like myself . I loved it and it was the ultimate experience one can get . I love it 3000.,positive
"The premise of the quantum realm and time travel in MCU is, when you change the past, you're not changing the future. You made alternate realities. Like how nebula is killing her past self yet she didn't die with her. And how Thanos came to the future and lost means there's a reality where he never got any Infinity stones, coz if it's the same reality, Guardians of Galaxy wouldn't even be assemble.Now, how could Rogers change his past yet he could still be in the ""normal"" reality?",positive
"Strongly believe that infinity war was a way more superior movie, with way more memorable scenes and a buildup to an impactful ending. While endgame incorporates all the characters in the story, it makes me feel less emotion for any of them. It was not a waste of money, no doubt, but it felt like the movie was being carried by audience feels for individual characters more than an exciting plot.",positive
"This movie was focusing a lot on the characters and their way to cope with what happened in ""Avengers: Infinity War"". I really loved what they did with Tony, Nat and Steve. The performances, especially Robert Downey Jr., are brilliant and some of the best Marvel has to offer. The story was really smart and unexpected, in a way. The path they chose to take with Thanos, was really interesting and exciting. Watching them re-live previous MCU movies, was just so awesome. The final act of the movie is one of the best things i have ever had the pleasure to see. Every character got their moments to shine, which will be considered as iconic and legendary. Iron Man's death was handled to perfection and I love that scene so much. They made us say goodbye to a lot of our favorite characters, but they managed to make us happy. Overall, this is the second best MCU movie ever.",positive
"Review:
After watching Infinity War in the cinema, I was pumped to see Endgame, so I avoided the rumours, even though I knew that the Ant-man's ""so-called"" time machine would play a big part in the final showdown, and I rushed to the cinema when it was released. I must admit, I did fall asleep through the whole beginning of Endgame because I found it boring, and the constant chatting got on my nerves, so I wasn't really interested in the ending. Now that I have watched it in the comfort of my own home, in other words, I can pause and rewind it when I want, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The beginning was basically the build-up to an epic ending, which was put together extremely well. I couldn't work out how they were going to cover so much ground, especially as there was a lot of characters with there own personal reasons to take down Thanos, but now that I have watched the whole film through properly, I can totally understand why the writers and directors made this 3hr extravaganza the way that they did. There were some sketchy parts in the storyline, like what actually happened to Gomorrah, were the hell was Nick Fury and why didn't they revive Vision, but the epic action scenes towards the end made up for it. The cleverly written script brought humour and intensity to an, somewhat, impossible situation, and the various twists made it a joy to watch. It didn't actually seem like it was 3hours long, which is a good thing, and it was brilliant to see all of the superheroes battling together to the very end. The visual effects were second to none, and the sad ending was unpredictable, but I hope that we will get to see some of the MCU again soon. I know that the die-hard fans were questioning the ending, especially when Captain America gave Falcon the shield, but we are yet to see the true meaning of that decision. Anyway, it's definitely a film that you can watch time and time again, especially back to back with Infinity War, so it has to get the thumbs up from me. Brilliant!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, who also brought you Pieces in 1997, Welcome to Collinwood, starring George Clooney and Sam Rockwell, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. As one of the most expensive movies ever made, with the largest Marvel marketing campaign, Disney knew that they had something special, but I doubt that they ever anticipated it's success. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. It grossed nearly $2.8 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity War's entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. As they filmed the last 2 movies back to back, I can't see another movie of this magnitude ever being made again, especially with so many A-list stars. In Phase Four we will be seeing the Black Widow in May 2020, the Falcon and the Winter Soldier coming in August 2020, a Loki movie in Spring 2021, Spider-Man 3 in Summer 2021, Hawkeye 2021 and Thor: Love & Thunder coming in the fall of 2021. In Phase Five, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Captain Marvel and Blade will be returning to the big screen, so there is a lot to look forward to. DC better pull there finger out!Budget: $356million

"... well I missed something and... didn't like everything.This movie is great. It is a wonderful conclusion and causes lots of emotions.

But, hey, that's ok after all.But... it once said that no one can stand to handle or even hold a single Infinity Stone, but well, everybody does it in this film o.0Well, those are the flaws for me - anything else is nearly perfect. Maybe besides some... logical issues that always come along with that time travel thing.I was deeply impressed by the CGI, though I normally prefer practical effects. Thanos looked way better than in Infinity.And... I... ok I loved the scene, but... how could Tony even try for a second to use all stones...? Well, it doesn't matter - it was HIS moment. It has been the best way to good bye. What a heroic scene.",positive
"I would be lying if I said that I wasn't a little disappointed. The Avengers: Endgame has been one of the most anticipated movies since... well since The Force Awakens but that was way back in 2015 and in this day and age that's like a million years ago. The point being: Endgame was the talk of the town since all of those beloved MCU characters faded away. Infinity War was such an epic movie what could Marvel do as an encore? Or better still, what could Marvel do to conclude the magnificent journey they took us on?If anything, Endgame proves that it's hard to write a perfect ending. Perfect endings are stuff of legend. Whether the ending has a twist, a ride off into the sunset, or a mixed bag they are hard to write and hard to execute. Endgame is supposed to be just as the title suggests: the end. This is where the Avengers wrap it all up. Endgame was one long goodbye and it seems they tried to make it as heartfelt and dramatic as possible.Infinity War started with a bang and ended with a bang. It was a fast moving roller coaster throughout. It came together so nicely with all the different characters, the different tasks, and the different battles. It was a superb blend of flavors that came together for an excellent meal. Endgame, on the other hand, was almost like a decompression. If you were huffing and puffing from Infinity War then Endgame was a chance for you to rest, catch your breath, and absorb all of what happened. It was a long slow exhale with just one last burst of energy before retiring. And it wasn't what I was expecting.Not that getting what one expects is necessary to be considered good because sometimes you can be surprised in the best way. After all, we've trusted Marvel thus far so no reason not to trust them to put the finishing touches on their masterpiece. Now that I've seen their final brush strokes and the completed work I have to say that their hand slipped a little when adding the finishing touches.Like a fireworks show or a symphony I wanted the ending to be this huge crescendo. I'm not talking simply about the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, but the entire movie. I wanted to see all of the fine Marvel characters in their finest form, or close to it, as they went for their last hurrah. I wanted them all to be like John Elway retiring after his second Super Bowl, retiring on top, not Muhammad Ali who held on too long and had a less than flattering exit from boxing. But that's not what I got.We got to see heroics, of course it's a superhero film, but it was so subdued. The entire tone of the movie was muted. It was a somber morose three hours. The humor wasn't as humorous. The fighting was somehow less awesome. Everything was just darker and more lifeless. Even the hero moments which were supposed to evoke the most joy, awe, and righteous triumph didn't quite do it. Now it could be because it was 12 a.m. by the time the movie wrapped up and I was tired but I don't think that was it. Many a movie has revived me due to it's captivation. End Game didn't revive me or stir me in the way I thought it should. If anything, they put me to rest along with the Avengers saga. I was going for a conclusion, yes, but I also wanted reinvigoration and revival. Sadly, I got solemn and subdue",positive
"I can't believe it, why are people is giving this a 1/10 it's a Masterpiece and original people theses days just don't have good taste on movies they just go like other overrated movies the ending is so amazing",positive
"Overall this was a good movie. Character screen time was definitely not split as well as the last outing. Just seemed like a long build up for a poorly lit end battle. Again, a good show but not up to the standard that I have grown to expect for Marvel.",positive
"This was a fair conclusion of the MCU but disappointing to see so many headline character's have their story arcs brought to an end. Thanos started well in Infitiy War but just felt like a generic super-villain here. The big battle at the end was fine, but the CGI was a little too much.",negative
"To be fair there has been a lot of build up story and character development movies to this, but what a payoff. Will there ever be such reward for the audience that has followed the journey? I find it hard to believe. If there ever is I hope to experience it in my lifetime.With Infinity War to complement this main story-line, the audience is given an absolute treat. I am grateful to have followed this journey since 2008 and avoided all spoilers. Put simply, in my opinion, if you have seen all the preceding MCU movies, Infinity War and Endgame are the best action/superhero movies ever.",positive
"After Infinity War I was waiting for marvelous final in End Game, but Marvel surprised me in negative way. They finished one the greatest franchise ever as drama and tragedy. They added so many dialogues that some people has been falling asleep.
After dynamical Infinity War they gave us a so slow motion film. And finally, that what they did with Captain America it's a disaster for time theory!",positive
Just go watch it I promise you won't regret itP.S. don't wait for the after credits scene there are none,positive
"I gave this movie a 1/10... watch IMDB change it to a 10
Pay to play. Welcome to the real world.",positive
"What surprised me most about the movie is how funny it was. There were any number of hilarious moments that countered the profoundly sad moments. Rocket scammering away from chasing Asgardian soldiers, Stark and Nebula playing paper football, Thor playing video games and threatening a child player and on and on. Hilarious.I was concerned about how they would handle Captain Marvel because she is very powerful. I was really happy with her scenes as well as the one in which the Scarlett Witch showed up in super pissed off mode. I also stood up and cheered when Captain America wielded Mjolnir. The scene where EVERYBODY showed up via mystic portals was uber nerd paradise.I was a bit underwhelmed with how they handled Thor early on in the movie. While it was very funny, it was disappointing to see that he had let himself fall apart in an alcoholic stupor. I feel that his obligation to Odin to take care of people would have forced him to devote himself to that responsibility.Now for the deaths...first off, when I saw Black Widow and Hawkeye heading off to get the soulstone, I figured that was the end of Hawkeye. I never saw Black Widow dying as an even remote possibility but it does make a bit of sense. I was still sad to see her go.In retrospect, Tony Stark's sacrifice was foreshadowed heavilly in the scene where he cracked the time travel problem. He told Pepper that he could just throw it all away and live his life. He had to be true to his character's own purpose and be the hero. When he was dying, you could hear several people crying....loudly.We are going to see it again tomorrow. Well done Marvel. You really went for the head with great success.",positive
"I can't review it, cannot be described with words, experience it yourself on theatre guys! It's really THE ENDGAME! Whatever the expectations i had, it had gone even beyond that whatsoever!!! Just watch it without knowing any spoilers! 11 years of hardwork paid off, GG Marvel!",positive
"It did its job at providing a satisfying conclusion for the quadrilogy. I don't think that it does anything exceptional or bad. Actually, that's not true. It does one thing exceptionally: It's three hours but I never felt the runtime. And it does something bad: The fat suit for Thor looked soooo fake.And I personally thought what they did with the Hulk was hilarious.But I'm honestly sick of Marvel at this point. I'm sick of superheroes and supervillains and the whole interrupting the plot to make a joke thing. And I can only see myself watching this again if someone else wants to watch it. I'm glad The Boys is a thing!",positive
I hate what they did with Thor. Thor is the only reason I have ever read comics. In the comics he was the epitome of honor and bravery. He is now a joke. Brakes my heart. And there is no turning back from this story line. Even if he turns around from this 5 years of weakness. I'll never look up to the MCU Thor like I did to the Comic book Thor.,positive
"As others said, the time travel part just stinks. I still enjoyed it, I laughed on the jokes, there were moments where I nearly cried, and others that made me clap with all along the audience. But overall the who whole story is quite an illogical mess. There's the saying ""they bit more than they can chew"". This is exactly what happened, they tried to fill all their previous movies into one and it could actually work, if they just fixed the time travel part. But they didn't, and I left the theatre with full of unanswered questions. Too bad, because there were so many good ideas, emotions, and great acting.",positive
"Reading the reviews and overall rating, clearly there was an audience for this movie, but I wasn't part of it.For me it was way too long and had way too many characters. Each character apparently had to have at least one super hero jump landing. A very overused and tired device. And, each character had to have at least one Zoolander, blue steel stare to the camera, before any fighting started. As these moments took up about an hour of the filming time, perhaps that explains the long run time.Then the story negates any lasting impact from the previous movie. Everything from the previous battle is irrelevant, because we can just go back in time and fix it. So assumably when the studios want to cash in again, Thanos can build a time machine after Infinity War, find out what happened in Endgame, and go back and fix that outcome. Next movie, the avengers steal the time machine and create another fix. Then in about another two sequels or so, the whole battle can be fought out again in the old west, with Doc, Marty, and Spider-Man driving the delorean, after some funny scenes where Thor helps him get his licence.The best way I can comment on this movie, is that I went to see it in the cinema with a 24yo friend. About half way through, I looked at him and he was asleep. I considered waking him up, but realised that whatever he was dreaming about, it had to be better than the movie.",negative
"For a fan who waited 11 years for this movie,Its a treat.Some are questioning about the ending but for a hardcore fan it was the most satisfying ending.Well done Russos, Brilliant writing, Masterpiece acting and justice to every character of the MCU.Some will be missed and MCU is changed now.
Most epic end to The Infinity Saga.
Love you 3000.",positive
"When i saw this movie in the theater the second weekend after it came out, I really enjoyed what it lived up to...the culmination of 10+ years of Marvel movies that were interconnected to each other through phases in a huge cinematic universe that has become the biggest one of them all...Marvel. Lasting for 3 hours and thankfully not having an after credit scene, Endgame, like the previous one, kills off a lot of major characters, with the first MCU hero to grace the big screen sacrificing himself with the gauntlet that he acquires from Thanos after defeating him and letting Dr. Strange use portals to bring back many of the good avengers from the dead and bring the universe to a conclusion. It ends with Captain america reuniting with his girlfriend back in the 1940s, after we see him in modern times aged so much. This was the last movie to feature Black Panther, as of this update the actor died overnight, leaving Marvel to consider a replacement for the late Chadwick Boseman for the upcoming sequel.",positive
I went to watch this film with high hopes and it did not disappoint me. It has the usual Marvel humor but at the same time the seriousness as plot calls for it.I'm not an emotional person and rarely cried watching a film but this one put tears into my eyes. It is by far one of the best superhero films.,positive
"Never have i cried front of poeple in cinemaxxNatasha and Tony! Rest in peace. Cap died but Roger still here, not long
It get 12 out of 10",positive
"I really liked this movie, but the plot holes. Wayyy too many plot holes and basically... with time travel unlocked they can do whatever now. Like, come on. Good idea but the execution was pretty awful. I still love the movie but I hate the billions of plot holes.",positive
"***Minor Spoilers (that may be significant for some)***Avengers: Endgame is what happens a group of devoted filmmakers set up shop and pay off a decade's worth of storytelling on the big screen in a bombastic yet surprisingly satisfying way. First off, to prove I saw the movie, it starts off with Clint's family getting 'dusted' right after the SNAP in Infinity War. And from then on, it's a post-disaster movie trying to address the previous movie's aftermath. All the while it becomes a Back to the Future-like adventure on steroids and it even has Terminator callbacks as well. And it's got the emotional gravitas of Toy Story 3. Oh: and Thor's chubby in this, and a MASSIVE troll online whenever Korg needs him to be (in ### ######). It's got taught writing with just as focused direction telling a story through the action as opposed to action taking over the story.SEE THIS MOVIE! It's as much movie a movie can get this year! And we've still got PLENTY of other goods on the horizon still.5/5 stars.",positive
"Pretty sure Robert Downey Jr got his lines wrong. What he clearly meant to say is back to the future is clearly a way better depiction of time travel. Long gone are the days where movies had real emotional empathy and believability, they must have got washed up in the shores of time. Great Scott, if only we could go back to when these film had tangible sets and characters with substance and weight. This movie begins where infinity war left off with half the population doing a disappearing act, involuntarily of course. Our main protagonist Iron Man is lost in space and somehow found out of nowhere with very little reason. The new kid on the block has a talent for picking out people from space with, with her arms, or so it would appear. Eat your heart out superman!! Yet we are willing to let most this go, the task of expanding the universe further seems exhausting enough. With a barrel load of character to tackle not even three hours can save this mess. Maybe because they have to stick to their Hollywood Marvel formula and get the routine thirty minute, am I watching a kid play Mortal Kombat? Battle scene in!! The only thing missing is the vintage finish him voice at the finale. Reminence of the battle scene in ""ready player one"" springs to mind. Don't misinterpret me I don't mind a well built up epic conclusion but unfortunate this felt like a reversal of what had already materialised in the previous outting. As far as character and acting goes our main bunch handled themselves to the usual standard. We had nice chemistry wisecracks and charisma throughout the film and with regards to pacing it's a little slow to start off with. It's a good thirty to forty five of we're getting the band back together!! Without giving too much away it is a very linear one dimension story but still packs a bit of a punch with some humour and emotion from time to time. With regards to empathy I felt more for the characters towards the end than in the early stages. I felt like they failed at the start where you should feel really sad for the friends they lost but they all seemed to have moved on five years on. Scarlett Johansson's character was the only one who made me feel like it had actually happened. Overall it was an average finish, nothing to go to mad about.",positive
"I was shocked, I seriously expected the worst for this movie and even held off watching it for ages after it came out because people just said it was so poorly done but in reality it was quite spectacular, for me anyway. I'm content with how this movie went and ended.",positive
"There is spectacle, although like a lot of massive CGI battles, you can't figure out what the hell is going on (Frankly, Hawkeye's sword fight with another human might have been the most coherent fight). There are SOME tender moments that work (and others that don't). There were lots of funny moments, usually provided by Thor.All in all, a capable action flick. But, it could have been so much more, if they'd gone full nerd. Why do I say that? Because nerds would have got ""power"" situation right. The heroes powers fluctuate so greatly between movies, and even within the movie that it could drive a purist mad. There is nothing wrong with fantasy movies (e.g. sci-fi, space, Hobbit, etc.), but the worlds need to be internally consistent to be fun. Also, the ""cavalry charge"" at the end of all these movies is getting tiresome. (But, I get the ""nick of time"" stuff generically pumps up the ""dramatic tension.""...a little)Anyway, it isn't top 10 of the MCU, but it's probably top 15. I'd still probably see Deadpool over and over again, rather than continue to see these middling, mass produced, corporate exercises. Like Star Wars the early years with Lucas instead of Disney. These corporate movies will never endanger the golden goose, or do anything surprising.",positive
One of the worst movies I've ever seen. A terrible way to wrap up 22 movies. Absolute garbage.,negative
"Q: Can you review this film without spoiling anything?
A: Not really, sorry.Q: Well can you answer a few questions about it without spoiling anything?
A: SureQ: Was it good?
A: Yes. Very good.Q: Did it feel like 3 hours?
A: No... even though it was fairly leisurely paced for about the first hour or so, I never felt bored or restless.Q: Did it meet expectations?
A: More or less- and they were high to begin with.Q: How necessary is it to watch the previous Marvel movies before this one?
A: Very. This has the most call-backs to the previous MCU movies out of any so far, which is fitting given that it's an ""ending"" of sorts to the previous 20 or so movies.Q: Did you cry?
A: No, but I'm jaded and wouldn't be surprised if other people did.Q: Did you laugh?
A: Yeah it was pretty funny, without sacrificing the more serious stuff. Similar to how the humour was handled in Infinity War.Q: Speaking of Infinity War, was it better than Endgame?
A: I dunno, hard to say right now. They're both about on the same level for me.Q: How was the Stan Lee cameo?
A: A bit rubbish to be honest, especially if this is to be his last.Q: You gonna keep watching these Marvel movies after this one?
A: Probably. If this is the last one I ever saw I think I could live with that. But if there are still interesting stories to tell and talented filmmakers who want to make them, then I'll be there.",positive
"It is made with great CG and it does not make me bored even though it runs for three hours. However, it is better to watch all of marvel films. I did not do it so I could not get some point.",positive
"Amazing. Absolutely amazing and heartbreaking. Triumphant. Breathtaking. And soul crushing. Someone asked me what I thought of Endgame...and all I could respond with was, there are so many words! There are so many reasons why this was the perfect superhero movie...I wouldn't have time to name them all. Do I have my gripes? Yes. I do. Maybe it's because I still haven't seen all the MCU movies that led up to this one. Or. Maybe it's because I was sitting in the front row on the right side, so I had to look at the screen as though I were watching a tennis match. Back and forth and back and forth. Whatever the case, I was in complete shock. And I laughed so hard I cried a bit. I smiled nonstop. I was so taken aback that I gasped, held my breath while covering my mouth for extended periods of time. My heart was broken multiple times to where I ugly cried uncontrollably. Even now, hours after watching the movie, I feel so destroyed by certain moments that my eyes weld with tears just thinking of those scenes. I cheers for the men who did the damn thing. I cheered for the women who banded together and rocked. I cheered for the black characters that many thought shouldn't be or shouldn't have made it. I cheered for Captain America. He was always worthy. I respect the Black Widow. I cheered for love. And second chances. This movie gave us everything we needed and more. I will watching it a million times over because every now and again, I'll need reminding that someone out there loves me 3,000.",positive
"Endgame is too long.
Why is that a problem?
Because the length prevents the film from truly soaring to the heights achieved by Infinity War.
I love the MCU and was as geeked out as anyone for Endgame, but I have to be honest.
So here we go.....The movie is largely built around the original 6 Avengers and that's fine to set up the film, however, Endgame takes a VERY long time to get any real momentum.
A VERY long time.
It isn't until Ant Man arrives that any life is injected into the film.
So here are a few let downs in my opinion...1. Captain Marvel is little more than a cardboard cutout and the personality she expressed in her movie is nowhere to be found.
2. You will be very disappointed if you enjoy seeing ""Hulk Smash!""
3. You will be very disappointed if you hope to see much of Black Panther, Loki, Bucky, Nick Fury, Groot, or Gomorrah.
4. The film rarely lets loose the personalities we've all come to enjoy in Rocket, Star Lord, Happy, or even Captain Marvel for that matter.Now for some positives:1. There are some very good laughs that thankfully lift up the long run time.
2. Its a blast revisiting some moments from past MCU films.
3. It's nice to see the female empowerment themes and the potential set up for the Young Avengers
4. You can go to the restroom without missing something truly crucial. Seriously.Overall: Endgame is 30 minutes too long and this prevents the film from achieving a solid and consistent pace.
It allows moments where we have to think about the ""science"" behind the action.
The emotional highs and lows are simply not as impactful as Infinity War and some serious stuff happens in Endgame.
The climax is enjoyable, however we have waited over 2 hours to see if our favorite characters from the extended MCU are going to appear and by this time the climax has to be compressed into a 45 minute ""epic"" battle that is barely on par with the battle of Infinity War.In short, Endgame is inferior to Infinity War.
I should have felt deep sadness at times throughout the film and the movie was unable to create that feeling in me.
I wanted to feel the same highs I felt with Infinity War, but those highs were few and fleeting.It wraps the Avengers MCU in a beautiful box, but when opened, I was underwhelmed.
I got my money's worth in sheer length, but that running time was detrimental to my ability to deeply invest.Sean",positive
"Having followed the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the last eleven years, Endgame proves to be an extremely satisfying conclusion to the current phase. The damage had been done in Infinity War (which I thought was superior from a storyline perspective) and it's up to the remaining Avengers to undo the catastrophe. The route that they take is pretty far-fetched (yes, there's a time-travel subplot involved; and that's not a spoiler!), but entertaining nonetheless. An attempt is made to retrieve each of the six Infinity Stones from different timelines thereby negating the destruction done by Thanos.It takes a while before the Avengers assemble once again - Thor is chilling (and growing fat in the process) with his buddies in a make-believe Asgard; Stark is enjoying his family life; Banner is living a life as a Banner-Hulk mutation; Rogers, Natasha, Rocket, Danvers, Rhodey, and a few others are responsible for (low-key) taking care of unruly happenings around the world (and reporting them to base). But it's the return of two major characters (Barton and Lang) who were absent during the events of Infinity War that sets the story in motion once again. Once the team is reunited and their strategy is unfolded, Endgame gets super engaging.I like how the Russos retained the Ragnarok vibe for Thor. He regrets his decision of not having aimed for Thanos' head when the had the chance to. In Endgame, he's got a beer belly, loves video-games (and an indoor life), and has grown a scraggly beard. He's still got a great sense of humor though. And what could have been an abomination of a character instead, turns out to be more-than-exciting. Stark, on the other hand, has settled down into a quiet countryside life with his wife Pepper and daughter Morgan. Cap is the only one among the lead trio who hasn't 'retired' officially and is still dispensing his Avenger duties in a less showy manner. The screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, in fact, provides emotional closure for almost all the lead characters that drove the MCU to its massive success in the last decade. That way, Endgame is an astounding success.But, in the process, the film also reduces Thanos to a plain-vanilla bad guy as opposed to his reason-driven intentions in Infinity War. I believe there is no cinematic device that's more difficult to pull off than 'time-travel' and here too, it's got some issues. X-Men: Days of Future Past was one movie that managed to effectively work it out. In Endgame, everything is explained very briefly (while dissing Back To The Future and The Terminator movies) in a way that it needs to make sense only when the concept is in question and not throughout the entire film. Well, maybe it does. Every change made to the original timelines would, in fact, result in a divergent timeline and altered character choices and motivations.With the humongous cast at their disposal, the Russos had to get things going rather quickly even with a 188-minute run-time. Also, the MCU has always been a character-driven franchise, and it did make sense to offer significant scenes to some of its earliest heroes. It's an enthralling journey, however you look at it, and it leaves the ardent MCU fan teary-eyed at the end of it all. The time-travel plot could have benefited from better detailing, but the Russos keep the proceedings fast-paced in the latter half so that the viewer doesn't go bonkers over the elucidation of alternate realities and timelines.Thankfully, it focuses on closing the books of Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man more compared to the rest. As an MCU fan from 2008 (right from the first Iron Man flick), I feel that was what I'd expected, and I couldn't have asked for a better ending (at least, from an emotional standpoint).",positive
"Sometimes I feel like some IMDb trolls purposefully downvote something to keep overrated movies at the top of the all time list. I don't remember a movie matching and exceeding THIS big of hype. It's a great ending to a crapload of marvel movies. Makes you want to go back and watch all of them again. Plus when can you remember the last time you actually weren't sure if a character was going to die or if the good guys were going to win. If you didn't have at least a tad of doubt, you're in denial. Infinity War was a tiny bit better imo but they are both epic! Every movie is going to have plot holes if you sit there and pick it apart forever. Guaranteed you could claim plot holes in q documentary if you tried (these days i wouldnt doubt some idiot has). Good for you, you are so smart! No fooling you! Enjoy the entertainment and eat some popcorn. Let yourself enjoy life and dont worry about wanting to be pissed off/unimpressed all the time. My goodness. 10/10",positive
"I'm a bit disappointed on the melodramatic first act. It was a really, really poorly written melodramatic first act.It was, with Black Panther and Hulk, the most boring passage of a Marvel MCU movie. Some great parts here and there (mostly Tony, which was basically god like perfect in this movie, including Downey's perfect acting) and Rocket.When the actual movie starts (and stops being basically an epilogue, a bad one, to Infinity War), it gets interesting even if a bit confusing (even with three hours, the plot explanation goes fast).And in the end, the movie lands the epic ending. No words necessary.Also, I would never watch that first hour and a half again. Which is a shame, considering how perfect Infinity War was.-------Oh I forgot (this is an edit). Captain Marvel was in this movie (barely). I absolutely ADORE HER in every aspect. Her attitude. Her character. The actress. The looks.But oh boy, her power level! Don't know if it's good or bad yet",positive
"Solid movie. The banter between the characters that most know so well is often hysterical. The problem with this movie is that its stuffed with unnecessary scenes that serve to make it too long, and more of a ""greatest hits"" than a coherent plot. The time travel theory kind of makes sense, until Cap shows up as a too young World War Two ninety eight year old man at the end...an impossibility given the logic used in the movie. Other scenes dealing with Hawkeye and even the final battle should've been shortened or eliminated...like Cap as some sort of self help counselor. I wonder about the future of Avenger ""group"" movies given the death of Ironman and sidelining of Captain America. Seems Marvel has basically killed off the golden goose. I guess time will tell.",positive
"The movie was great, there's no doubt about it, but that was it. Coming off the shock value that Infinity War brought meant that nothing in this film surprised me, actually there really wasn't any surprises- everything was just as you'd expect it, which was slightly disappointing in itself. I remember after infinity war, people in the cinema were speechless, crying, sobbing, hugging each other - there was nothing like that here. I wish there were more surprises. It was also a little slow overall but at the same time a good celebration of the last 11 years.",positive
"The plot was messy, and so vast, with so many amazing characters, who were all simply diluted into one giant mess of a movie. Didn't really find the humour amazing either.",negative
"No Spoilers review ?!
I think it would be rude to ask for a more better version of this story..To be honest There is no satisfying ending.. it's always what was best possible way.. Avengers End game makes you realise that your superhero whom you always considered Mentality of steel and Heart full of Power...They are also Human They deserved the life they wanted...And this movie is perfect capturing of what they could do with so less time left on their side...This movie is brilliant, unparalleled dedication..I am happy as well as sad to see this End of an era...But Eventually everything comes to end..So is the movie... Thank you Avengers ! For making our virtual and real world both happy 😊",positive
"I read some of the negative reviews and noticed that a lot of them started to get repetitive ""time travel didnt make sense"" how did Cap get old"" ""so there is 2 Caps"" ""Why is Sam Cap now"" and on and on... if you watched the movies and tv shows some of the questions would be answered and if you paid attention in this movie most of the questions were answered. They say time travel dosent work like in other time travel movies altering something in the past dosent mess with your timeline it just creates a new one and yours keeps going as is... they say this 3 times (Tony, Bruce and the Ancient One all say this) and if you have a problem with that theroy, when they made the movie they talked to actual physicists and scientists about it and that's their theory.
Yes there was 2 Caps, one in ice and one living with Peggy. After Cap took the stones and the hammer back he stayed with peggy in the past. In the show Agent Carter they say Peggy is Married but are very secretive about who to. Yes Cap didnt get involved in events because he knew how they would turn out so he left it be, and he did not get teleported to the site as an old man, he knew when to be there and just showed up as an old guy. Then he gave to shield to Sam because he trusted sam to be a good Captin America as he was in the comics too. Sam as Cap is stright from the comics.
Why did Tony have to die... because he did. This last 10 years was his story. It started with him and this chapter ended with him. He found peace and some thing worth protecting and dying for. It was a fitting end.
The Hulk. Clearly anyone complaining about the Hulk and Banner sharing the body dosent know about ""Professor Hulk"" again.. lifted stright from the comics.
Like I said in the title... just because you dont understand something or you were too busy being a troll to care dosent make it a plot hole. Enjoy the movie for what it is... a great super hero movie filled with fun nods to fans of the movies, t.v. shows and comics. It was good... don't let the trolls sway you.The only reason I am giving this a 9 instead of a 10 is because Thor (while a great character) clearly had some intense mental health issues going on and a couple times there was jokes made about it. And although seeing his mom helped I feel like there could have a conversation with Cap or someone where he talked about it.",positive
"Avengers Endgame is not only better than Avengers Infinity War, this film is better than The Dark Knight! Avengers Endgame is also one of the best movies I have ever seen! It's very emotional and it's satisfying. The storytelling is top notch. And the third act is so emotional and it almost made me cry. And the ending of this film is very bittersweet. The avengers assemble scene is a dream come true with everyone that was dusted in Infinity War coming back. Captain America lifting Mjolnir was a great twist. And Iron Man's sacrifice was amazing and emotional. I also loved the fat Thor story arc and it really made sense from a storytelling point of view. Endgame is the perfect ending to the MCU's infinity saga. This film has also made me appreciate infinity war even more. Not only is Endgame the best comic book film ever, but it is a MASTERPIECE!",positive
"This is a worthy follow up, one of the most action packed, emotional, and well made movie in such a long time! Every actor is at their BEST! And when a scene hits hard, it REALLY hits hard. Great Effects are also showcased throughout this film. Their is a reason that this movie is blowing up, because fortune favors the bold!

"Well, this has been what we all have been waiting for quite some time now. 10 years in making, characters we grew find of and vast and complex storylines. They all have ended up to this movie. I wanted to watch this movie on the opening night and couldn't wait to get in. As someone who has been following the Marvel universe fairly thoroughly and watched almost all of the movies leading to this one multiple times, to be honest, I wasn't blown away. The problem for me was that while I was enjoying the movie, I couldn't help but to realize this is going to be THE last one, so all of a sudden I wasn't that impress with the way many scenes were being handled. Especially, when you compare it to some of the other Marvel movies which were fantastic. If I were to single out one problem, it would be poor writing. I don't know whether they had time issue or spmething else but the material is so weak and the dialogues are so forgettable and superficial that were robbing the beauty out of the fantastic visual effects and sound effects and acceptable directing and casting. There were numerous occasions I was literally yearning for a killer line by the characters to hit me write in the heart and lingers with me for the rest of my life but the magic was far far from there. It was weird in a sense that they have already had many splendid writings in the Marvel movies to this date but why the most important chapter (the finale) should be like this is truly astonishing. All in all, it is not a bad movie in any ways but for the folks who have been following the Marvel movies seriously or semi-seriously, you will be a little disappointed that why this potential has been wasted in this way.",positive
"This film is the conclusion of the infinity saga series containing all 22 films for the past 10 years. Plotwise is great. It's a great storytelling. Few scenes are weird but acceptable. Marry Sue? Very few. OP? Just very few. It's reasonable and fun to watch every minutes. Nebula's arc is good and the actress is great. Every 6 main character's arcs including Ant-man are decent. There are shocks and twists but reasonable also. Characters from the past return and add very good additional contexts. The screenwriters, directors and producers made a good job. The CGI is good and realistic. The acting is world class. Many characters but they lifts up each other in the good way. Every actors are great.
I can see myself go back to watch it ten times, and I can do this all day.
Enjoy :)
I actually rate this movie 9.6/10, but lean towards 10.",positive
"I loved Infinity. Full of action, the story wasn't bad, the Avengers lost which is obviously different, and the cliff hanger. All that tee'd up and we got this?The first 2 hours are so boring!!! You're better off skipping it but overview; What's left of the Avengers trying to live life 5 years after the snap, Ant Man comes back from the Quantum Realm and in the world he's been in he's only been gone 5 hours, not 5 years. So time travel is figured out, they all travel back to get the stones and bring everyone back. That is your first 2 hours, small pieces of action here and there but really boring.Things finally pick up once they've done the time travel back with all the stones, snap, Thanos and company are brought back too and finally you have the movie this is supposed to be, nothing but action!But then it occurred to me, even with all the action at the end they still screwed up. What was the point of the cliff hanger with Captain Marvel at the end of Infinity? In End Game, she barely had any part in the movie. She's saves Tony and Nebula in boring fashion at the beginning, she helps kill Thanos in boring fashion at the beginning (he's practically dead already from using the stones a 2nd time,) and then she's just gone. Doesn't help get the stones or snap (figured she woulda been the one,) the end fight is half done and she finally shows up, destroying the huge ship which was cool, but that was it. She actually gets a 1-on-1 with Thanos and it's obvious she can beat him but he easily outsmarts her and............... that's it, her character was done. Again what was the point with the cliff hanger, her stand alone before this movie, just to barely have any major part to this one.And adding in all the female heros doing a little ""girl power, super hero"" pose was real corny.It was obvious this movie would pull in $2billion+, it's an Marvel Avengers movie and after how good Infinity was, it was all a given. But as a movie, this was a huge miss",positive
"Like I said when I reviewed the last film, Infinity War, the Avengers seem to get better with each film (and longer it seems). The Russo brothers have become great storytellers over the last few years, and have been great at keeping the story secret. This film is the culmination of more than twenty films over the past eleven years, and it is extremely epic!There are some twists and turns in this film that you might not see coming, but are essential to the Avengers story-line. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll love this chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I definitely see this film up for multiple Academy Awards in 2020, maybe even Best Picture; its that good.",positive
"I had to think on my rating and review quite carefully for this film, as the final part of the movie elevates it from the rest of it.If I had to summarize this movie in one word it would be ""convoluted"".
They take a sci-fi trope that always causes problems due to logic issues and went full steam ahead with it. The first two hours of the movie were quite unexpected, and by that I mean underwhelming, for the final movie in a decade long storyline.The movie comes into its own and gives the fanbase geekgasms about 20 minutes to the end, but it wasn't enough in my opinion. I have rated it a 7 as I truly enjoyed the way it concluded.There were a couple of scenes that made me laugh, but if as I wrote earlier, the final 20 - 30 minutes of Endgame are better than the previous 2 and a half hours of it, as there are too many flaws in logic and even the directors and screenwriters are not on the same page in their interviews as to how things are supposed to work.I won't bother with a suggestion of should you go see it or not, but unless you are truly blinded by love for the franchise, don't expect a masterpiece or the best film from Marvel so far.",positive
"... and what let down! Slow to develop and fast and furious action in the end. The whole story line was awful and the ending pretty much may have been the ""endgame"" for me, in watching it any further. You may have to watch it to understand the future development - with new heros and old ones gone - but this has now become more of a ""transformer"" type kid series. So bye, bye for me.",negative
"So I love this movie, but there's a couple things that just irk me. The first being Thor. They made a complete joke out of him. I get that he's in a terrible state of mind, but they just kept trying to make him the laughing stock. To go along with this, they also put in a little too much comedy for my liking. The avengers are trying to restore the universe and so much is on the line, yet they are cracking jokes left and right. (Example: Hulk scene when transporting Ant Man through time). Lastly, a small thing that I wonder about is how Nebula didn't think to tell anyone that Thanos would be looking the stones when they chose to go back in time. She told Rhodey so obviously she knew it was something to be cautious about but didn't tell the rest of the team.Overall it's a good film, but I felt they put in too much comedy. I get they have to cater to a large audience since younger kids are watching, but cmon they are the avengers and it's up to them to restore billions of lives and they have one chance. In Infinity war there was a more serious tone and that is why I rank it above Endgame.",positive
"It is a spellbinding and enthralling experience to watch Avengers: Endgame, which marks the end of the Infinity Saga. Marvel's last film is remarkable and does not disappoint. We can't even describe how amazing it is to have our favorite superheroes in one film. Since releasing 'Iron Man', Marvel has been working on this grand culmination. All of their effort, work and ambition have paid off, I'm sure. It delivers an unforgettable experience thanks to directors Anthony and Joe Russo. Markus and McFeely wrote an unpredictable and epic screenplay. There is a great balance between humor, emotions, and action in the film. Emotions are the film's greatest strength. I have never seen a superhero film this emotional. There's nothing better than this. I was blown away by the action sequences. I was astonished by the climactic battle. There are just so many memorable moments in this film that it cannot be described in words. Throughout the film, the visuals are stunning and have a great impact. In spite of the film's exaggerated humor, it manages to entertain the audience throughout. It was a very suspenseful and impressive plot twist. There are many cameos from previous MCU films in the film, which adds to the excitement. Although I've listened to it several times, the background score still gives me goosebumps. The way the Hulk was changed as a character was really clever. I really enjoyed that. But Robert Downey Jr., who plays Tony Stark/Iron Man, steals the show. The person who started it all once again demonstrates that no one else can perform the role to its highest standard. Don't miss his pivotal moments in the decisive conflict.",positive
"First off, the things I liked:
The fight scenes were great, every single second of the final battle was thrilling and exciting.
The fan service. It was a great payoff of 11 years of character development, and it shows.
CGI was really good for almost all the movie.
Now the things I didn't like:
The jokes were really out of place, and the timing was off, something really rare about marvel.
Thor was a running joke for almost the whole film. After infinity war, where Thor was one of the most enjoyable characters to watch, this new fat Thor felt really forced, out of place and he constantly acted like a coward.",positive
If you felt underwhelmed the first time. I suggest you see it again,positive
"Avengers Endgame is truly one of the best epic films ever made..
This film literally made entire theatre whistle, laugh, cry, sad and shout their lungs out!!!
There are few moments which will make every marvel cry, no matter how hard they hold onto....",positive
"The Russo Bro's should be commended by what they brought to the BIG SCREEN! this movie is GOLD! everything about it is non-stop fun, emotional thrill ride especially if you have followed the franchise for years. The tears will fall but the smiles will grow bigger than ever before. Some say 3 hours is too long but it's not long enough, I could spend forever growing with these Hero's and the wonderful actors portraying them, feel like a kid again and wishing I was a superhero! Heartwarming in all the right places. 10/10 my favorite movie of all time!",positive
"Without a doubt, that's a movie which visuals are stunning as always. That does not disappoint.
My main concerns are with the story, some unbelievable situations and battles. The results are not always what you expect, which IMO lowers the rating.It would be a better movie, if the seriousness of situations was increased throughout and the whole current of the movie was based on more active, wild and shocking battles.",positive
"Such a beautiful way to end such a fantastic series...or, rather, to end this chapter. Marvel has really outdone themselves and no other film could put that many avengers/superheroes on one screen and make it that good. I hope you haven't spoiled the movie for yourself if you are at all hesitant...whether it be fear of disappointment or not wanting to sit there for 3+ hours. Anyone that has kept up with all the movies will be blown away. Thank you Russo Brothers for making such a beautiful film.",positive
"More of the same - following Thanos' elimination of half the life in the Universe, the remaining Avengers decide to go back in time (or to an alternative time path, this is not really clear) to yet again look for the Infinity Stones so they can try to reverse the malignant halving. Since the stones are scattered around the Universe, once again a number of sub-adventures ensue, then there is yet another huge battle in which everyone in the MCU gets at least a cameo (including Captain Marvel and Scarlet Witch, so everyone else could have just gone fishing). Since the plot includes time-travel/alternate realities and infinitely powerful wish-fulfilment anything can happen, so just watch, don't think. Smart Hulk and Fat Thor are a lot less interesting than their predecessors and one can't help but wonder why the least powerful (and least interesting) Avengers are sent into space rather than participate in the more mundane search in the past (or whatever) or could the filmmakers have found an actress who looked less like a Valkyrie from Teutonic myth than Tessa Thompson. While clearly a fan pleaser, I found the film overly-long, derivative, and generally uninteresting. Too bad, as I really liked 2018's 'Infinity War'.",positive
"This movie sets up the rules of time travel - the no paradox approach, where whatever you do in the past have already been done at lead to this point - but forgets it midway: Thanos jumps ahead of events that have not happened yet.
Go and watch Dark instead. That's actually interesting and plays in a different league of science, storytelling, everything.Oh, and the ever moving cameras. PLEASE STOP ALWAYS MOVING THE CAMERAS, I beg you, Hollywood. It's annoying, it's not how people see, it's cheap. Take a look at old, classic cinematography instead and make the cuts simply better.",negative

"Avengers: Endgame is the fourth Avengers film and the newest film from the Marvel film series. The film is directed by the Russo brothers, who also directed the previous Avengers film Avengers: Infinity War.After the actions of Thanos (Josh Brolin) from the previous Avengers movie, the remaining Avengers have to deal with the consequences of their loss. Still, the Avengers must eventually look for a way to defeat Thanos and see if there is a way to undo his dark actions.With this fourth Avengers film, the Russo brothers and scriptwriters were able to put a nice end to the eleven-year series of 22 films. The Russo brothers have also done their best to fill the film further with things that Marvel fans would like to see or they provide answers to some unanswered questions from previous Marvel films. For most Marvel fans this film can come across as a satisfactory ending.
Although this film comes across as the end of the series, they have left enough free space for the next phase of the Marvel film series. They have already planned some new films and TV series for the future. Although they have these new plans, these new films will probably no longer be able to reach the same level as they did with Avengers Endgame and the eleven-year build-up to this film.
Despite these future plans, they do not give anything away for the next phase of Marvel. This Marvel film, for example, has no extra scenes that still appear in the film during or after the credits. In this way, when the film is over and the lights in the room turn on again, you can actually leave the room. The only reason to remain seated during the credits is if you may want to know the names of people who have worked on certain things in the film.The atmosphere and tempo of Endgame are also different compared to Infinity War, because In Infinity War there were more action scenes and intense events that they managed to play at a relatively fast pace, but still had enough room for humorous moments. In Endgame they have a more dramatic atmosphere after losing to Thanos. The pace can also seem a bit slower, because they are mainly busy processing their loss at the beginning of the film, but also planning what they can do best now.The effects in the film also look good and credible. This way they know how to convey or bring certain things in this film in fun and creative ways. They must have used a lot of CGI and a green screen for these effects, but this is hardly reflected in the film.The acting work is also done well. Many actors and actresses can be seen in this film in their famous roles. Most of the remaining Avenger characters are also in different locations or in a different life status than we are used to. In this way, the actors who play these roles have also had the opportunity to present their known roles in a different way. In this film every hero gets his own personal moment to shine. They know for example Captain Marvel, who in her own film was not received equally positively by everyone, in a somewhat better way.",positive
"Hey Guys! Here are some quick few highlights of story.*Hulk and Bruce banner becomes one character like talking scientist Hulk*Ant-man came out from quantom room and with help of bruce banner and iron man created time machine as ant-man experienced already.*everyone went back by using time machine to 1970 Captain America Time and Avengers 2012 time to collect the stones and make infinity gauntlet and use it to bring back other people to life.
and they succeeded in collecting stones bringing back all the other character but the problem is when they went back in time thanos counter them and thanos follow them back to come in actual time line 2019.* so there is thanos comes in 2019 (without infinity gauntlet) because he is from past but he knows everything and came with his Epic Army Thanos Army+Loki Avengers 2012 Army+Thanos+ dark creatues to get his infinity gauntlet and kill everyone on earth and on the other side the whole Assgaurd Force+wakanda force+earth force+dr.strange force+ all of the evengers (back to life) an amazing beautiful and tremendous epic battle at the end.*Iron man, scarlet jhonson dead at the end, hulk lost his hand for using infinity gauntlet to bring back other and kill all the dark creatures.*A beautiful Tremendous and Amazing film I loved the film and the film was much better than my expectations and twisted story and just loved the film. (its not good that iron man gone but may be he will be back because avengers have time machine and also the infinity gauntlet)A Must Watch Film, Best Regards",positive
"A 3H BEHEMOTH of a finale to a truly unique phenomenon in cinema: a legacy, a build-up, even, of 21 movies over 11 years into this moment. While the movie does reward knowing all the characters, only the main bunch have to be known, and it's obviously best if you've seen Infinity War, since it is the ending of that movie that directly leads into this one, like one big two-parter movie. Heck, it was even shot back-to-back. The two movies combined stand just shy of 5h45"", which is an insane time.
At the time of writing, there are a total of 23 movies, with close to a dozen announced for the near future. The 23 movies, up to SM: Far From Home would take over 41 hours to watch!
Back the Endgame. It is a heart-wrenching movie, as the characters we have grown to love reach the end of their arcs, and sometimes lives; jam-packed with action and humour (except for the cringy Fortnite reference. Damn you MarvelxEpicGames!! Also Hulk dab was cringy but it was also funny, and kinda made sense? But the fortnite thing really taints the movie. Even if Thor swearing at some internet lowlife is funny, and shows just how low he has gone, from fighting literal Gods to... Noobmaster69. Fat Thor was hilarious, as well as being a nice body message (""I'm still worthy!""), although it is my headcanon that the end fight would have been much easier had Thor been his good old buff self. Sure, beer belly is fine, and those who matter will love you for it, but it still doesn't beat abs my dude.
[EDIT: I've thought about it for a while, and also heard other people's opinions, who take it much harsher than I do, but fat Thor was funny and all... But I sincerely hope they revert back to buff Thor again, because it's just better].
It takes an interesting take on time travel, which is a scary topic in a lot of movies, and handles it surprisingly really well! That being said, the movie feels very geared towards us young'uns who grew up watching the movies. My dad, an avid cinema watcher, who does enjoy a lot of the movies in the MCU (although he didn't enjoy GotG, so take that as you will, to understand his different tastes), would probably have some trouble keeping up as everything happens very quickly. That being said, I love how the movie slows down for nobody, the music is another masterpiece in the series, thank you Alan Silvestri (note to Danny Elfman for doing Age of Ultron's music). The cinematography is stunning, the special effects are nothing short of otherworldly, and Captain Marvel has less screen time than Black Widow's PB sandwich, so that's nice (because seriously, that woman is nasty off camera, and a lame addition on camera. I hate superman for the same reasons. Too strong, always the same cryptonite bs. It's a deus ex machina. They made her so powerful she just has to be ""absent"", ""saving other planets"" because Thanos surely isn't a big enough priority. Big Lame.).
Of course, it's also notably the first movie to ever overtake J. Cameron's Avatar, (the one which nobody really remembers cause it was so darn generic), and therefore taking the number one highest grossing film (of course, not adjusted for inflation, or Disney's hard push for this including a rerelease with 'extra footage'). Back on topic, while definitely one of the most emotionally charged movies in cinema as far as I'm concerned, it does have a very long legacy to build this up. Consequently, it's hard for me to determine this movie's standalone value. Is it fair to exclude it from its context? I think at least a link to IW needs to be made, since they're two parts of the same movie, really. In any case, the crown jewel in Marvel's crown.",positive
"Writing, effects and acting is brilliant in this movie.Before watching this film, make sure you've watched all other marvel films in revolving around the characters, or prepare to have much go over your head.",positive
"The comic book hero genre is what I call ""bulk viewing"". A mass produced product that has a formula that's repeated over and over, with a few tweaks here and there, to keep the viewer coming back for more.Avengers: Endgame is yet another case in question. I knew it going in and was in no way surprised by a predictable end to a mostly predictable story.Its not bad as such. In fact, if you can accept it for what it is, its quite watchable on a superficial level. I'll add I'm not a film snob I enjoy a simple action romp from time to time and this certainly comes recommended.There's a lot of wall to wall action that's well paced and keeps kicking along. My only gripe is the overcooked ending, that's so syrupy and sentimental, you could spread it on toast.7/10 from me.",positive
"Again this is no spoilers at all, even no hints. First off I was spoiled a lot of aspects of the movie, so knew what I was expecting and still really really enjoyed it. The story and how it plays out is incredible and really clever. Rather being like infinity war with a large focus on Thanos and action scenes, this is definitely an avengers movie (the original 6 mainly) that is very character and relationship orientated. There isn't as much action until the third act and my god, the third act, imagine what you hoped for it and times it by 1000000. It's absolutely glorious. The second act was also so well done and such a fun thing to watch and piece together. The reasons why I have given it a 8 is because there are some issues I have with it, for a movie with such stakes I wish they took it a bit more seriously, and I think was too humerous and light hearted for what's going on, which meant significant tonal shifts for me personally. Also I feel like the first act was a little slow, although i perfectly understand why, and it was necessary for the story they were trying to tell but I wish there could of been an extra action sequence or something in the first act, as just a little extra. Also a scene or 2 in the third act, were a little disappointing and forced. And although there certainly is a lot of fan service in it, it makes the movie more enjoyable, although a little cliche/predictable. Overall I enjoyed this movie, it probably would of been a 9 for me if I wasn't spoiled anything. I enjoyed it just as much as infinity war, although very different movies (pacing and story wise). Would recommend for all MCU fans, however it doesn't hold your hand and you need to have watched previous movies in order for it to make complete sense, which could be a turn off for casual movie goers.",positive
"The movie is overrated and just about average as compared to Civil war or infinity war. Overly melodramatic. Takes about 2 hours to for all the characters to come to terms with reality.
There is just one good fight scene where Thanos takes one on one a couple of avengers. After that the fight becomes a messed up playground and one cant make who is fighting whom. Just too many characters in fight.Infinity war was way better in way it handled the story plot and characters.",positive
"I was so excited to see this movie. 1.5 hours later I walked out from sheer boredom. First movie I have ever walked out of. If it was a normal length feature, I would have suffered through the whole thing, but knowing I have another 1.5 hours to go made me want to cry in misery. I left my husband and ran errands ... THAT is how boring it was.Boredom aside, there were so many eye rolling moments that left me surprised with the praise this movie received. AND if you have ever studied physics and the theories of time travel ... I'd suggest you do yourself a favor and leave this for the flat earthers.",negative
"Avengers Endgame is the conclusion to 11 years worth of MCU build up. A 3 hour long epic superhero adventure packed with eye candy action and emotional moments that suffers from a few minor inconsistencies in story and characters. The promotional material has been incredibly vague and therefore I'll keep it too with this review too to not ruin the fun. After the 'events' of Infinity War, the Avengers are forced to reassemble and take on Thanos (Josh Brolin) once more. That's all I'll say about the plot. I was genuinely surprised with the direction that was taken for many characters. Unlike Infinity War, the heroes are in front center this time. There were genuine arcs that made me love and feel for these characters yet again and all of the actors were fantastic. Robert Downey jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth are at the centre of this movie and there characters were all the best, emotional and surprising for me. Especially Ruffalo lightened up the mood with a comedic performance. At this point the chemistry and comradeship between the Avengers is undeniably the best part of these films. Just seeing these characters on screen talking and interacting was truly amazing. The conversations and relationships they share with each other is vital to the films success and it absolutely delivers. The humour is on point, the dialogue snappy and real and the fight just as brutal and significant as before. All other actors too gave very effective performance but I will admit that there were two that disappointed me a little. Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) and surprisingly Josh Brolin (Thanos). I haven't seen Captain Marvel but the use of her character in Endgame didn't do much for me. She had no personality and Larson (a terrific actress) didn't have the inviting charisma that a Scarlett Johansson has. Whilst he stole the show in Infinity War, Brolin's Thanos is merely reduced to a big evil villain in this film. I get that most of the screen time and story was dedicated to the Avengers and that Infinity War was Thanos' movie. But if I'm supposed to judge Endgame as a film on its own, his character definitely felt underused. Some jumbled story parts that best shouldn't be overly analysed aside. Avengers Endgame is an absolutely experience from start to finish. Perhaps the best film in the MCU yet I don't know how they can possibly top this. Wrapped up with a nice bow and tie, Endgame is a satisfying blockbuster for all fans of the MCU and superhero films in general.",positive
"ENDGAME is not what you're expecting, yet it's also exactly the impressive epic you're chasing. It takes our central heroes to new places and wraps up Marvel's decade-long journey so beautifully. The ending is emotionally overwhelming. I'm thankful to the entire team for giving us a special movie that will long live in our heart.",positive
"Just got back from Endgame here in N.Z and it will make you laugh , cry , clap and be emotionally spent but it's well worth it ! cancel everything this weekend and go and see it . Endgame is the event movie of a life time ! it is superior to Infinity War for sure and Endgame fly's by the 3 hours feel more like 2 it's just that good and I can't wait to see it again plus please go in spoiler free it is so worth it there are so many surprises that were deliberately left out of any trailers .",positive

Now I know my title might be arguable to most people but for me and alot of the fans who have been invested in this for the last 10 years, this is no understating the fact that it is the best comicbook/superhero event ever!
And possibly for a long long time we won't be seeing anything close to this.I won't say anything about the movie because i dont want to spoil the Endgame for you!This movie is everything and beyond what we could have expected it to be! it does more than that and it has that satisfying end we all wanted!I write this review today as a proud and emotional fan who is satisfied to see these 10-11 years being paid off!",positive

"This was a very well made movie. They pulled off a good job trying to mash all the characters into the film, and the movie just had to have a huge epic battle in the end. Otherwise, most audiences would instantly hate the movie. They tried to give all the characters something to do like they did in Infinity War, and it worked (yet they had to get rid of Captain Marvel for most of the movie to have this structure somewhat functional, like DC did with Superman in Justice League).
They've established that their time travel is different from other movies, but it still felt inconsistent and confusing. Long story short this just allowed them to shape the story as they needed it without the need to follow basic time travel rules.
Infinity War worked because it was a basic comic book movie with a twist ending nobody expected and an untypical villain. This one was reverted to basics. I knew they were doing time travel, but I thought that they would play this around Thanos and his re-thinking of his decisions from other time parallels. This never happened, even more, his character in the past is much more cliche and uninteresting (also much more stronger than without the gauntlet).
All the drama didn't work for me either. They always put a joke here and there to lighten up the tension and just because most of the characters are basic superheroes who spill one-liners here and there. Thus, all the dramatic moments were sacrificed to stay in-line with the characters.
The epic battle was confusing and felt like the mess they did in Ready Player One, just tons of hours of CGI artists' work. It's just me, but I get bored fast of these things. This is why all the fan service of putting all the characters into the movie didn't work for me. Infinity War had them all grouped and positioned for better understanding, here it's just a mess. But they really couldn't do this otherwise anyway.
I genuinely enjoyed only three moments in this movie, Tony Stark talking to his father in 1970, Thanos seeing the memories from the parallel timeline of his success and his death (which they wasted anyway later making him even more stupid than a basic comic book villain, hence his dialogue), and Cpt. America acting up ""Heil, Hydra"" in the elevator. These were amazing.
Other than that, even fat Thor and the Hulk hating stairs didn't even break a smile on my face (as most of the out of place humor). The theater actually laughed more when Red Skull said ""Welcome, Natasha, daughter of Ivan."" I live in Ukraine and these names are very basic for us, so it just sounded like he'd say ""Welcome, Jenny, daughter of Billy"".
Anyway. I did not feel the satisfaction or the emotion I thought I would. Stark's sacrifice was justified, yet again, the drama in this movie didn't work for me. I didn't feel changed emotionally and for me this means that this movie was unable to touch me in the rights places.",positive
"What a movie. The way the Russo Brothers has brought in the emotions, as well as the action scenes. Brilliant Screenplay, what an acting by all the actors especially, Robert Downey Jr. 3 hrs just flew, I did not get bored in any part, an engaging movie. VFX was great, Marvel has not compromised with its VFX. The best Avengers movie when compared with the other three. A visual treat for all the Marvel fans. Loved it.",positive
"I myself thought that Infinity War was one of the best Marvel movies of all time if not my of my favorite movies of all time, with great Pacing and story writing and the action and suspense was very good. I didn't get that same feeling with Endgame, the pacing was a lot slower and what they did with Thor and Hulk I'm still never going to get over it, giving Thor a gut and making him a joke literally and with Hulk not even throwing a single Damn Punch! How do you have one of the Strongest Comic book characters of all time and have his just sit there and talk?! Overall good movie but not perfect or close it it",positive

"This movie was a great conclusion to the last 11 years of the MCU. You will laugh, you will cheer and you will even cry. This movie takes multiple unexpected turns. When this movie unfolds you surprisingly get to learn more about the characters that survived the Snap. MCU took a different style of storytelling which was very risky for a marvel movie, but they pulled it off. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I strongly recommend that you stay away from as many spoilers as possible. Trust me, the less you know about the movie the more you will love it. Go see it ASAP. I love it 3000.",positive
"End Game is pretty hyped as one of the best movies. And it is a great movie. The directors succeeded in connecting bits and pieces from the past and the present. While making all actors shine and draw the viewer in a hurricane of emotions. But as a result, the movies pacing feels messy, slow, repetitive and fragmented.That doesn't hurt the movie, because it's greatest strength is in the actors, mainly Tony Stark who has the superpower to carry this movie by himself. Further there is the fanservice to include almost every relevant star from the past many movies. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a high octane action movie with compelling fights. Those fights where there, but they were quick, messy, chaotic.This movie's biggest sin is absolutely not that it is a bad movie. It's good, but not as good as Infinity War, and that's a shame. All flaws aside, End Game is an emotional roller coaster, that works as a worthy goodbye to not only some actors, but a complete sage.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame takes place after the grave events of Avengers: Infinity War(2018). The world is in shambles, after Thanos(Josh Brolin) succeeds with his nefarious plan. All the remaining Avengers reunite to stop Thanos, no matter what the consequences.Avengers: Endgame is a mind-blowing film. Directors Anthony Russo & Joe Russo have given us an absolutely satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga, which consists of all 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies which have released, so far. The emotional moments make you shed a tear or two. Don't worry though. The comedic moments are aplenty, as well. The effortless chemistry & the banter among all the Avengers, remains intact. The action set pieces are glorious. The climactic set piece is the highlight of the film. You will cheer till you no longer can, as so many moments will bring you pure & unadulterated joy! The visual effects are brilliant. The 3D is eye-popping. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is incredible as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is unforgettable as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is superb as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Don Cheadle is effective as James Rhodes/War Machine. Paul Rudd is amazing as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Brie Larson is awesome as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Karen Gillan is awe-inspiring as Nebula. Danai Gurira is impressive as Okoye. Bradley Cooper is hysterical as Rocket. Josh Brolin is flawless as Thanos. The supporting cast is scene-stealing in their respective roles. Avengers: Endgame is a must watch. Go & experience this action-packed, hilarious, emotional & wholesomely entertaining rollercoaster ride of a film. My all-time favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie & the best superhero film, of all time. Absolutely jaw-dropping stuff!",positive
Truly the greatest movie I've ever seen. Every single filmmaking aspect is beyond perfect. Reaching this saga climax crates the strongest emotions. The cast & crew give it their all. An achievement that can't be topped.,positive
"There is truly no experience or film like Avengers Endgame. It was 10+ years in the making with payoffs that finally came to fruition. Never have I sat in a movie theater so electrifying.I cried, I cheered, I laughed and I gasped in awe moment after moment. Endgame will forever be the height of any theatrical release. The plot keeps you engaged from the second it starts to the bittersweet ending. I've seen it about 12 times now and it'll never get old. Marvel is at the top of the game and is not slowing down.",positive
"This movie is any thing but best of Avengers series.
Its slow and boring , only the last 30 min of war was good, scenes of iron man and Thanos era was well picturised everything else one can skip.
Time travel is not so easy to explain and its said in the movie itself you cant kill ny one in time travel, then how one character dies , dont want to give spoiler but after that scene I realise this script was not enough research, director should have thought of something but time travel as mean to fight back.
Any ways its well picturised , three main characters are gone so I think now you wont get to see them ny more
Dont expect too much from this movie Infinity war was better",positive

"I have several good reasons why i believe that Marvel made a big mistake...1) In 2012, Loki stole the tesseract. 1 minute later, the Ancient One tells that all the stones have to be returned to the exact place and time. Loki stole the space stone in 2012... Alternative time has been created here at their own universe in 2012. It does not have affect on the future avengers' universe, but for this one in 2012 yes....2) How could Rogers use the lighting? In Thor 3, Odin said to Thor, that the hammer is just to help you concentrate, you have the power. Rogers should not have used the lighting as it is not the hammer which gives the power.... Anyway, the moment was fantastic when Rogers became worthy after what happened in Cap America 3 :)3) How could Thanos came thru the hole with his ship? The key was Stark's machine on their hand to navigate in time finding the proper way to the proper time. Thanos did not have such navigator to find the proper way of time in the hole because the one that 2012 Nebula had, she used to came back with the other avengers to open the hole for Thanos.And those worries are logic related. And i did not tell anything about the ""easy"" solutions such as the rat who accidentally push the exact button which brought back Ant-man and nothing about the ""easy"" jokes which could not correctly balanced out the basic depressing feeling of the movie. The depressing feeling was very good, but the jokes are not ""worthy"" :)",positive
"This movie was an hour and a half too long! The first half of the movie was slow and uninteresting. It did improve as it went along but was unnecessarily long and carried on with so much non sense that was not essential to the plot.
Another example of an over hyped film doing well at the box office because of a big budget and star power. It is marginally better than the last Avengers movie but still mediocrity at its best.",negative
Loved how they closed iron man and cap America's timelines. Thor produced great comic relief. Epic epic epic battle scene at the end and yea a lot of chemistry and touchy feely stuff. Thanks - great series!!!,positive
"Everybody is here, Stan Lee even gets one more cameo. What is interesting is the storytelling and pacing.
While the film is over 3 hours, it really does not seem that long. The opening sequences are not like a typical film of this genre. It starts with a family outing where someone is trying to put mayo on hot dogs. That is the first thing that is amiss.
The film does follow up the previous one in the series. It does not fall into the trap of just reversing the defeat. It slowly goes along developing the process of how to do it, and then twists things into another dimension.
It works magnificently.
This film leaves the mold and yet finishes with a predictable ending, but not the way you'd expect. The real magic is making over 3 hours go by quickly, but the laboring is worth it.
To tell a story well, and develop the characters properly, this film is like a great feast, and the preparations are so complete, that I can only say ""Well Done"".
It would have been easy to lose the viewer with a plot that jumps around in time, but here you can follow time despite that.
It would have been easy to make the ending too violent. Here, it is done just right.
It would have been easy to get too emotional, or not emotional enough. Even that trap is not fallen into. Even the Fox runs well in this one. A must for Marvel fans, and a great end game for Stan Lee.",positive
The best superheroes movie a end of era for marvel was very good,positive
"Everyone went crazy because all the heroes who were snapped came back with there armies to beat thanos' army and ironman got the infinity stones then said ""I am ironman"" and clicked his fingers and all the villians turn into dust,even thanos' but iron sadly died.tears came out of my eyes and now is pepper Potts,happy Hogan and Tony and pepper's daughter and also pepper had her own ironman suit.professor hulk was in the movie and didn't die,Hawkeye got his family back,Thor is fat and he is a team member of the guardians of the galaxy, black widow sacrifice her self to get the soul stone,war machine didn't die, ant Man is with his family and Captain America gave his shield to falcon and went to the 19s to dance with Peggy and that was the end of the movie. The movie is about time travel to get the infinity stones to prevent thanos' snap. R.I.P ironman 2008-2019.never forget this genius play boy.",positive
"End of era.
Worth watching.
There is every thing which is required in a perfect movie. There is drama, action, emotion, every rhiThank you Stan Lee.",positive
"Really really enjoyed watching Endgame.
Captain Marvel is a distant memory. Despite Brie Larson being featured in Endgame it was only in a couple of scenes so it wasn't too bad.
Endgame is incredibly sad, sometimes funny but very entertaining. Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Karen Gillan steal every scene their in.
Will definitely watch again.
Hopefully in phase 4 Captain Marvel will take a back seat just like Endgame.",positive
"First of all,the movie is not the the best movie ever unlike some of the reviews telling here,they are marvel shills,don't listen to them, it is not even the best MCU movie.There are a lot of flaws.First thing to discuss the plot,that is stupid,because if Thanos of 2014 comes in 2023 ,then that Thanos never comes in 2018,because he gets killed,infinity war never happens,so how is this movie even possible.The second thing and that might be a bit personal but the movie was advertised as the conclusions of the arcs of the original avengers,they nailed the Arc of iron man,but falcon is not Steve Rogers,there is just one captain America and he can never be replaced.They did it to team him up with Bucky because there is a series coming out on Disney+.and then thor leaves his throne and gives it to the most idiotic person in Asgard, Valkyrie.She is a drunkard,she doesn't shows any attributes of a ruler.Worst decision ever.And u know the reason they did this to pair him up with guardians,so they set up a gotg sequel,they set up a web series and they forced captain Marvel down the audience throats.She just arrived a month ago and is the most egoistic person of the entire MCU.her each line of dialogue is filled with ego and cringe but the action scenes are dope.And why does Hawkeye sacrifices Natasha,Bruce should do it because she is the most loved person in banner's life,not of hawkeye.the best one is when captain America lifts Mjolnir,the theatre was filled with roars for a couple of minutes.Overall just a good movie with enough flaws that sinks it in front of its much better prequel.",positive
"That was the best movie Marvel i ever seen, everything are brilliant the all actors unbelievable for acting that movie, it deserves any trophy in these years.",positive
"When the plot and storyline is weak, movie makers rrsort to great publicity. This is precisely what Endgame is all about. No fizz just gas.",positive
"Ah, humanity.. if the collective decides that something is good, cool and great, it sees it through tragically twisted perspective.
This time, everyone just seems to fall under the brainwashing hype train of this whole Marvel cinematic universe cultural farce.
Let's just shut our brains off and ignore the absolutlely OVERWHELMING amount of stupidity and shallow, fake pathetics that these plots and heroes present us with.Not me!
I'll say that the Infinity War was actually good, this was far too much of a brain hurting cringefest.",negative
"Objectively, if this movie is produced by any other studio no matter in which country,it won't get a score of 10. But the thing is I can never be rational about MARVEL. Avengers:Endgame indeed give MARVEL's as well as my last 11 years a satisfying ending.This movie is a milestone in the film industry, I doubt if we'll be able to see another movie like this any time sooner, so I really suggest that people,especially MARVEL fans enjoy this movie to the fullest for the highly likely vaccany of this type of film in the next decade or even decades.In Avengers:Endgame, we waved goodbye to some of our favorite chracters and we may never see them in MCU again. But one thing I do know is that the examples these heroes set for us and their spirits will never die, and their successors will bring us more surprises.I will never forget the eleven years in which in grew up with MCU ,and I hope it'll always be with me in the future.
As for MARVEL and all the superheroes that have left us ,love you 3000 times until eternity",positive
"11 years, and 22 movies all lead to this point. This movie was a truly amazing cinematic experience. It had everything a Marvel fan like me needed for the end of a saga. Sure, this wasn't the best MCU movie ever made, but it is definitely in the top 5. Marvel did what they needed to do to please their fans and end a saga 11 years in the making. That included going back in time to older movies, having cameos from past characters, and having a battle at the end that would give a satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga. Another thing this movie did good was the plot. I actually liked the fact that they had to go back in time to the old movies and retrieve the Infinity Stones when they appeared throughout the saga. I also loved the final battle. It was the perfect way to end the saga. It was also not short on time. The times from when the battle started to when the battle ended was around 45ish minutes. It was perfect. The way they ended to story at the end was also amazing and somewhat emotional. Marvel obviously isn't done making movies or shows, but they did need to end the story somehow, and I won't spoil how they did it.In the end, this movie was a perfect way to end the Infinity Saga. I would recommend watching this movie, but everyone basically has already seen it. I am looking foreword to the conclusion of phase three, and the beginning of a new saga with Spider-Man: Far From Home. This movie will always go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time, I am just glad I got to experience it.",positive
"It was an epic, funny & emotional conclusion to the 11 years of the MCU. It's probably one of the most 'comic booky' film next to Spider Verse.",positive
"This movie is well done. The characters each gets their gram. Hulk as a smart emotional fellow, thor as a bum, iron man with his sacrifice.One character however is obsolete. Captain marvell. They should and could do without. She is a arrogant annoying little girl trying too bard to equal a man. She playa tough but doesn't have any weight to cover it.This movie is a 11.. Minus 1 for cap marvell",positive
"Had some really good twists, overall awesome 3 hours!",positive
"This was absolutely a great movie. Marvel seemingly can do no wrong, however this was not without its flaws. Time travel always muddies the waters and this was no different here. We knew there had to be some way to reverse what Thanos accomplished but I personally wish it wouldn't be resorted to time travel. The end result comes with paradoxes; cap fighting cap, even though he thought he was fighting Loki. That would still be a huge problem. I'm also confused about Captain America when he goes back in time and stays back in time to be with the woman he loves. I feel like him not becoming Captain America would alter the development of Shield at the very least. Additionally, the other version of himself would have to be running around at some point? Essentially he was banging his lady behind his own back, right? After giving Sam the shield (which is awesome, I'm all for it) wouldn't the other version of himself ask him, ""where'd you get my shield?"" Time travel was never my jam.Captain America: my biggest issue though was him using Mjollner. Well, not using the hammer but rather the ability to manipulate lightning. The one moment where I feel these writers dropped the ball was this instance. Thor: Ragnarok developed Thor into believing and harnessing the powers within himself. Not even needing the hammer. This allowed Thor to use the powers of lightning by himself. Something I think Cap should not have been able to do because the hammer was not the source of that power. At least, that's the impression I was given. But his shield/hammer combos against Thanos was absolutely awesome. While I would have personally preferred the heroic end for Cap, I also appreciate that he got the peace and love he deserved.Thor: Fat Thor. Much worse has happened to Thor before Thanos came along. His planet was destroyed, his father killed, his brother killed, his mum killed. Losing half of the people in the world seems like it wouldn't have as much impact on him personally. However, I have no qualms about this character development. It was fun.Hulk: I am not a fan of nerd Hulk. Nothing about that was entertaining to me. It lost everything I loved about the character. The constant struggle with himself and inability to control his rage at times. Infinity War developed the character exceptionally well, showing that the rage induced side of Hulk was not infallible and immune to fear. While simultaneously showing that his human side has courage to battle his own doubts. Nerd Hulk was just, boring.Hawkeye and Natasha: I've always liked their relationship. Their scene for the soul stone however, was one of my least favorites of the film. When Thanos threw Gamora over the edge in Infinity War, his sadness was palpable. It was extremely emotional and showed another side of a villain we usually do not get to see. Here we have a silly combat between the two that played out too long. I would have much preferred that whomever was going to jump to their fate would have just knocked the other out in a quick fashion. The other character (Hawkeye I suppose) would see Nat jumping off the edge as it's too late. The drawn out mini battle was too much to make the scene impactful, in my opinion.Ant-Man: I love Paul Rudd and I love the character. His significance was rather downplayed here. He just shows up and has an idea but then he isn't really involved after that. I think Ant-Man should have played a bigger role in creating the solution rather than just presenting the idea.Iron Man: The best part of this film and a worthy send off for the character. I liked everything about him in this movie and I'm not the biggest fan of his stand alone movies. However this was incredibly emotional for him, I love you 3000. My favorite scene was him reuniting briefly with Spider-Man.Spider-Man: He shows up and how can you be displeased with that? He's there but not for very long but his scenes are cool per usual.Captain Marvel: She's there. I honestly forgot she was in the film until she swoops in and destroys Thanos' ship. Meh.Thanos: I am inevitable. He's awesome again. Josh Brolin is the perfect voice for Thanos. I was kind of disappointed in his end but we knew that had to come.The females: I'm all for badass females and there are plenty of them in the MCU but the scene was obvious pandering to the masses. Again, really no harm no foul but it made me chuckle that they all happened to be epically displayed amidst the chaos of battle.The rest show up for the battle as expected and it's awesome to see everyone fighting together again. The entire movie was paced well and I certainly cannot complain about how the movie ended or the journey to get to this moment. Again, I personally prefer Infinity War being the ending...but it is superheroes. The good guys have to come out on top and that is expected so nothing was lost with Endgame. I'm very interested to see where they can take this now. How many times can the world or the universe be in jeopardy and remain interesting? They'll really have to make some lasting impacts (I.e. death of Iron Man, retiring Cap, permanent deaths) otherwise it'll get very dull very fast.Overall, a great Endgame. I hope the time traveling is finished though...",positive
This is an average one time watch.Not at all matching the hype caused due to tremendous success of it's predecessor movies.Average script and below par action sequences.You are better off rewatching GOT.A lot left to be desired out of this.,positive
The Best Marvel Movie Ever... .............................Nuf Said- Stand Lee,positive
"This movie really is what you would call a cinematic event, seeing as it is the culmination of 10 years of storytelling across several movies ( of varying quality). But Endgame doesn't feel as satisfying as Infinity War or as entertaining as Ultron.Seeing this in the theater with a cheering crowd was unlike anything I've experienced as people were crazy hype about this one, but outside of the appeal of crossover between characters the film isn't too entertaining.The three hour runtime is very much felt (especially on rewatch at home) and there are a lot of scenes that just feel like exposition.A decent Marvel film all things considered.",positive
"I give it 3 stars for the huge effort, special effects and good acting. Overall it is a stupid film, bloated with self-importance and sentimentality, with poor pacing. Action scenes did not quite land with me, you know, superheroes throwing and punching stuff, who cares.",negative

"All right, to everyone who says this movie sucks, I have to disagree. It's not supposed to all make sense, because time travel never makes sense. But what I think of this movie is that it's a great close to the MCU. Yes part of me is now wishing they had stopped here. But some of the new projects are good nowadays too.Tony's sacrifice was a great moment. And although Robert Downey Jr. Didn't wanna come back and reshoot the end and say ""I am Iron Man,"" it makes a great closing for the whole MCU. End it with the line that started it all.",positive
It was a good movie but there just too much hype surrounding it. I'm giving it 10 stars because of the cast.,positive
This movie have fantastic effects and I love its music.,positive
"I saw this last week and I was very impressed with the film, The only negative or negatives I have with it was that Thanos was not as important here as he was in the last film where he was a bad MF destined to wipe out humanity, Our heroes tried and tried to kill him and he successfully got all 6 stones wiping out half of the population and you could really feel like he won.Here he is quickly killed in the beginning and the film then moves to a time travel aspect which liked but it was waayy to complicated to follow at times. I feel like the time that it took up could have been used for the end fight scene which was amazing but it was far far too short compared with Infinity WarEndgame whilst a good movie let me down with the likes of Thor and Hulk that were being held back to a comedic role which I hated!The Last battle was good but to me tried too hard to incorporate every single hero from the previous films just to get them on the screen, The battle length was also too short compared with Infinity War which still holds up to me as the best film in the series.A good film yes but not better than Infinity War IMO",positive
"Forget people who say that this movie is crap,because the way I see it avengers endgame is the most entertaining movie in history so far.",positive
"He's right. Basically everything he wrote above. The movie was entertaining and well worth the time, but it doesn't deserve
a rating higher than decent.And oh.. don't pay for it. Free stream it. NEVER support the greedy milking ****s at Disney corp.",positive
"I didn't find this movie all that interesting. I felt it was about as good as Infinity Wars. This film feels like a complete ripoff of the last episode of Star Trek Voyager that was also called Endgame and also involved time travel. I don't mind when time travel is used in a movie or tv show as long as it makes some sense and somewhat consistent within the universe and doesn't leave giant gaping holes everywhere. This movie failed hard with the time travel stuff. I don't recall time travel being an aspect in the MCU, so whipping out the good old time travel trope randomly required way too much suspension of disbelief for me.The fact that Tony Stark created a time machine overnight just blew my mind that someone actually thought it was a good idea to put it in the movie. The Professor Hulk stuff mind numbingly ridiculous. I'm confused as to why it was decided that Banner would just be Professor Hulk for this movie. It didn't add anything to the movie and made his character boring. Alcoholic, overweight comedic relief Thor destroyed Thor's character. It's not really even explained why he turned into an alcoholic bum. He decapitates Thanos within the first 5 minutes of the movie and the next time we see him, he's an alcoholic raging over video games. Honestly, nothing is really explained in this 3 hour movie. The directors thought it was best to like 90 minutes that added zilch to the filmThe time travel in the film renders all the other films in the MCU as pointless. There are no consequences for anyone's actions. The Avengers failed in Infinity War, but good thing Tony Stark created a time machine to fix past failures. Paradoxes be damned and the ""rules"" of time travel can just be changed at anytime as this movie did.The thing at the end with Captain America putting back all the stones in their original time line didn't make sense as how he'd be able to even do that. The movie couldn't be bothered to show him doing that either. Him going back to 1940 to be with Peggy Carter doesn't make sense either and messes up his character. Did he just sit and watch all this bad stuff happen throughout the years? Why didn't it create an alternate universe?Just all around dull movie. It would've been better if the Avengers traveled to an alternate universe to get the stones instead of time travel. Then there wouldn't have been as many gaping holes in this film. It doesn't seem like Infinity Wars and Endgame were thought through.",negative
"To incredible fanfare and hype, ""Avengers: Endgame"" has arrived. I am happy to say that the film most definitely lives up to expectations, and offers audiences a thrilling, emotionally stirring, and incredibly satisfying finale to the Avengers saga. While it's not completely perfect, it's undoubtedly a great film and far superior to last year's ""Avengers: Infinity War."" While I know that many people loved ""Infinity War,"" I dissented from them due to the excess of ""filler"" in the narrative that made the film seem simultaneously overstuffed and not completely satisfying--with the exception of the film's ending, which was one of the biggest cliffhangers in modern film history.The film picks up as the stakes from the shocking ending of ""Infinity War"" are a clear reality. and the Avengers must figure out how to defeat Thanos. I'm not going to say much else regarding the plot, but what I will say is that the film's emotional core relative to other comic book films is what truly elevates it. The action scenes are no longer just entertaining action scenes, but battles with real characters that audiences truly care about and have gone on a journey with for many films and many years now. This emotional core is enhanced by the film's score and cinematography, which are both generally understated yet also beautifully impactful at the same time. The film is consistently entertaining and paced incredibly well, and never drags despite its 181-minute runtime. There are plenty of twists and turns that even many serious fans probably won't be expecting, as the Russos do a great job with trying to subvert audience expectations. The performances are all great, and much of the cast has grown and changed quite a bit from their earlier days in MCU movies. This film is less action-focused than ""Infinity War,"" and that works to its benefit since so many important plot points are generally emphasized over action. Make no mistake, the action (and especially the climax) is excellent in this film when it happens. But ""Avengers: Endgame"" shows us that there is even more to Marvel films than those moments, no matter how thrilling and entertaining they may be. Despite its relatively minor flaws (some inconsistencies and fallacies in its narrative structure,) it's a truly fascinating exercise in watching all of the puzzle pieces of the MCU be put together, and it will be interesting to see where Marvel movies go from this point. 8.5/10Note: I saw this film in Dolby Cinema. The picture and sound quality were generally strong, but this was not one of the best Dolby presentations I have come across.",positive
Conflict of powerhouses. As good as Infinity Wars.,positive
"In arguably the most anticipated movie of the year and one of the most anticipated movies of all time, Avengers: Endgame was well on its way with all the hype leading up to the film. Having enjoyed Infinity War but thought it could have been better all around, the overall hype for Endgame had its match made. Now having watching this film in theaters as it was a must watch to (due to the 3D experience and also knowing the longer one waited, the more likely spoilers would have been exposed, ruining the experience and essence of the film).As a film, won't say much but this film delivers on expectations. Had no knowledge of the overall plot but within the first few minutes, one was excited and was there for the thrill of the ride throughout. With a runtime of over three hours (including end credits), the film has a great pace and doesn't feel nearly as long (which is great since something is always happening). Due to its great cast and plethora of characters, there really is never a dull moments and the film is ensured and filled with moments of surprise, suspense, action emotion and overall greatness.Now the overall plot of time travel was well done and brought back many memories to the other Avenger films. The wait for the film was most definitely worth it, and this film will most doubly become one of the biggest movies of alltime. Will need to see this film probably once more in theaters before its run is over and most definitely will see it again multiple times afterwards to soak in its greatness. Avengers: Endgame is more than a movie, it's a moment - a moment in time. Cherish every moment.",positive
"Magnificent, thank you for everything Tony and Cap.",positive
"Eleven-year wait is finally over. The Endgame hit theatres on April 24th, and the word ""hit"" might be the best way to put it. The culmination of a comic-book phenomenon called ""The Avengers"" is set to become the most successful film in terms of box-office gross, as well as be generally regarded as the best comic-book movie ever made.The story takes place in the so-called MCU, a universe where all the superheroes reside. Established 11 years ago with the release of the first film, The Iron Man, at that time tricky move has proven to be a resounding success and changed the lives of everyone involved. Marvel managed to build a universe so mesmerizing it has made fans always coming back for more. With the last film closing the chapter, it was Marvel's responsibility to do justice to this franchise. And it seems that they didn't disappoint.The film plays on a sentimental note, leaving viewers with a nostalgic feeling. This is done by referencing to the past movies, and even revisiting the old sets. Slightly less action-packed than the former Infinity War, The Endgame focuses on the journey of the original Avengers, but still, or perhaps because of this, manages to take many surprising turns. It is nothing new that the stories of some of these characters are coming to an end, but don't make this prevent you from going to see this film! The death sequences are dealt with graciously, avoiding overused clichés. They leave you feeling heart-broken, but also satisfied with the epic conclusion.The only think that I find to be irritating was the song repertoire. Although the songs usually fit the scenes in which they appeared, they didn't tie the story together, making it a little chaotic and inconsistent.All in all, The Endgame is an achievement in both, cinematography and storytelling, and is a must-see for every cinephile.",positive
"The movie picks up faster than Infinity War, and the third act is one of the best moments in cinematic history!",positive
"I've been a superhero and comic fan since I was little and have enjoyed watching the entire cinematic Marvel Universe take shape. While there have been some excellent films and in my opinion some average films, the culmination was the amazing Infinity War. Infinity War delivered on nearly all fronts while I must say that Avengers: Endgame did not. Infinity War captured my undivided attention for its entire 2 hour and 40 minute run time with its mostly serious tone regarding the fate of Earth and its people. The same cannot be said for Endgame as it seemed to jump around often and mixed in a bit too much humor. The movie runs 3 hours and 2 hours of it are a convoluted story about the heroes troubles after the 'snap' and figuring out a plan to defeat Thanos while bringing back all of those lost. The last 45 minutes or so have a very good battle sequence with a mish mash of conclusions. The film focuses too much on fan service instead of creating a cohesive storyline. Spoilers below for a more in depth look at what worked and what didn't.***************************Spoilers Below**************************Best moments in the film:
The last 45 minutes overshadow the entire film and are by far and away the best part.
Heartfelt moments between Iron Man and Spider Man.
Captain Marvel trying to pull off the gauntlet and Thanos moving the power stone to the other hand to get him off of her looked amazing.
The nod from Doctor Strange to Iron Man knowing what the outcome would be was a fitting end.
A fine farewell for RDJ/Iron Man in the end considering Iron Man started the MCU.
Some of the humor from early on especially from Professor Hulk.
Good scene in having Cap turn over his shield to Falcon so that he can become the Next Captain America as he has done so in the comics.Negatives:
How often did time travel need to be discussed and tested? The entire plot revolving around this seemed awfully complicated and confusing. The first 2 hours were dreadfully slow and a bit unnecessary towards the overall arc of the movie.
Most characters barely played a role or had an impact in the movie. Yes they were around and popped up but most didn't do much of anything. I believe fans are more excited that they got to see everyone on the screen at the same time instead of realizing how little they contributed to the movie.
Black Widows death was not that impactful and is strange considering the talks of her potential solo movie.
Captain Marvel was definitely too over powered in the film.
Thor is now fat and it's hilarious to talk about his weight gain....talk about use of childish humor.
Seeing Professor Hulk was a treat but he was rather underutilized. He had a few funny moments in the film but he was rather insignificant in the battle once again due to a certain handicap. In Infinity War he refused to come out and now he was injured. A little weak for being such a huge part of the team.
Captain America wielding Thor's hammer and also harnessing the power of lightning? Yes I know Cap picks up the hammer and throws it in the comics but seeing him swing around the hammer and shoot lightning felt a little silly.
Speaking on the end battle, Thanos generals were also insignificant in the battle when they played key roles in fighting the Avengers.
Was Captain America's love story really that important to end the franchise on that note?",positive
"It's Really exceeded expectations, everything was beautiful and there were really beautiful shots that moved my feelings a lot,, I grieved for Tony Stark who deserves better😞Thanos, his character build is bad, not terrifying, nor cool, nor prestige, just bad.",positive
"The movie is fun and entertaining overall. But it is supposed to tie up all the loose ends of the previous films of this franchise, which contradicts with a lot of plots
of this particular film. Maybe we should just turn a blind eye and give it a pass because this ending can't be more epic or whatever, but this is the one movie we've waited for so long for me to say like, that's such a great way to tie it up and all. Because it's not. There are so many inconsistencies and cringy moments in this movie. And it doesn't give me the feeling of Infinity War or Cival War. The level of conflict is just not there. So to sum it up, it is kinda enjoyable as a comedy, but I'm personally not satisfied in a whole bunch of ways.",positive
"Most cringe worthy superhero movie I've seen.
I was eye-rolling most of the time. Near the end I was just hoping for it to finally end.
I mean, where to begin, is totally messy and nonsensical! All the time travel doesn't make sense at all.
After all the hype I'm so mad at how bad it was.",negative
"It was really beyond my thoughts, it has all the emotions in this movie. It has a lot of sadness from the beginning and it was very funny also, a very great action which was an epic one and adventurous too,
It has really touched my heart, prepare for it because there's lot of sorrows, pain, comedy, shocking moments and it was worth of crying a lot. When I was watching this, it gave a lots of goosebumps too most of the time and every part of the movie, very minute was special and precious. Please enjoy the movie to the fullest of your life. For me it's the greatest film of all time and for me. There will be some moments where you will be like freezing and and trembling too. So thank you and once again for the epic word, ""Whatever it takes"". Glory to the Avengers and may it be the one and only that nobody can break its record.I'M SHOCKED..
I'M SILENT..
I'M STUNNED..
AND WHAT NOT..I ENJOYED,I LAUGHED I CHEERED AT FIRST,
BUT THEN I STOPPED REACTING..
STOPPED LAUGHING AT JOKES..THANOS LITERALLY WIPED OUT AVENGERS SAGA..AS YOU GROW UP..YOU HAVE TO LET GO YOUR TOYS..YOUR MEMORIES AND HAVE TO MOVE ON BY KEEPING YOUR HEART HARD. THIS FEELS SAME, YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON WITHOUT AVENGERS, WHO MADE US BEILEVE IN SUPERHEROES IN THESE TEN YEARS..END OF AN ERA..END OF I LOVE YOU 3000WE ARE IN THE ENDGAME NOW..",positive
It's truly the end of the Infinity Stones Saga and it felt like as tears where pouring out of my eyes at the last scenes. Everything was tied up and perfect. It was brilliant. The movie itself was a roller coaster of emotions. Everyone was cheering and then crying on the next scene. It was crazy. But it was full of love and humane. It was everything it needed to be.,positive
"The movie is a masterpiece, even that the first and second act are very slow, the movie catches you and makes you wait for the third act to arrive, and my man when it arrives... you hit the palm of such incredible that it is. And it ends with mastery, giving an epic end to a great circle that began in 2008. I recommend this movie to all who are fans of superheroes. Congratulations MARVEL, you got it.",positive
"This film is hard to talk about without spoiling it, it is a 3 hour movie and the furthest I'll go in terms of talking about what is in the movie, is to say that we have seen nothing of it from the trailers. The movie is very heartfelt, and that's performed by the excellent character development. Throughout the years of the MCU, you feel like you know these characters, but not that personally, and this film definitely fills the missing gap there. We actually get to see these characters not fighting, doing things many of us wouldn't imagine and it makes these guys we have seen on the big screen for the past 11 years so much more lovable. This movie is also truly ror the fans, coming into this movie with not much knowledge about Marvel wouldn't make you feel the same way of the movie that a fan would in terms of understanding and emotions. Avengers: Endgame is pieced together masterfully, by the Russo Brothers, who I must acknowledge for directing a movie like this. They did an excellent job with pacing, plot and keeping the whole 3 hours completely discrete and unpredictable. This movie very much feels like a culmination of what the past 11 years, and 22 movies in the MCU have lead up to. The final act is absolutely astounding, and really shows you what the MCU has come to, being one of my favourite scenes from not only all of the MCU but also that I've ever seen. Make sure not to miss a single minute of this movie, with all of it being important. This movie was so close to being perfect, making the right choices, bringing an emotional tone we've never had before and so much more that worked, but there were a few tiny problems. Firstly, CGI seems a little bit off in some or the scenes, which is a bit disappointing but minor enough to the point that no casual watcher would notice. Second, some of their jokes just don't land, especially in one scene at the very end. Third, it feels like it could be a bit shorter, with some scenes in the second half that didn't really matter. Overall, this movie is astounding, but only for Marvel fans. The 3 hours doesn't feel that long whatsoever, maybe feeling a bit long towards the end, but the movie keeps to be very entertaining all the way throughout. Avengers: Endgame is the best representation of Marvel as a whole, and is easily the best MCU movie yet, with Captain America: Civil War right below it. There are many theories online, and I'm aware of most of them, I can confirm that nearly all of them aren't even close or barely play a part in the movie. It definetely will hold up as the best movie of 2019, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the MCU. Keep in mind, there's no after credits, it doesn't matter how long you stay. Besides, the very final scene itself feels like an after credits scene.",positive
There are so many ways that the movie could have gone. But it is chosen to be this way. So the climax should not be criticised. The story is completed with no proper explanation for the rest of the avengers. Other avengers are not given importance in most of the places. Don't go to the movie if you know the spoilers. My experience has been spoiled by my friends.,positive
"Avengers: Endgame marks the end of the Infinity Saga, and is the perfect conclusion! This movie takes place directly after the events of Infinity War, at which point the remaining heroes fly to Thanos's retirement home and End his Game. But Thanos had used the Infinity Stones again to destroy the Stones! Five years later, the heroes have come to accept that half of the world's population has been wiped out, when Ant-Man suddenly re-emerges from the Quantum Realm with a cure to the Blip: Time Travel! Iron Man reunites the remaining heroes: Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Professor Hulk (who managed to become a combo of Hulk and Banner), Bro Thor (who got fat and suffers from Post-Thanos Stress Disorder), Rocket and Nebula, War Machine, and Ant-Man to go through time to grab the Stones and bring the dusted back to life, revisiting multiple movies from the past and bring the MCU timeline together in a satisfying way. Things go wrong when Thanos of 2014 intercepts 2023 Nebula and finds his way into 2023 to try one more time to get the Stones, with plans to destroy the entire universe and rebuild it in his image. Cue the most awesome final battle in cinema history with EVERY hero (even Howard the Duck is there!) This movie may be three hours long but it doesn't feel like it at all! It's split really nicely into three acts: the aftermath of the Snap, the Time Heist, and the Finale against Thanos. This movie balances comedy, action, emotional story, and visual effects so nicely, along with another great Alan Silvestri soundtrack (the music at the funeral was too much for everyone's emotions, let's be honest!)While this movie may have a few plot holes that come naturally when you do time travel movies (looking at you, old man Cap), the movie is highly enjoyable and easily equals Infinity War as a 10/10 movie. If only Marvel could make movies like this again. Roll on, Secret Wars!",positive
"After a long time, watched a movie with high expectations. They were high not coz of marketing, but this finale had all the contents to make a masterpiece.
Unfortunately one thing was missing and that was the story line. First two hours were long and boring. You can not make a movie by revisiting all old stuff again and that too in single movie.
Time travel movies ain't meant to be actions ones with superheros playing saviours.
When. You intent to make time travel stories, you should take some lessons from back to the future series.
Back to the future series have been best coz it dealt with one. Good story line.In infinity stones, for time travel events marvel never laid any stress on repercussion , also marvel. Made fun of hulks character. People would have loved to watch hulk bashing thanos to some extent.instead he was made a wuss.Same thing happened with thor in endgame. One more superhero character degraded to pathetic levels.30 min fight scenes at the end are. Moment of glory.. Still it can't be matched with infinity stones as they have much better locations in last part rather than dull battle field in this one.In nut shell, a golden moment to create a great masterpiece has gone down the drains",positive
"Avengers Endgame is the best MCU movie ever.
It truly justifies the end of Infinity Saga",positive
"I am with MCU since day one. Huge fan. Watched everything multiple times. And I'm disappointed. I left cinema mad at myself for how much I dislike it. It was familiar feeling for me. I've felt the same after AoU. It was too long, sometimes pretty boring. But come on! They nailed professor Hulk, Cap whispering Hail Hydra, Ant-Man being Ant-Man, coolest decapitation scene in PG13 history. It was like 3 different movies mashed up into one. Endgame feel overcooked and could be way better. I mean Tony's death was totally unnescessary kinda like Pietro's. He should die in battle not by suicide. And Carol Danvers is so terrible I can't bare looking at her cocky face, total miscast and we are gonna live for I don't know how many movies with her, Gal Gadot is the superhero all young women should look up to. To sum up my first review 'cause I feel like MC Gets Side-Tracked Easily, I need to say that it could be a lot better.",positive
"More than 3h of ""yes sure..."" BS. The franchise is at its end and CGI won't rescue it.",negative
"It has a extremely solid and VERY well-built plot, packed tight with action, tension, and also manages give everyone a moment and provide a very emotional experience.
And despite claims, the use of time-travel does NOT hinder or botch the plot one bit! In fact, it is the ONLY way that they could fix the problem.
And the emotional experience is very moving and authentic. I don't know why some people are upset with the Avengers being depressed after the Snap - they witnessed people being turned to dust right before their eyes; several of them being loved ones and dear friends).
And they couldn't do a thing about it.
Imagine for a second that you were one of the lucky people to have survived the Snap (that's a even 50/50 chance of you either living or dying) but all your family, most of your friends (if not all) dying around you and you were SO close to preventing it and then try and tell me that being depressed and struggling to move on is wrong and annoying. Cause until you experience that for yourself, you have no idea what it would be like and the proper time for grieving to be over and no right to accuse them of such things.
Especially with Thor. As a person who suffered from a 7-year-long depression, I can assure you that the depiction of Thor and the others grieving for all these years is completely realistic and very authentic.
I appreciated the humour - it prevented it from being overly depressing, and, like Infinity War, Endgame has the perfect blend of humour and seriousness.
And the climax! The movie is three hours long, and the climax starts around the beginning of the third hour, so there were some concerns about it dragging, but it doesn't. The final hour is tight with action, tension, emotional weight, and makes it a TRULY epic finale and the best cinematic experience ever!
The movie itself doesn't drag, it all flows smoothly, and you don't notice the time length as the story totally captures your whole attention.
And with regards to that fighting scene with the girls, it didn't bother me. In fact, I found it a hilarious and fun action scene. There are those who hate that scene for no guys being there, but may I point out that early on in the climatic fight, a few of the guys (and ONLY the guys) gang up on Thanos and fight him. Now, if I was to criticize this scene because it was only the guys and no girls at that point and call it cringy, you would probably say that I was being stupid and sexist. And you'd be right. The same applies to those who hate that girl-fight scene because there were no guys. Plus, what is unrealistic about? Why can't that happen, like the scene with the guys vs. Thanos earlier?
And with regards to the Soul Stone scene, Nebula not telling them about the price to gain the Soul Stone is not a plot hole. She didn't know - neither did Thanos and Gamora when they went there in Infinity War as you can see Gamora's and Thanos' shock at hearing the price for the Stone. Nebula wouldn't know simply because Gamora didn't come back - she simply thought that Thanos had murdered her in cold-blood and for being a turncoat, which isn't out of character for him. Also, what's wrong with sending Clint and Natasha, the two Avengers with no superpowers, to get it instead of two with superpowers? Their superpowers would have made absolutely no difference - they still would have had to have paid the same price as Natasha and Clint. It makes no difference.
And how can I write a review without talking about Thanos? He is one of the most formidable MCU villains (alongside the Dark Elves and Peter's dad) and I was surprised to see how strongly he believed in what he was doing - which was great, from a purely cinematic point of view, as it makes the story more intense and makes you really hate the villain, as well you should. Josh Brolin is perfect for his role and totally captures him. An excellent actor and scary villain.
An extremely well-done movie that perfectly concludes the Infinity Saga with a bow.",positive
I am speechless after watching this movie. Still having problem processing my thoughts after watching this movie. Some big changes were made and it will be very unacceptable to many hardcore MCU fans but everything must come to an end. The best ending to a decade of movie journey and end to an epic saga. Kudos to Russo brothers for gifting viewers this epic conclusion.,positive
"Being a marvel fan, I've had the best experience of my life watching this movie, what a movie❤❤",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is the final film to the Infinity saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story is emotional, unpredictable, unforgettable, complex and intense. The story does continue on right after infinity war had finsihed, and I thought it was a good way too start because the characters can give you an understanding of how they are feeling. How much loss they have witnessed.
During the three hour film, you care so much for the characters that it makes you want them to live through the whole time, leaving with no casualties. The acting by the cast is outstanding, none of their lines sounded cheesy. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr especially. The audience has never seen the two characters shine so bright and powerful over the last 11 years. The visuals are the most impressive, it is shown to be Oscar worthy and you would be hungry for more as the film continues on. The final battle was the bomb, the mother of all battles, better then Ready Player One's finale. It's so big and all of it fits in perfectly. Avengers Endgame is the perfect finale that has been set up over the last 11 years. Its a rewatchable film and you will never see the characters the same way as you have seen them from the past films.",positive
"BEFORE YOU READ- SPOILERS BELOW
Ok. So it starts out with Hawkeye's family getting dusted (and he doesn't even notice it). Then it shows Tony and Nebula stuck on the guardians ship. Tony is about to die of hunger, thirst, oxygen. Until Captain Marvel shows up and brings her to the Avengers HQ. They talk about what happened when they were fighting Thanos, making fun of Rocket because he's a raccoon. Then they all go to where Thanos is at. (It's literally some random planet). Then they find Thanos, and he tells the Avengers that he used all six stones to get rid of the stones. Then Thor literally DECAPATATES THANOS!! So then we get a time jump of five years. Tony has a daughter, Ant-Man gets out of the quantum realm, and Thor is fat and drunk as heck. Turns out, Korg, Meek, and Valkyrie survived. Ant-Man mentions to Steve that he can use the quantum realm to time travel. No one believes it at first, but Tony finds a way too. So then Black Widow goes to Japan to track down Hawkeye. He volunteers to be one of the first people to time travel in this movie. So then everyone goes back in time to get all six stones (at different times). We see the ending of Avengers 1, Tony bumps into his father in the 70's and 2014 Thanos finds out about the time travel stuff (because of Nebula's memory files) They do eventually get all the stones and snap their fingers to make half the universe come back. It happens, but 2014 Thanos attacks the Avengers. Then Captain America picks up Thor's hammer, Doctor Strange calls every dead character to fight Thanos (and his army). Tony snaps his fingers and he wipes out Thanos and his army. He eventually dies from the overpower of the stones. (There's actually something I forgot, Black Widow gives herself up in order to get the soul stone). So then we see Tony's funeral. Literally everyone is there. Captain America goes back in time to put the stones where they originally belonged, but he does that and he stayed in the past. We see him really really old. He just wanted to be with Peggy. The End. There is no post/end credits scene.",positive
"An epic finish of The Infinity Saga. Great movie, great story, emotional movie etc. Congratulations to all Cast & Crew you guys did a great job and specially to Robet Downey Jr. Mr Kevin Fiege and The Russo Brothers you guys are the best!",positive
This was a great movie but Thanos just battling everyone without the stones and somehow winning just annoyed me.,positive
This was an incredible ending to the Avengers saga. Plenty of story and action. An emotional roller coaster at times. The Avengers franchise has been the best superhero portrayal yet.,positive
"It takes some time to get going. Then there is this obsession to try to be funny, that is sometimes a bit annoying. The Final Battle is way to overloaded and that not very subtile feministic scene at the end of the battle is kind of pathetic (you will get what I mean, when you see it). I love female superheros, but that particular scene doesn't make sense at all. Please stop ruining good movies, with political statements.
It's worth a watch, no doubt, but I was kind of disappointed. Its way to melodramatic for a freaking superheromovie.",positive
"Where to begin. 30 mins in I got an uneasy feeling. An hour in something felt very wrong. Two hours in I was in shock. This film is a bloated, BORING, convoluted slog of time travel utter nonsense. The positive reviews of this film have me convinced that professional reviewers, pod-casters and tv/youtube talking heads are being paid for favorable reviews. I'd hate to sound like a conspiracy minded person but...
During the 3 hours in a sold-out theatre I barley heard a chuckle as most of the jokes fell flat, rare for a marvel movie. The end garnered no applause, also rare for an event movie like this. So many characters are minimized or just poorly written. For the record I loved Infinity War. I thought I was walking in to the greatest comic book super hero movie ever and I could not be more disappointed.",negative
"I watched this film yesterday and am still talking about how good it is - I laughed alot, I cried even more... I cannot understand how it got any less than a 9 in the user reviews. Absolutely stunning, beautiful end to a longggg series.",positive
"This movie was genious for some reason,less action i know.but at the end this movie was a masterpiece on many ways,ill be waiting for more marvel movies for now.",positive
"I went in to Avengers: Endgame with high expectations and they were still shattered.First off, nobody is ready for the 3 hours that conclude the Infinity Saga and if you think you are then you're wrong. This is easily the best MCU movie so far and one of the best superhero movies of all time. The visuals are stunning and the cast and crew goes all out to give us the cinematic event of a lifetime.The movie features a strong and engaging plot with directors Anthony and Joe Russo clearly showing us that they know what they're doing. Character arcs across the board come to a satisfying conclusion and just remind us why we, as fans, have invested this much in these films the past 11 years.Bring your tissues, because this is without a doubt the most emotional adventure that Marvel has put us on as an audience. Emotional scenes are backed up by Alan Silvestri's stunningly beautiful and goosebump-inducing soundtrack, with many callbacks to previous MCU movies that prove that this is a worthy conclusion.Incredibly astounding and emotionally affecting end to a saga that started with a billionaire in a cave with a box of scraps and a scrawny kid from Brooklyn who just wanted to do the right thing.Go see this film; you will not regret it at all.",positive
It's the end of the story and the superhero. The old story is over and the new one is about to start. Let's take a few more steps on the path of memory. Old friends meet again. People who want to be superheroes become real superheroes. Lost time is also picked up in another parallel universe. There is no better ending.,positive
I went into this movie fully expecting that it can't top infinity war and I was mostly right but it was still a great movie and had an amazing climax and a way to end the series.,positive
"No spoilers here , I won't write anything , I just wanted to share that this movie is one of the best movies of a lifetime that you can watch now. Go watch it !!!",positive
"Reason why I am not disappointed by this movie is because I wasn't expecting much from it in a first place.Infinity war was 'perfectly balanced': action scenes, motivation of characters, humor. Endgame wants to be the same movie, but it simply cannot reach that level.Things I liked:
Humor level is pretty good. It's not overwhelming and there is enough.
Visuals - obviously, action scenes... as well as everything else looks amazing.
Feeling of nostalgia - can't deny, there are tons of references you will find at this movie and it feels amazing to spot every small detail of this universe. (Not gonna work, if you haven't watched majority of marvel movies).Things I am neutral about:
Time travel: the very moment characters started to talk about time travel, I had a bad feeling. Ironically, they even inserted jokes about time travel movies and ultimate phrase: ""It's not how time travel works"".
After Thanos stated that he ""shred stones to atoms"" I was expecting they will just use quantum realm to restore the stones without time-travel stuff. However, at the same time it would neglect huge part of Nostalgia, so I'm undecided on this. The major hole of time travel I noticed is ending with old Steve, who spent his life in another timeline (if I understood correctly) and somehow ended up on the bench in the original timeline without using a machine.Things I disliked:
Pace of the movie: It starts really slow, almost boring. And when the main story actually starts to be interesting and intense (which is after 75% of the movie), there is simply no place to insert character interactions I would like to see. Most of the characters, who died in IW has like 5-30 seconds of screen time and only few of them even says a word.To sum up, Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie, but it's also not terrible.
Experience from it is truly individual.
If you weren't following marvel movies story-line and characters, or you feel indifferent to them - it will be just an average marvel movie with full bag of stereotypes you love/hate.
In case you liked all previous movies, this - will be no exception.",positive
An experience you'll gonna remember forever and watch again and again.,positive
"There are already a surfeit of general reviews for this movie, so I am going to focus on the central conceit of the plot - time travel - and the way it is handled.The time travel device is flagged with the tongue firmly in the cheek, as the characters break the fourth wall to share jokes with the audience about how all our time travel knowledge comes from... movies. Therefore it is not knowledge at all, and we can freely revolutionize our sense of time travel on the fly. Yay!So the old logic of time travel - that you change and endanger the present by messing with the past in any way - is done away with. And a new logic of time travel is introduced: now changing the past in no way affects the present, instead just creating new parallel timelines. Or, to put it as the Avengers' writers do, the 'past' that I visit is actually in my future. It is not even really happening in the past...(?)Thus, to use (and modify appropriately) the old Back To The Future premise, if I go back and tell my past self the outcome of a bunch of sporting events and advise making a bet or two, I will not be one penny richer when I get back to the present, because that is not really my past self. It is my past self from another timeline, one who got rich using a list of sporting results from the future. Get it?I must say that when Avengers:Endgame proposed this premise I was initially very happy with it. Honestly, it makes a hell of a lot more sense than the normal time travel logic, for one simple reason: if there is only one timeline (as in most time travel movies), time traveling to the past and changing it is highly likely to prevent the time travel taking place, certainly in the way that it did in the initial, non-past-changed version of the present.So for instance, if I go back and kill Thanos as a child (as Ant-Man suggests), he never gets the stones, I am never prompted to time travel by him killing half the universe, and the time travel never happens, so who exactly went back to kill Thanos? Certainly not the version of me in the present in which Thanos is dead! When you think about it, there MUST be two timelines: one where Thanos had the stones and, in desperation, I went back in time and killed him; and another where I was chillin', because I never heard of Thanos, because he was dead. Simple, right?Why, then, I hear you cry, did most if not all previous time travel movies not notice and obey the clearly superior logic of time travel - namely that changing the past cannot affect the present - followed by Avengers:Endgame?The answer is fiendishly simple: If time travel creates alternate timelines rather than changing the present, it also creates no possibilities for dramatic jeopardy, because nothing I do in the past makes much difference. And this is true not just for the present, but also for the past. Are you with me? Allow me to explain...Say I go back to the past - not far in the past, just five minutes - and empty my own wallet, which is on the kitchen table (let's say it contains a 20 pound note). I now return to the future with 20 quid in my hand, but when I go to the kitchen and look in my wallet, guess what? The money is still there! I now have forty quid in total, the only caveat being that the two notes have the exact same serial number. Notice how this is a totally zero-sum game. There is only 20 pound for each version of reality, and if one has an extra one, another must be missing one.But suddenly, I feel bad about robbing my past/alternate self of his 20 pound, and decide to go back again, to four minutes in the past, and give my self back the money. But when I get there, guess what? I cannot do it! Because I am going back to my own version of four minutes ago, in which I never lost the 20 quid. All I can do is create a third timeline, which was visited by a friendly version of future me handing out money, in addition to the second timeline which was visited a by a greedy version of future me taking money. (now a three-way zero-sum game)To put it another way. If changing things five minutes ago does not change the present, then it also does not change any point between five minutes ago and the present.Let's take another scenario. I make up a codeword, and then go back to five minutes ago and tell my past self (call him me2) that word, before returning to the present. Once I get back to the present, I can never visit me2 again, because he is no longer in my past. In my past I made up the word just now, but he was told the word five minutes ago by his future self.So if I go back in time and borrow something (an Infinity Stone for instance) I cannot give it back, ever. Because when I next visit the past, it will be my past, not the slightly funky alternative past I spawned last time by borrowing an Infinity Stone.Thus, when Hulk promised the Ancient One that he would be right back with her stone, she would have calmly explained that this was not possible, because by merely appearing in her reality he had forked it off from his own, and the version of the past he returned to next time would feature a new her, complete with stone, and with no memory of meeting him.In other words, if changing the past does not change the present, then the past resets itself every time I travel back in time. In every way.The problem (from dramatic perspective) is, this makes the past a very boring place. I can go back and kill someone (even myself) a million times, but every time I come back they will be alive and well, totally clueless about the many deaths they have suffered at my hands. It also almost makes the present like a computer game cheat mode, because I can double my resources anytime by just going back one minute and robbing myself!The movie tried to get around this by making time travel dependent on a finite number of Pym particles, but the exact same logic applies here. You can go back five minutes and rob yourself of all your Pym particles as many times as you like. Sure those timelines are now not going to be able to stop Thanos, but ultimately, what does it matter? There are already, according to this logic of time travel, infinite timelines where Thanos wins, and infinite timelines where Thanos loses, and none of them matter to you at all. Maybe those suckers you robbed in the past are better off without their Pym particles? You will never know or have any way of finding out.Clearly this logic of time travel, whilst certainly theoretically appealing, creates levels of silliness that no ordinary film could hope to cope with. I needn't bother revisiting the specific instances but suffice to say that the movie was forced to throw its own time travel logic out of the window almost before it had been elaborated by Banner in the early discussions, and continued to throw it out the window to the bitter end(game).There is one possible answer to this, which the more generous devotees might propose. Perhaps Banner is wrong about the past not affecting the future, but either doesn't know it or doesn't want to tell the others because the implications are too crazy to think about. Sadly this makes no sense on many levels, for instance because Tony Stark would clearly have invented time travel a lot earlier had he been aware of time traveling versions of himself and others before the whole Infinity War happened. This, the version of Stark visited and robbed by his future self certainly was, unless that technologically advanced SHIELD building had no CCTV.In conclusion, love the time travel concept proposed by this film. It deserves a thorough treatment in a film willing to explore its weird implications. But sadly this movie does not follow it through, and never could have done, given all the mad fights, one-liners and dramatic moments they had to fit in.In hindsight, it looks like the Russos were desperate, they painted themselves into a corner, and they resorted in the end(game) to the last refuge of the script charlatan - an inconsistent time travel premise - to creep out of it. It was still a fun time. But a quality film or satisfying conclusion to the story arc, not so much.",positive
"Absolute deconstruction of original characters and the universe, this nonsensical circus seems only aiming to cram as much ""political correctness"", painful attempts at humor and cheap pathos into torturous 3 hours.
One can only wish for infinity gauntlet to snap away the bad acting, horrible scenario and hollywood itself.",negative
No spoilers except expect to cry at some point. Can't believe this phase is over. I love these movies.,positive
"When you're honest with yourself, it's a 7-8/10. Which is still good but not perfect. I laughed a lot, I enjoyed it. But still too many darn characters can be overwhelming. You had to make it 3 hours long so they could all get 5 minutes. In the flip side, no Chris Pratt is pretty annoying. I still think it's hilarious that everyone and their pets (raccoon pun intended) are allowed to be an Avenger but Wolverine, an actual Avenger isn't one. Captain Marvel has got to be the worst addition to the franchise, like who invited SuperGirl to come in and be all perfect and impervious, yawn. All and all, a good movie with minimal plot holes, unlike Infinity war which had 0 plot and was mind numbing. It was a fitting in to a decent franchise. Now let's make 3 more movies with Thor and the Guardians.",positive
Honestly I found the first two hours to be pretty boring. A lot of it seemed unnecessary and drawn out to me but the final hour definitely picked up and was amazing. I was close to giving this a 7 but the end definitely had me emotional which never happens to me so clearly it had an effect on me! Great performances by RDJ and Chris Evans. Not so great performance by Scarlett Johansson though. Everyone else was good although Thor's issues were kind of too much after a while.,positive
Straight away a 10/10...no question. Anyone who votes less than a 9/10 should ask the question 'what is the meaning of life?' Or even better as 'why am I here on this planet?' Yes there are loopholes...you try making 21 movies and making them all relate to one another and also please comic fans at the same time. Fitting closure to Iron Mans story. So emotional and well put together. The movie was made by fans and for fans. So thankful such a masterpiece was made in my time!!!!,positive
"Avengers End GameSo after twelve months of fan theories and speculation we finally get to see what happens to our surviving heroes after the events of Infinity war.
End game isn't just a conclusion to that movie but to all the movies from the Marvel cinematic universe.
This is a tall order for Directors the Russo brothers but boy have they nailed it!
End game is a sombre affair as you'd expect after half of all living creatures have been wiped out of the universe.
Essentially a movie that is spit into three defining acts.
The first showing the aftermath of Thanos's actions.
The second act is devoted to the surviving Avengers desperately trying to fight back (delivering fan service by the bucket load) before a satisfying conclusion that will have everyone on the edge of their seat.
End game may not ultimately thrill in the same way as Infinity War did but this final chapter is riveting from a storytelling point of view. It's a much deeper movie than its predecessor.
Only when revisiting Infinity War after End Game do you fully appreciate the amount of creativity that's gone into making both movies.
How the Russo brothers have managed to weave every story and character arc together is commendable.
Trying to decide which movie is best is difficult because I see them as one big five hour masterpiece rather than two separate movies.
I'm trying to remain vague here as I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't yet seen the film.
Just as an insurance policy I've declared that this review may contain spoilers.
What I can divulge is that End Game is three hours of your life that you will be fully immersed and ultimately enjoy.
The lengthy runtime will fly by unnoticed.
Despite the sombre tone there's humour in this film.
The script writers employed by the MCU
are experts in creating witty dialogue and even though this film is serious it boasts more belly laughs than some intentional comedies.
The humour doesn't detract from what's at stake, rather it allows the audience a break from the building tension. Stakes are indeed high and all through the film there's a nagging doubt that The Avengers may actually fail.
It's refreshing that both this movie and its predecessor make believe that the bad guys can win.
Just like in real life there's not always a happy ending.
But after the events of Infinity War the good guys and the audience need that payoff.
Will it come? Well that's something you will have to find out for yourselves.
It's no spoiler to say there will be sacrifices along the way and the MCU will take a different path in the future.
End game is indeed an epic conclusion to all the hours of movies you have invested in up to this point.
It is of course a splendid technical achievement in terms of film making.
The nostalgic second act proves this.
Like its predecessor Infinity War, End Game will get even better with multiple revisits.
Definitely a film that I'm excited to see again.",positive
What a film from start to finish. As per usual Marvel have gone and done it again.. Best film by a mile,positive
"Like every time travel movie ever made Avengers Endgame established ""rules"" of time travel and then broke them repeatedly. Time travel movies never have sound logic and this isn't an exception. Like I said, it had some fun moments but overall it was meh.P.S. Fat Thor did nothing for the story line, it made his earth-shattering experience seem funny. Making him fat was good for one laugh and then it just got old, in my opinion.",positive
"No words except claps, cheers and cries. This movie is the greatest movie of 2019. A truly satisfying conclusion to the MCU. The Russo brothers have proven once again how good of filmmakers they are.",positive
"I really want to try a make a decent review about this movie but I can't seem to come to a conclusion whether or not I can definitively like it overall. As far as the plot goes it seemed like a real cop out way to solve all the problems while also leaving as many doors open as possible for future ideas. The story does a terrible job at being able to stand by itself in the cinematic universe as there are so many call backs to past films. Fans who have seen all the movies will have a blast but those who are not familiar with the 21 movie lineup will be left out of the loop. I have to recommend refreshing yourself with some of the significant entries in the universe to fully appreciate the spectacle you are about to see.Like I said in the title this movie has so much fan service that you can't help but leap and yell they actually did that! Of course I will not mention any of it but it had to be said that they get a freaking A+ for adding as much as they did in one jam packed movie. I am honestly trying to express my feelings about the beautiful ending but no matter what I type, it feels as though I am going to give something away. I will keep it short and say they made it so sweet, sincere, and heartbreaking that this may be where some fans will stop watching and say ""this is the conclusion I wanted""... well of course in actuality they won't cause the MCU is awesome but the thought will cross their mind. :)Overall I have decided that I enjoyed watching this entry but still prefer part 1. Mainly because it is concise and straight forward; you really have to be open minded and go with the flow in part 2 which I didn't enjoy.",positive
"Thanos had more understandable intentions for killing half the universe in the graphic novel and his intentions also made more sense but also made him seem eviler because he is literally in love with death and loves killing people because of that fact, I mean he's called the mad titan for a reason, you idiots working at Marvel. He's also named after the Greek god of death you stupid idiots all he wants to do is kill people literally. In this movie, however; and in infinity war Thanos is a big ugly bald crybaby and only wants to kill half the universe because he thinks that will stop overpopulation or some nonsense which it won't permanently the population will just go back to what it was eventually he solved nothing if he wanted to stop overpopulation he should have killed 100% of the universe's population along with the annoying guardians of the galaxy.
And then they just do a back to the future and resurrect everyone which is stupid and cliché and meaningless because no one died, nothing of value happened, nothing had a lasting impact for more than a few months blah blah blah they killed iron man thankfully, since he wan't the iron man that Stan lee and jack Kirby created in the 60's he was just a shell of man pun not intended (in case you didn't know his nickname is ole' shell head) this Iron Man helped ruin the last Spiderman movie but he will likely help ruin the next one too along with help from all the bad writing.
Also, Thanos' costume looks bad I hate how they have to make all the superhero costumes look more realistic or really more like pretentious modern art with weird textures. But back to the movie, it looks like it has over used CGI all marvel movies are just big cartoons with real actors in the old cartoons from the 90's and early 2000's looked better and the action looked realistic within the universe rather than jarring. Tired of the marvels they are all the same except infinity war where everyone's least favorite characters die exempt fake ant man as seen in this film, which is not as good because all the annoying characters come back.",negative
This movie may not have lived up to many of your expectations but when you really get down to it and listen to the whole of the movies all 22 of them and then watch this you will come to see it's perfect it stands by its roots and also reshapes what we believe is possible from the marvel movies no spoilers bu here but there cant be life without death right.,positive
"This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations.",positive
"Warning: This movie will exceed your expectation!!!Marvel has quite mastered the art of story-telling!The trailer has been teasing us with pretty much nothing and what a way to promote Endgame.In the rarity of today's world, where most trailers almost tell you everything in 3 minutes.This review is about to reveal nothing just like the trailer did other than what an epic conclusion!!Tears 7/10
Intrigue 9/10
Mystery 8.5/10
Ending 9.5/10p.s. There is no post end credit scene. Save yourself 10 minutes of time.",positive

"The movie left me shocked, and astonished. Great movie, Best Marvel movie by a long shot. Wow, just Wow.",positive
Far surpasses the hype. Going back again as soon as possible for an IMAX experience.,positive
"It wasn't bad, bu it's a simple action cliche, with humor, without drama or deep message. What special about infinity war, is the conflict. The villain is not all evil. He wants to create a better world for everyone to thrive. Infinity war ends with a dissonance, and many viewers, me included asked themselves - maybe he is right. Endgame starts with a simple answer - the world is a mess after Thanos actions. I think the world can thrive even with half of the population, but here right from the beginning the answer is simple. Endgame switched from the attempt to make the bad guy have deep character, into a clear message: ""Thanos is all bad"". Well this message continues through the entire movie, and I hate the fact they ruined the deep complex villain character, with a ""want to destroy all, including his comrades "" boring villain.",positive
"The film once again managed to include all emotions, just like infinity war did.
At the beginning it was not what I was expecting, and from I've gathered this has caused many people to disregard the whole film, but the fact they tried something different makes it unique. The film still reached a point where the whole tone flipped and this is where it became even better.
This is the only film I have been to see that has made the audience applaud, that must show how these films have been able to create such a connection with the MCU community to the characters.",positive
"Will probably get killed with dislikes, but hear me out before you come at me:To set things straight; yes this was a good action movie. Was it more than that? Not really. Let me explain why.1. The whole thing about fortnite, hulk-dabs and fatty-Thor was really .. unnecessary. I really love how Marvel use humor in their movies - but this is reaching.2. I love paying for long movies, but I hate checking my watch mid-playtime. It felt like some parts of the movie could've been clipped out to keep the flow going a little better.3. The last fight scene has been named by some as one of the best ever on screen. I have to disagree. The clash was both very messy and clumsy. It was hard to focus on what really happened, and it felt like they had to bring just everything without thinking about how it looked on screen. Personally I felt nothing special about it, and there were really never a point we're i wondered if our heroes would prevail...To sum my review up; Marvel has ended one of their best series, and they did it in a decent way. Sadly it feels like they are trying to please more children, especially when they force stuff like Fortnite and dabbing into the movie. I'm disappointed, but yet I had a good time.",positive
"Infinity was one of the best films ever! This is a disgrace of a follow-up. Slow, elongated and boring. I sat through 1.5 hours and gave up, waiting for something to happen. My advice, do not bother!",negative
Just Awesome. An epic conclusion of an epic storyline. Makes you both happy and sad. One of the best superhero movies ever.,positive

"The last time he met, he knew she was staying in the past, she knew he came from the future. ""Everyone can't be the ideal self,"" she told him. ""It's up to a person or a hero to see if they succeed in being themselves."" They did it, enough. The building of the gods has collapsed and the body has become empty. Since we are different, let's say goodbye. Just because we know life and death, we no longer fear life and death; just because we look down on life and death, we can calmly die; because we love life here, we are still afraid of death; because I know you know I will die, so I dare to love you 3000 times.",positive
"Take three hours to say goodbye. It is assembly, it is reunion, it is farewell, it is sacrifice. As the final installment of the series, I've really tried to do my best, with some laughs, some tears, and some kinks. This generation is over. See you next generation!",positive
Infinity War was much better. This movie was all over the place and lazy. They reduced Thor and Hulk to an absolute joke.,positive
"Hands down the best movie I've ever seen, everything about it was spot on. How they went back through different MCU movies and tied them all in right through to the end on how they brought everybody back! You'll have to wait another few years to find another good film like this!!",positive
Wanted to love this movie. I really did.All the Marvel movies have been great the last few years. Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther were superb. Infinity War was spectacular. Endgame was disappointing.Shame.,positive
"We are up to number... 15?? 20?? Whatever... in Disney's desperate attempts to wring every last cent out of what at the time was a clever new take on super hero movies with Iron Man. So I shouldn't be surprised that the writers and editors are phoning it in by now but it really shows.
I would suggest the writers get a copy of any of the top 100 books on screenwriting... any one at all... and read the very first lesson of any of those books, you know, the one where they say ""show don't tell"". I guarantee that we didn't need 80% of the movie to be exposition from the characters, especially in a superhero movie. I am sure the CGI team, you know, the people who take up most of the credits, could have fired up the Unreal Engine and pumped out a few more video game cut scenes to fill us in.
But I shouldn't blame this all on the writers, the editors pretty much looked at all of the footage, every last scrap of boring exposition and said ""whatever, just chuck it all in"". My girlfriend actually skipped a minute of dialogue at one point and it made no difference at all.
I would complain about the obvious cringe, especially during that lame scene at the end but so many of Marvel (property of the Mouse) fans probably see that cringe as a positive aspect. Whatever, it's hard to find a movie with less cringe nowadays, so it's to be expected.
There were a couple of great laugh out loud jokes and fat Thor was great, not to mention the Thor/Starlord dialogue.
But I can't recommend sitting through 2.5 hours of exposition and awkward CGI for the few brilliant moments.
I guess you could look at it as a learning experience, Avengers showed us how a huge ensemble superhero movie could be done right and Avengers Endgame showed us how to do it poorly.",negative
"Ok I have to say this is my most difficult film to give a rating.My MCU fan side gives this a perfect 10.
All the fan service is very well placed. It's a roller coaster of emotions and final Battle feels so epic.All the actors performances are incredible really the original 6 Avengers give their best performances in this movie.Best Moments
When Tony reunites with Peter.Tony seeing his father againTony's interactions with his daughterThor getting his hammer backCaptain America of the present vs Captain America of the pastNatasha and Clint in VormirAvengers assemble. It was really epic seeing all our heroes together for the first appearing in those rings strange didThe battle with all the Avengers so exciting and suspenseful and everything you wanted in an MCU film.Now the tricky part.well as a regular standalone flick is an 8/10 especially if you look for superhero movies for the action.It has very little action compared to Infinity War and most of the best moments are only really cool if you are a fan of you are not all these great moments of the film will feel like nothing special.Another small problem in this film
It was really nice seeing all the girls together but it served only as nice photo nothing really big happened with them after that moment.I was excited seeing them all together against Thanos but ughh it only worked as exposition.
Another interesting point in this film it's that if feels like a film of three different genres. One genre per hour.The first hour Is a drama, the second hour is a heist movie like Oceans 11 or the Italian Job and the third it's finally that epic action adventure superhero movie.",positive
Woooooooooooooow..... what did I just watched.... I was sad and happy in the same time. I really enjoyed watching it.... EPIC,positive
"This is without a doubt the best,most emotional,sentimental,unexpected movie I've seen in my life
It got me crying like a baby several times and smiling and emotional I mean wow what a way to finish a decade of making great movies,absolutely amazing",positive
Avengers infinity War was one of those heart stopping movies. It had everything going on and it just worked out perfect. Going into End Game I had high expectations and was sadly disappointed. The movie was very underwhelming. May I even say boring at times.,positive
"I can't say more than that I have enjoyed every single second! People and even some critics can't stop complaining about the length of this movie, which doesn't line up to the fact that this is the end (together with far from home) of an era containing 22 movies! What else is there to say? Well, I didn't have such a great time in cinema for a year, the last one was Infinity War;)
To come to an end: Every emotion was affected by this movie, literally EVERY emotion! From joy to anger, over to fear, ending in sadness...This is one of the best movies in the past 7 years! So if you haven't seen it yet: Go ahead!!!",positive
"Just came out of the cinema and the first word coming to my mind is 'EPIC'. This movie concluded the past 11 years in the best possible way or even better because a movie like this seemed to be impossible. The great battle scene is the very best in cinematic history, to be honest it is almost as good as an orgasm. I am happy that I could witness it - what is more on the premiere day. This masterpiece made me prouder than ever to be an MCU fan! Well done! Pretty sure I will pay to see it again... and again... :)",positive

This movie is very good, there is no mistake in it. but some moment is missing in this movie I wanted to see a single fight between iron Man and thanos. Also with the main character of MCU. but overall it's a good movie and I love 3000 and special thanks for Russo brother and Stan Lee..",positive
"I had very high hopes for this movie when it started at one minute past midnight on the day of release. It just took so long to get started (for me).
Now let me just say I LOVE MARVEL MOVIES I've seen them all at the cinema , I've bought all the DVD'S and I know that Endgame will be the last we'll see of certain stars in the MCU but this film was too long and in some parts downright depressing.
Captain Marvel did not get enough air time for me, neither did Black Widow and The Hulk looked a lot smaller than he did in Ragnarok, these are just some of my observations and I've many, many more.
The best part of the movie was the Battle at the end, it just a shame it took so long to get there.",positive
What was that. A fat useless thor. Bits of old stuff. An ant. A stupid looking not the hulk.. I give up. That was awful.. All hype. 3 hours of my life I can't get back... You wait it will dawn on you... This was just a bad film.,negative
My gosh! I laughed. I cried. I was at the edge of my seat. I was glued to my seat not knowing what to expect. I felt a wave of nostalgia ebb and flow. I cried some more.This movie was comprehensive and covered all its bases as far as closing the chapter on all the avengers movies. I also appreciated the balance between the human side of the heroes (showing how loosing everyone effected them) and the fight scenes.The final battle for the infinity stones left me in tears. I thought it was beautiful that captain America was able to wield thor's hammer. And when all the heroes started to materialize out of nowhere I thought I would scream with excitement!I have been a fan of the avengers since day one and heavily invested emotionally in every movie. I'm sad to see it end especially for iron man and captain America (my favorite avenger). I guess now I will wait to see what else marvel has in store for us.,positive
"Great visuals and sound, solid acting and directing. A few problems with the plot, mostly surrounding the use of time travel (can't say more without major spoilers but it's mostly consistency issues). But overall a solid finale to the first three phases of the franchise.",positive
"Words aren't enough to describe the culmination of the Infinity Saga. It was just beautiful, from the amazing action set pieces to the well knit plot that tied up all the main character's story archs in a fulfilling way, all I can say is Marvel and the Russo Brothers really outdid themselves this time round. 11/10 for me.",positive
"This is my first review ever at IMDB and English is not my first language so please bear with me.I have been a movies geek since my childhood and in my whole life I never watched any movie in cinema, yeah you heard that right. (feeling bad about it).Avengers: Endgame was my first movie I watched in Cinema with my buddy with an extraordinary hyped built after the events of Infinity War, but trust me it lacks the potential like Infinity war built already and also the reviews ( 8.9 ratings seriously) and how much this made money so far is just beyond me. gotta say here, INIFITY WAR was much better. stop trending the hype of Endgame its not that special.because some of the reasons why:1. Hawkeye received way too much screentime, that was just WHAT & Why ?
2. How in the world Cap America was able to pick up THOR's Hammer, they never told us in previous movies or did they ?
3. They literally destroyed THOR's & HULK's charisma by changing their conditions, if you know what I mean. I just kept waiting till the end to see both in the shape again but that never happen sadly.
4. Wanda maximoff with that much power lol just lol
5. That going back to past and future stuff was really confusing and not satisfying imo.
6. The ending fight scenes were really disappointing they could've done the better way.I would say INFINITY WAR was classic specially the way they portrayed THANOS devilish personality & how genius he was but in Endgame it was nothing like that, they failed him for purpose.Otherwise the movie score and that CGI in the ending battle was top notch.P.s : I don't wanna hurt Fans feelings I am just devastatingly disappointed.",positive
"This isn't so much a movie as an experience. And the homework needed to fully appreciate this is daunting for the most dedicated fans. But the pay-off for sticking with the MCU for 11 years and 22 movies is nothing short of spectacular. So many shocking developments, awesome moments and tear jerking scenes that even the most critical, cynical moviegoers will just be beaten into thoroughly enjoying this movie. There will never be another cinematic moment like this.",positive
"(No spoilers here) Avengers: Endgame is a triumph. I couldn't think of a more satisfying conclusion to this era of the MCU. It starts off slow, but still very interesting. The first two acts definitely focus more on character work than having a very tightly paced film that doesn't even allow you to breathe such as Infinity War. We start out with the main cast in a state of defeat and devastation from the events of Infinity War and let me just say, we get some great, great, great performances here. The acting in this movie is so freaking good! The first act takes the characters down some really unexpected paths. Some of them I was all for, but two of them (won't say who) I found questionable. Once the second act starts and they come up with a plan to undo what Thanos did in Infinity War, that's when things get REALLY interesting. They time travel back to a few past MCU movies and not only deliver nostalgia and great payoffs, but also gives a deeper understanding and a greater appreciation for these past movies. There were also quite a few ""Oh shoot!"" moments as well. The first two acts were great, but the third was freaking mind boggling! The set piece, the action, the scope, the intensity, the stakes, the jaw dropping moments, the raw emotion, it's all here and I could not think of a better final battle. Just wow! This movie does carry quite a deal of heavy moments and a couple of death scenes which are very impactful. A lot of people in my theater were silently crying at the end. I didn't, but man it hurt! My favorite characters in the film were probably the big three (Cap, Iron Man, and Thor). If I had to choose one, it would have to be Cap. The completion to his arc was just incredible. Poetic, sweet, and extremely heartfelt. Just brilliant. There are a few (and I mean very few) gripes/nitpicks I have with this movie, but the magnitude of this film's greatness effortlessly gobbles up those tiny little nuisances. If you're a person like me who has seen every MCU film, then this movie was incredibly rewarding. However, if you're going into this movie blind or only having seen a few years f the MCU entries, it's likely you'll get confused quite often and miss most of the great callbacks. But I think you would find that there's still a ton of fun to be had with this one.Sweet, powerful, epic, emotional, gargantuan, poetic, symbolic, deep, rewarding, shocking, unpredictable, satisfying, Avengers: Endgame is a movie that will most definitely be talked about for generations. The MCU is truly the Star Wars of this generation. My grade: A+",positive
Avengers endgame one of the most anticipated movies of 2019 was watchable. The story was way too predictable except the ending. Movie contains some of the best VFX graphics well it's Marvel. The performances of the actors is also very brilliant. MCU fans won't want to miss it.,positive

"The movie seems to be dragged. If you're going in with an expectation that it will contain lots of action, you'll be disappointed. Few major characters have been watered down in significance as well. Overall decent movie, but won't watch it again.

"I don't know if I would like to go to another marvel film after that - the writing was really bad!
Why did Captain Marvel didn't do that instead of Iron Man? She is pure energy...
Why did Dr. Strange didn't opened a huge portal for Thanos and took them elsewhere?
Or more simply why no one let Strange the time-stone and he just make a milion years go by on Thanos army.

"The MCU has been going on for 11 years when this movie came out, which in my eyes has been a mix of really bland, mediocre movies and some of the best blockbusters of the past few decades. When a director or the writers are given a distinct viewpoint of where to take these superhero stories, it can be really fun and exciting. But when the direction is at service of the same generic Marvel style action with cringey humour, I have no interest. Endgame is a mix of these two elements: Half of this movie is an epic, an exciting conclusion to the Marvel Universe. And yet the other half is a continuation of that same marvel style that is completely unengaging for me, that'll lead to a series of uninspired sequels that will take over the movie industry.I think the main problem with this movie is it's script, more specifically, the plot. In my opinion, most movies don't suffer from a bad script, more from bad execution, when they are bad because most scripts have a good structure to them. All the elements in scripts are there, and it's up to the directors to fulfill them. And I think the problem in this movie, unlike a lot of marvel scripts, the elements aren't all there. For the movie billed as the grand finale to the Marvel Universe (which it isn't to no one's surprise) there is relatively little stakes. Now I know that in a literal plot sense there is huge stakes. However, the movies makes a major mistake in failing to really convince us of the gravity of the situation. There isn't enough scenes where we see people genuinely upset over the last movie. It's partially due to direction, but also due to the limited amount of scenes really taking in the loss. I think partially because it makes a time jump so soon. I don't dislike the idea of the time jump, and I like that it means that this event had consequences and wasn't just done away in a few days. However, by the time we get up to the new part, everyone has kind of moved on. Thanos is dead, so there is no threat, an idea that I don't mind. However, there is no real feeling that the world has been plunged into darkness. The only character who really feels like they have been deeply affected is Hawkeye, who we get very little of. Thor is also affected, but they turn his character into a joke so there's no weight there (no pun intended).The stakes are obvious to us, but they aren't written. And a big problem is that the time heist is never given enough stakes. There's never much real dread, no real prospects of danger. The time heist ultimately becomes a fun but distracting affair, because we are never given the allusion that there is danger. It's strange to me because it's not that difficult. All is needed is a scene that establishes that Thanos anticipated that someone could go back and could track them or something, meaning they have to be quick. There doesn't need to be an antagonist in the time heist sections, but there needs to be a sense of danger that isn't there at all. These people, we assume, haven't been fighting for five years, you'd think this might present any challenge. But no.And this weird choice goes into our antagonist. Thanos 2014 is deliberately defined as a different character, that is basically just evil. Firstly, they completely neglect the fact that I think Thanos does know who the Avengers are back then. Even if he didn't just say that he did, because we don't know. A personal relationship between protagonist and antagonist is integral to making a good villain, and especially an epic where there are real stakes. But Thanos doesn't really know them. Yet he wants revenge for them killing his future self, and basically comes up with a completely new goal in the span of a few hours. He wants to kill everything, oh no! While the ending battle is great, it is diminished a bit by how little we care about this new Thanos. It's annoying to me, because they didn't need to kill Thanos and replace him.In general though, this is a well directed movie. I don't love the way the Russos direct the hand to hand combat scenes, it's a little to shaky cam and unconvincing, but I like in general the way they make heroes feel real. And I also like at the end how they handle the grand fight scenes, the stuff in Infinity War that was mostly missing in this movie. And while the Time Heist is distracting, I do always like how time travel works with older movies Back to the Future 2 style. It is fun to see older characters who are dead come back for a new scene. And I really like how it feels like they are committing to a conclusion. In my eyes, while they will continue making movies, this to me will still be there biggest movie, because I feel like this is where the MCU will start to slow down a bit. I also really like, as a fan of world building, how unlike the rest of the MCU movies they seem to have had an event that will have significant reprecussions for other MCU films.I think overall that this movie has equal parts good and bad, although the good somewhat overwhelm the bad. I think it could have been much better, as do I think of the MCU as a whole, but I'm happy where it went off. I wish this could be the last movie in the franchise, but this engine will keep roaring.",positive
"Its an amazing movie to watch. Everything is so grand. Directors binded every piece amazingly well. There's right amount of humour and seriousness and its just blend so well.
Cudos to Marvel team!!
A must must watch to every marvel fan and those who are not in marvel can watch for its amazing action ,humour, grand scale cinematography and What not.
In short a must watch for every one!",positive
"There are a handful of Marvel films better than this one, but they are few and far between.The movie could probably have aired an hour shorter and been better. I almost dozed off a few times. Almost.Things I liked:
Intro scene and the ""real life"" aftermath of Thanos
Thanos destroying the stones and living peacefully
Killing off main characters (iron man and widow)
The battle (with the exception of the all woman scene)
Thanos realizing he had to kill all life and start new
Captain America not coming back.
Fat Thor throughout the entire movie.The rest was pretty boring and the Hulk was annoying.Ragnarok, Infinity War, Dr Strange, and Iron Man were all better movies.Sue me.",positive
It lacked many of the major events that we were wanting for,negative

I think it would disrespect the movie if you write something about this movie...,positive
"After 21 movies in the MCU, Endgame manages to not only bring a satisfying ending for this saga, but it also manages to bring up a coherent story full of intense and emotional moments, and a wonderful third act final battle that blows my mind. Despite having an ambitious plot overall, the Russo Brothers created an espectacular movie where everyone in the general audience can enjoy.",positive
"This will go down as one of the greatest comic book films in history. It's a true blockbuster achievement. The reason I love the MCU is not because of action, it's not because of the visuals, it's because of the characters. I love these characters and truly relate to some of them on a deep personal level. I saw Iron Man when I was 11 years old and Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark has literally been a part of my childhood since that movie. And Marvel has done a really wonderful job building these characters and crafting their stories because this movie was a phenomenal ending. Sure it hasn't always been perfect but I really don't see how you could have ended it any better with the way they crafted their story. It all felt right and made sense. The 3 hours never stalled for me because I was just really invested in what everyone was feeling and thinking. Call me a baby but I teared up every 10 minutes because of a piece of dialogue or emotion a character delivered because it was so in line with what they've been through. By the end, I was bawling even when the credits were still rolling. On a more critical side of things this movie won't be something you can pick up any day and watch on video. Infinity War definitely benefits more from the action and pacing side of things and it's a lot easier to watch because of how fast everything moves. But this is required so much emotional investment that when you throw it on then you know you gotta clear your schedule. There's so much movie in this movie it's hard to really just sit down and not get up during it. There's no room for bathroom breaks unless you really don't care that much lol. So will everyone love this? No. But if you put alot of time and investment into these characters and these movies, and you care about their struggles and the things they've been through, you'll find some emotional pay off in this movie I promise. Cap is my favorite Avenger and I was completely satisfied with his arc in these movies. Much like Infinity War this movie is an experience and one you'll remember hopefully. I'm seeing this again as soon as possible and I would just like to thank Marvel for being a home for my childhood at the movies. I love Star Wars but I never got to experience the original trilogy in theaters. That movie magic and impact was displayed for me in the MCU. This was my Star Wars. Thank you Marvel thank you. 10/10.",positive
"The only gripe I have with this film is that old Cap didn't acknowledge his best friend Bucky's existence!! :'(That aside, the film was funny, incredibly emotional and touching whilst balancing all of the characters well throughout the film. The perfect sequel to the epic Infinity War and the Infinity Saga on a whole! Thanks to the Hulk for taking the stairs (huge Loki fan). Tony's death is one of the most emotional scenes I've EVER seen and it was done BEAUTIFULLY!! WELL DONE MARVEL! That took A LOT of courage on your part. Cheers! The character interactions were top-notch as expected and the whole time heist was a treat and so was the final battle. Natasha's death was devastating and tragic but well done.",positive
"After 11 years, Avengers: Endgame is a truly MCU's finest hour ! This will be the most satisfying movie ever had from the MCU, and the Russo brothers dedicated everything to gives this cinematic achievement as a celebration to Marvel's brand and an epic conclusion to Infinity's Saga.But with the #DontSpoilTheEndgame's trend, I suggest that you should go see the movie immediately ! The less you know, the fun and the best experience you'll have to this amazing film.For me, It is such a great big film as much as The Return of the King and Ben-Hur ! (Possibly, it might be Ben-Hur to this generation too.) And as much as a superheroes film goes, I says this is the best Superheroes film of the decade (or in 2010's) that could go along with the greatness of The Dark Knight.Thank you, Kevin Feige. Thank you, Joe and Anthony Russo. Thank you, to all the MCU's cast. Thank you, Disney. You guys just made a classic film for everyone and I hope Stan Lee proud on this great cinematic achievement.",positive
"That's it, not even a drop of sense on this one. They completely ruined Thanos Hulk and Thor and after that they dug a hole so deep and had no idea what to do with it. I don't even want to write anymore because the more I think the worse it gets.. they rushed this one too fast. With so many possibilities to do it, it's really sad to end an era like this.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is simply the most marvelous superhero film ever made. This epic cinematic masterpiece from the Marvel Studios is undoubtedly the greatest achievement in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by the Russo brothers, this movie is the culmination of more than a decade of storytelling that is both thrilling and emotional. The excellent cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Scarlett Johansson, gives an outstanding performance, ensuring that the emotional core of this film is as strong as its action sequences. The film's pacing is perfect, and the storyline is outstanding, with engaging and thrilling twists and turns that will leave you on the edge of your seat throughout its runtime. The visual effects are also exceptional, with outstanding action sequences that are both intense and awe-inspiring. In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is an epic and satisfying conclusion to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that is deserving of its spot as the highest-grossing film of all time. A perfect 10/10 rating is without a doubt, given to this phenomenal film.",positive
"I cannot recall another movie during which my wife fell asleep so may times. Very boring, very long, full of plot holes. You will not enjoy this unless you get excited when you see hundreds of Marvel characters in one shot. And if you are not a total Marvel freak than you will have no idea who they are.",positive
"This is hopefully the end of this long standing, inconsistent, money spinning series. And it's also the worst of them all. First hour or so...one or two fight scenes. The rest is back slapping in jokes that you'd have to memorise all the other films to get, long drawn out pointless 'science' scenes or 'hilarious' takes on each characters' past dislike of each other (didn't two used to fancy each other? It's like that never happened), and oh yeh the characters all change...like all the time. Remember when this one was bad and this one was good? Not anymore! And what is with their hair?! At the initial meeting to discuss the film concept did someone just say ""hair. Too benign. Let's jazz that up a bit"" because it's as if one of the Avengers is Vidal Sassoon all of a sudden.This should be buried in a pit for future generations marked ""stop watching after Age of Ultron""",negative

"As an avid MCU Films fan, the Avengers: Endgame was by far THE BEST MCU FILM. For 10 years MCU has always delivered blockbuster movies and Endgame felt like their BIG BANG or LAST HURRAH; a trophy for all the 20 MCU films we have seen and loved.Sitting through a 3-hour film never felt this quick but it was not short of satisfaction. It gave me all the feels, from laughs, to tears, to being in awe, to surprises.However, I wouldn't recommend watching this without watching all the MCU Films before this.Avengers: Endgame is WORTH THE HYPE. This is the finale that will stay with us.",positive
"This movie is beyond what the fans expected. It is a perfect combination of comedy, sadness at some points, action and what not. It reveals all the secrets till date in the MCU and that too in a way very systematic and logical manner. All the sequences of retrieving the time stones from the past are just marvel-ous. Every character gets his/her intro whether or not he/she is alive. I literally got goosebumps in the last scene when all the avengers assembled to fight thanos's and his army. The background score amplified the goosebumps. Every second of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat. In a nutshell, it was a amazing experince which I will never forget in my life. I thank Mr. Anthony Russo and Mr. Joe Russo for creating such a wonder.",positive
"If you think you have figured it out all yet you haven't, amazing ending to the greatest saga, 3 hours have passed like it was an hour, the humor is there, the tears, the powerful visuals, won't say much, every person has to see it. Amazing amazing amazing",positive
"Honestly, I think there are too many Heroes for one movie so Thanos definitely helped us out. That said, the writers do exceptionally well to weave all the back stories, relationships, characters and emotional hee-haw together in one crazy 3 hour rollercoaster ride of CG action, emotion and gags.Great fun but I yearn for the simpler single hero movies of yore, even though I still think the first Avengers movie was the Greatest!!!That said, this will break every box office record as it is a MUST SEE!!!",positive
"Avengers: Endgame could accurately be described as a sort of tragedy: a depiction of an action (or a sum of actions) of noble character. The story revolves around men and women that are (super)heroes - individuals who are above the common thought, life and character (ethos) of most people. When we look at them, what we get to see is a group of characters willing to sacrifice everything to win the battle between ""the epic forces of darkness and light"" (Iron Man in his posthumous message) - everything except the good itself (""we don't bargain for lives""). Thus, it is a representation of two extreme possibilities of human existence: good and evil. Also, it is the affirmation of life's power over death. After all, Thanos (derived from ""Thanatos"", the greek god, brother to Hypnos, sleep) is in someway the personification of death itself, instead of being in love with Death (as portrayed in the Marvel comics). Wanting to balance the cosmic scale (a very interesting symbol), he wipes out half of life, so it won't go ""unchecked""; not in a discriminate way, but randomly - in a ""fair"" way, as he put it, precisely like death, because death reaches everyone, rich and poor, young and old, just and unjust. The heroes, on the other side, are on the side of life, life that wants to thrive and not be engulfed by death. And on the side of good, because as an individual Thanos is a cosmic murderer: it was his particular action that erased half of the population in the universe.The movie goes straight to the point. It starts with a shakespearian monologue by Tony Stark, recording a message while facing his own ""iron skull"" (a preview of the one final scenario). That message underlines the existential dread of being adrift in space, facing the emptiness of a half dead universe. Past that point, Captain Marvel appears as a light of hope, of turning things around.
That hope quickly fades away when the heroes find out that Thanos destroyed the infinity stones and they plunge in despair. Five years pass and the world is a melancholic, half empty and half full, despairing over the memories of the ones who were erased. Memory, after all, retains the past: the living could not thrive collectively after such a traumatic experience took place. The movie doesn't get into much detail, but we can imagine the horrific consequences of the collective perception that a terrible cosmic force exists and that it erased half of the population.
The heroes themselves are broken at this point. They do what they can to help others and themselves. Until an unsuspecting hero comes along (not the rat, which is just chance, not deliberate action) and offers the possibility of a ""time heist"".The time heist is a very interesting idea. Not just because it is based on memory (the past, with all its possibilities, which is curious because usually the future is the one filled with possibility) and it's fun to see what happens with the interactions, but because it plays with the idea of the quantum realm. We saw how extraordinary the power of time is in ""Doctor Strange"", and how dangerous it is. Here, we also see how powerful and dangerous it is, but with a new set of rules. The past becomes the future, the future isn't in any way changed by the past, new alternate realities are created, etc., etc. I am not sure this is cheating or not, because it is based on imagination, but I would like to stress one particular point.During the time heist, the Ancient One explains to Professor Hulk how what people perceive as the flow of time is created by the infinity stones, and how the removal of one stone would leave the world open to dark and terrible forces. It makes sense, specially considering the power of the time stone. Now, what are the true consequences - or what should've been the true consequences - of Thanos using the stones to destroy the stones? It shouldn't even be possible to do that, because the universe should have been destroyed. And once it wasn't destroyed, and that Doctor Strange now has no time stone to protect reality, does that mean the universe is now open to dark and terrible forces? Plot hole?Either way, there's one great moment in the narrative during the time heist: Black Widow's sacrifice. Despite being one the weakest avengers, along with Hawkeye, at least physically, she proved herself and her determination when she sacrificed herself to get the soul stone. In a way, she sacrificed that which she loved (her friend and his family, or the possibility of being with them) to get it. And this connection was set up during Avengers: Age of Ultron. Black Widow, like Iron Man, is willing to pay the ultimate price for the restoration of the universe.After the time heist, I would say there are two other pivotal moments. One is the acknowledgement of Captain America's worthiness to wield Mjolnir. In Avengers: Age of Ultron he was already worthy enough to make it move an inch. Now, he is worthy to have Thor's powers. His solo battle with Thanos (again, very symbolic) is amazing, simultaneously using the hammer and the shield.
The other pivotal moment, of course, is Iron Man's sacrifice. To begin with, and as a friend told me, sometimes it is definitely worth it to have great actors in a movie, because Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing in those ten seconds when he indicates that there is only one winning scenario and that that is it. And Robert Downey Jr. perfectly conveys understanding with the look in his eyes. Connecting this to the funeral scene, his sacrifice is indeed proof that Tony Stark has a heart, and that he is indeed Iron Man. Not because he has a suit, not because he's a genius, but because ultimately he is the suit of armor he wanted to build to the world. I think that is the most incredible conclusion he comes to when he is ready to face his death: because Thanos was the endgame, Tony had worked to build a suit of armor for the world (an Iron World, as it were), not realizing that he himself was that suit of armor. The world already had a suit of armor - and it worked. He wiped Thanos out of existence.Finally, I have to say why I rate this movie with a seven. I was indecisive whether I should give it an eight or a seven, but after seeing it for the second time, I think a seven is adequate. There are three major flaws in the movie for me, not to mention other smaller ones. One is Thor. It is unforgivable that Thor was turned into the role of a buffoon (an even greater one than the one in Thor: Ragnarok), a fat and broken clown. His character was driven to its full potential in Infinity War, but now it was driven to its least potential. I understand that he was broken, but becoming a fat idiot during just five years (considering he was 1500 years old) incapable of going back into shape is just disappointing. It is hard to find the appropriate words to describe how sad it is that this decisive movie ends with him like this.
The second flaw is Hulk. Once again, I understand the whole going back to unity and finding peace idea for Banner, but it's just too much. Again, not having the Hulk during Infinity War (except for those two minutes) and not having him in Endgame is just absurd. He doesn't have one decent fight sequence. The point isn't the fight itself, as if all that mattered was raw action. The point is that despite his own sacrifice when using the stones he didn't have a pivotal role to play.
Finally, and despite being a good movie, I believe the pace should have been different and that the final battle should have been more critical than it was. It deserved something more in the line of Infinity War.One last observation. I think it was very clever the way in which the writers and the directors of this movie didn't make it about Captain Marvel. It would have been terribly inconsistent to make her the big hero of the movie, considering she just showed up and there's no real connection to what has been going on for the last ten years. It was more than fitting that the big responsibility lied on the original six avenger's shoulders and, particularly, on Iron Man's. They balanced her presence, which was good, and we even got to see that her power is kind of inferior to that of Thanos wielding the power stone.A moving end to these last ten years.",positive
"Five years after Thanos (Josh Brolin) wiped out half of all life in the Universe and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) killed Thanos in rage after learning Thanos had destroyed the Infinity Stones, Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) re-emerges from the Quantum Realm after having been trapped their 5 years earlier but not having aged a day. With the Avengers now a shadow of the organization it once was, many of the heroes have since gone their separate ways. However Scott Lang believes they could undo Thanos' plan by traveling through time in the Quantum realm.The concluding chapter of the MCU's Infinity Saga, Avengers: Endgame was shot back-to-back with the same team as Avengers: Infinity War and like Infinity War was one of the most expensive movies ever made with a $400 million budget. Upon release the film broke box office records with a worldwide opening of $1.2 billion before eventually reaching just under $2.8 billion in its final tally, briefly eclipsing Avatar as the highest grossing film of all time (not adjusted for inflation) until Avatar's Chinese re-release. Much like Infinity War, Endgame is epic in both scope and scale touching on every aspect and character of the MCU sending off several characters and developing and building many others.As with Infinity War, Endgame keeps itself pretty simple in terms of its plot with the main focus and drama coming from the characters and their interactions with one another. The opening act that sees Scott Lang re-emerge in the MCU after five years have passed since Thanos enacted his plan nicely build off the often homaged and referenced ending of Infinity War wherein several prominent characters and half of the Universe's population were blinked out of existence. As this is the same team that gave us the second and third Captain America films as well as Infinity War, it should surprise no one that despite handling a large cast every character feels like they're given their due in both character and action. The time travel aspect is nicely incorporated with the audience getting to see several big moments in the MCU from another angle and even characters who were written off get a second chance to appear. Some of the creative decisions I'm not quite sure how I felt about (particularly in regards to an element of the Guardians of the Galaxy felt like it was reset back to zero) but for every moment that didn't land, there were several that did.Avengers: Endgame isn't quite as good as the setup in Infinity War, but in terms of concluding chapters for film series especially when taking into account the large number of movies setup over an 11 year period this is probably about as good as it gets.",positive
"The first half of the movie have some slow and boring scenes, not an end game type movie, missing action and the power start, the second half and the last 40 minutes marvels best, can watch multiple times only for thanos",positive
"I'd tell the story I saw but it was all so confusing. I can't believe how high the garbage has been rated!!! I have seen every marvel movie that has been release and watched and liked Infinity war though I thought it dragged on. No super hero movie should ever go for more than 2 hours...EVER. Now it has dawned on me that disney and the writers of this flick had nothing but cash in mind when planning these. The first Avengers was amazing, i believed that age of ultron was the forerunner for something epic with Thanos then these 2 movies were just a massive let down but it's all about cash and I took the bait. Hook, line and sinker. A final movie is supposed to give all the answers but this just gave me so many questions and left me confused and wondering whether I loved or hated it. Now it has sunk in and I gave it thought i just hate it. Too many contradictions. Don't get me wrong. The action is good in this movie and there are parts I loved about it but the parts i hate out weighed them. Damn you Disney!!!!",negative
"We have laughed, cried and rejoiced during the whole journey of 22 movies and have lived through them.

"Kevin Feige and the Russo Brothers have done a fantastic job here. The film is guilty of a fair amount of inevitable plot holes, for which it cannot be considered a 10/10; yet it does a fantastic job of bringing a worthy conclusion to the 22 MCU films so far. It succeeds in juggling the many character arcs, moving pieces and increasingly complicated storylines whilst keeping the movie focused and making room for some truly thrilling action sequences in addition to many laugh-out-loud moments.It's certainly worth watching Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor 2: the Dark Wold, Avengers Assemble, Captain America the Winter Soldier or, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers Infinity War, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Doctor Strange and Thor Ragnarok at the least before viewing this film. As reflected by certain reviews, there are many parts of the film which would seem confusing or frankly boring without the knowledge of the various storylines involved, yet which will be of great interest to followers of the MCU.Having watched this film I'm truly excited for phase 4 of the direction the MCU looks to be taking going forward.",positive
"***There will be NO SPOILERS in this review***AVENGERS: ENDGAME is an emotionally and artistically satisfying conclusion to 11 years and 22 films of the MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE.Closing out ""Phase III"" in the MCU, the concluding chapter for most of the ""original"" MCU characters/actors, ENDGAME picks up the Avengers story right after the conclusion of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR - a film which saw our heroes lose the battle to Thanos, who snapped his fingers and half the living beings in the Universe vanished.Instead of downplaying the grief that a survivor would feel, Directors Joe and Anthony Russo (veterans of many MCU films) wisely decide to ""lean into"" this grief which gives this film something that is surprising for a SuperHero film - emotional resonance. You grieve with these characters that you have come to know - and love - and share their pain and sorrow.It's a wise choice for it adds a layer to this film that many Superhero films fail to achieve. Along with action, fun characters that you want to root for, interesting visuals and (are you listening DC?) - HUMOR, this film has ""all the feels"" (to steal a phrase) and will leave the MCU fan (both hardcore and casual) satisfied with the experience.Also...interestingly enough...this film stands on it's own quite well. The guy next to me in the theater was a ""newbie"" to the MCU, dragged to the theater with his friends to be ""part of the crowd"" in this experience. Over the first 5 minutes he was asking his buddy a million questions about who is who and what is what...but after that he just settled into his chair and enjoyed the ride for what it is - even jumping up and cheering at a spot late in the film where EVERYONE in the sold out IMAX showing I was in was tempted to jump out of their chair and cheer (yes - there is THAT kind of moment in this film).There is also sorrow...loss...joy...relief...tension...excitement...as I said...""all the feels"". I don't usually tear up at movies, but I felt some glistening in the corners of my eyes and a lump in my throat on more than 1 occasion - sometimes with sadness, but, sometimes, with joy and exuberance. Yes! I had tears of JOY jumping out of my eyes at a few moments in this film.But, if it is Special Effects spectacle you are looking for - no worries. There are PLENTY including a finale that is worthy of being the Final Battle in the Final Film for this Phase of the series.And...the humor...this film has a surprisingly large amount of light, happy moments as well. I give the Russo Brothers - and the MCU - credit for realizing that humor is a good counterbalance to sorrow, action and suspense. I also give them credit for what character they decided to use as the ""comic relief"" in this film. It's a good choice - and the performer tapped to play the humor is equal to the task.But, of course, none of this matters if the characters aren't interesting enough to root for - and this film has it in spades. We've watched these characters grow, develop, bond and tear apart over the course of these past 11 years, so there is quite a bit of emotional investment in the characters - and this investment pays of handsomely (again...if you are a ""casual"" fan or a ""newbie"", you'll be fine). But...if you are like me and are ""into"" the MCU then there is payoff after payoff in this film that is extremely satisfying.The actors in ENDGAME are, of course, at the top of their game. They know they are capping a special moment in their careers and they ""bring it"". Starting, of course, with Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His character goes through a wide variety of emotions through the course of this film and - if this is his last MCU film - he's going out in style. As is Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America. These two are at the heart of this film - and at the heart of the MCU - and they take center stage with aplomb, tweaking their characters while respecting all that came before. To be honest, I never really bought into the Iron Man vs. Captain America ""Civil War"" storyline, but they tie that up nicely.Of course the other 4 ""Original 6 Avengers"" - Chris Hemsworth's THOR, Scarlett Johansson's BLACK WIDOW, Mark Ruffalo's BRUCE BANNER and Jeremy Renner's CLINT/HAWKEYE/RONIN - are on hand and they all have their moments and take their bows as appropriate throughout. I also have to give some ""props"" to Don Cheadle's James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes/WAR MACHINE - kind of an unsung performer in these films and is a welcome sight who would have been missed had he not been there.The other ""survivors of the snap"" - Bradley Cooper's ROCKET RACOON, Karen Gillan's NEBULA and Paul Rudd's SCOTT LANG/ANT MAN - fit in with the ""original"" Avengers quite well. This group of 10 is fun to watch. Add to them Brie Larson's CAPTAIN MARVEL to mix the drink and the concoction was intoxicating to me. A small ""quibble"" and I do mean a ""quibble"" - Danai Gurira and her character OKOYE is underutlized/underused for my tastes, but...that is just a ""quibble"".Oh...and James Brolin is back as ""big bad"" Thanos - a worthy adversary, both emotionally, intellectually and physically for this group of SuperHero's to outwit/outlast/outplay.Finally...without giving away any plot points...this story figured out a way to reflect on/pay homage to previous films in this Universe. It was a clever way to bring back stories/characters/moments from the past and to give some of these performers and moments a nice ""cameo"" curtain call.I better stop now before I give away plot points - needless to say I LOVED THIS FILM - it was a very satisfying way to say ""thank you and goodbye"" to 11 years (and 22 films) of marvelous film making.I'm looking forward to what the next 11 years in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has to offer - the bar has been set at the highest level.Letter Grade: A+10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",positive
"Well, there's no two ways about a Marvel movie: all out CGI, rib tickling humour, emotions, a very minimalistic feel of a possible romantic link up, catchy one-liners - all offered in a close to a 3hrs movie (to get the viewer interested in each one of the characters is a task no human can be 100% successful at) - as expected. All said and done, it's well worth the hype, and the wait. I still remember the good old days (at the start of Ironman franchise) thinking Ironman is meant to do something bigger. Marvel fans: that moment has arrived!!The only thing negative about this movie is: Thanos as a villain has little to do, even in this 3hour long saga; all his powers seem pointless in front of the endless list of superheroes.",positive
"Avengers Endgame is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, existing to reward the fans love, patience, and undying adoration. Endgame has a difficolt job and did it very well. It's epic and allows space for one of the best performances from Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evan. However this movie has something less than Infinity War. The entire time I was watching Infinity War I was on the edge of my seat, afraid for every character's life, but not during all the running time of Endgame. Nevertheless Endgame has more epic moments and it is such a perfect end of the Avengers that it's hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed.Rating: 9,3.",positive
"1, before the screening, I watch the credits, and was amazed to see that have helped nini in the iron man three handsome boy, that he will inherit the iron man mantle in compound 4, the results from the beginning to the end also didn't notice his lens, did not know where to put the little boy, nini nor his exit flood stage which the second generation after iron man come to continue to give us moved.2, a mage can expect a lot of things, including know, range to worship her for five years later, as he listened to the green giant suspicious, why things behind still does not change, the supreme mage is still strange, she still choose to die, not know that the earth and even the universe into crisis after choose confrontation out, to protect all this (strictly to the ancient one's death is killed is suicide, just because think happinesses), writers write here is very puzzling, let a person see the fog, always feel that if something doesn't explain clearly.3. Why is the infinity stone a gem in thanos's hands and only a snap in avengers' hands? Do you risk your body or even your life to snap your fingers? Why is thanos able to turn starlord's gun into a bubble gun, stick the hulk into the wall, or even lift a single power gem to hammer the team? Obviously full of infinite gloves have already got, there are 10,000 ways to win the war, why have to sacrifice my nini, think of this I want to cry.4, after three mile, sets out the bully is nearly all five gem subdued (strictly speaking is uniform, alternative star jenn-air when actor 😓), destroyed the with stones on the gloves made of energy has also been the thor tomahawk repression. To avengers iv, meow meow hammer blessing under the captain, add thor, iron man also did not wear gloves thanos? No! ? ! Not only lu but also be the group out?5, random through space and time, even with the past their own fight will not affect the space and time? Plus, there's a timeline in the middle, and Loki runs off with the space gem and you don't care? Then if the past time and space are not related to the present time and space, each is its own timeline, if each does not affect the other, then why go back to the past and spent a lifetime with agent carter and team America will return to the present in an old way? In other words, since Loki ran the present time and space reality will not change, then travel through the past and had already died of old carter and live a lifetime of the present reality is the same? This is a serious bug.",positive
"I am trying to be honest and being objective as much as I can : this movie is EPIC, I am sure ever single person in the world who has watched it will be pleased and satisfied. It was a complete emotion-packed movie.It has a few flaws, I am sure some Marvel fans feel it too, some may be annoyed by the flaws (the directors should have done this, done that, why not this, why not that, minor plot holes, etc) but all was paid off by its EPIC-ness.PS : I felt empty after I watched the Endgame, even until I write this review. It is not because I don't like the movie, it is just because I am not sure whether the next MCU saga will be as GREAT and EPIC as this. Good luck for the future MCU !!",positive
The film I believe was good. It came back with good comic book lines and followed some of the story lines from them but in all I didn't like the ending of the mad titan.i think Infinity War was better.,positive
"If you have such wealth of acting at your disposal but reduce most of your cast to cameo appearances the story suffers. Some of the cameos were great to watch, they are the world's best known actors after all, but to me it was just a bit too much of everything and I lost interest when I lost count of all the characters, plots and subplots. I think I like it better when they focus on one or a few superheroes. High points of the movie: any scene with Tony Stark or Thor, but why use a star like Nathalie Portman when all she has to do is look pretty and walk around a bit, it makes you wonder whether these stars are short on money though. My grandson loved it though.",negative
Super timeline and super plot. I can watch it 100 times. Just ending is too sad.,positive
A perfect blend of all Marvel super Heroes in One movie ....Thats the Avengers End Game,positive
"I don't understand the (albeit very few) low ratings for this gem of a movie but I'm guessing they have been made by individuals who have perhaps watched way too many movies of this kind and have thus failed to appreciate this beauty called Avengers: Endgame.I have not watched many of the Marvel movies but have watched a few in the lead up to Endgame including Infinity War, which was disappointing, to say the least, but Endgame more than made up for it. What a performance. Some of the characters are annoying but the annoying ones don't get too much camera time and they don't (in my opinion) ruin this outstanding masterpiece.",positive
"To anyone who went to see Iron Man in theaters when it came out,, and then followed the continuing journey as each new film debuted,,, this movie was the PERFECT conclusion (to what we've seen so far).In Infinity War,, Thanos took all our hearts and ripped them to pieces! Well this one begins right after those events.Where to begin?!? I really can't say much w/o giving away spoilers,,, so if there's anyone out there who hasn't seen this masterpiece,,, WATCH IT ALREADY!!!",positive
"This movie is awesome! If you're a marvel fan you will enjoy this but then again you have probably already seen it.
It's funny, emotional and clever.
Yeah it is very long and most definitely could have been shortened but I just enjoy the characters so much I don't even mind.",positive
Can't Say nothing it's the greatest Superhero movie of all time,positive
"The script was slow moving and often lazy.
After being so precise and covering all the bases moving up to this movie, it seems Marvel really let go on this one. They left several loopholes unexplained. Overall the movie was worth watching, but I thought Infinity Wars was much better.",positive
"It's just freaking amazing!!!!
It's the greatest movie of all time and it just changed the whole cinema history.
Nothing ever could even come nearby or defeat this movie.
It had emotional moments, action, comedy, its just the mixer of all movie's.
This is my first favourite movie.
And this deserves an Oscar, not one but billions.
Love you 3000!!

Anyone of Thor's fans wouldn't accept Marvel's adaptation of Thor. They ruined Thor this character just for making him as the funny elements of the film,positive
"OK they did all this work to not mess up the timeline. Which oddly enough was brilliant. Boring as hell, but brilliant. It all works out except Steve Rogers goes back in time and selfishly SCREWS THE ENTIRE TIMELINE UP!!!!!! Captain America would never do this. The first two hours are BORING. Then it gets good with the entire battle scene which is completely destroyed by Steve Rogers being a selfish ass! He was my favorite character until this. The writers really F'ed this up. I'm only giving 4 stars and 3 of those are because the battle scene was good. Other than that? Movie sucks a fat one. MCU has jumped the shark. Fun while it lasted.",negative
"An absolute perfect ending. The MCU began with the birth of the legendary Iron Man, and this part of it ended with the hero's death. The moment that he said ""I am Iron Man"" and snapped his fingers sold the movie for me. Even though Tony Stark had a tear-jerking death, it was an epic and heroic ending for his character, wrapping up his part of the MCU.I also adored that Steve finally gave Peggy the dance she was promised. And when he was finally worthy for Mjolnir, it tied in to Avengers: Age of Ultron extremely well.All in all, this movie was, in my opinion, a masterpiece, and I will be watching it many times again.",positive
"Its kind of sad it end here. Its so graceful that the end game doing an amazing work as usual Avengers does . And It does even the best among all. Just a super experieances to be in the cinema watching this . The audios are actually cheers and clap all the times while the movie is playing . Its a wonderful moment of all time !! What a Great work for the Hero movies like this , like all !",positive
Words can't even describe how good this movie is I love it I could watch it thousands time and probably will,positive
It was a good movie it just didn't need to take 3 hour,positive
"I'm not going to spoil anything. All I have of say is I laughed, I cried, and I got chills down my spine throughout the whole movie. The theater was packed to the rim, and everyone in my row got up in tears. This movie might have been the best I have ever seen, and I will definitely watch it again and again once it come out on the tv. Definitely as good as infinity war, and in my opinion better. If you love the avengers, you will love this movie.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is a messy, epic, convoluted film which endeavours to tie all of the loose plot threads of the past decade's worth of stories in the Marvel Universe together in order to form a cohesive movie...
It's an undeniably ambitious undertaking & the Russo Brothers handle the challenge impressively to say the least - considering how much content / previous moments they manage to sift through & reference in order for it to work. In addition, visually it's a spectacle but you're relentlessly concussed by overwhelming abundances of fan service to the point where it borders on unapologetic fan-fiction.
On the plus side, Thanos pleasingly continues to be a great villain & the final confrontation is extraordinary but unfortunately, even with a 3 hour run time, events progress at such a rapid pace, it's difficult to emotionally invest yourself in scenes which are rushing along to the next so quickly, you hardly have time to process events as they occur. Definite issues regarding that aspect of Endgame's progression.
On the other hand, this is clearly an installment which blatantly aims to bring some stories to a close whilst sparking the beginning of others, taking Marvel in a completely different direction; with that in mind, it's a success... If a little hollow & underdeveloped.
That's not to say it's bad - I enjoyed it - but did it meet or exceed my expectations? No. I hoped for better & more substance than style - the stripped back, smaller scale, increasingly character focused, more reflective sequel we were led to believe this movie was from the trailers. Not a fan of overly cheesy endings either & this unfortunately had enough cheese to top a pizza, not to mention a frustratingly convenient happy ending which felt forced & unnatural.",positive
"Let's face it: It was the most anticipated movie of the XXI century, thus a lot of expectations for the makers to reach, which is not an easy task.I would say they did it, they even surprised us, But was it the ending the way we want it? Mostly yes, and in my opinion it's a very good ending.BUT, the lack of action (imagine my kids 2.5 hours without actions...) and the way they show Earth with supposedly ""ONLY"" half the population should have disappeared but looks like 95% disappeared (half is not 95%) made me remove 2 stars on the 10/10Is the lack of action exacerbated the movie? No, not for adult as the scenario was well written, but for the younger staying 2.5 hours sitting and expecting action from their favorite super heroes was hard to manage in the cinema... and even for me, though ;) minus 1 star...No need to say that no one from my family wanted to stay to see the end credits...
But in the end of the day, every ones found that the movie and the way it ends was good but not that good!",positive
Hyper ratings are not realistic it wont go over 8.5 for me,positive
"Spoiler free.....
For those who have given this a 10, take that with a pinch of salt, it really isn't. There's a strong argument that suggests infinity war was an overall better film.
Endgame drags in places as it tries to cram in so much more, building up to a noteably predictable ending.
The direction some of the characters have taken this time around is polarising and didn't work for me. Some key MCU characters going forward we're also given limited screen time which, for those keen to know what the future holds.. I'm not sure anyone really knows now.Whilst the changing of the guard will be welcomed you do get a sense of, this is really the end of a great journey for marvel. Barring a series of solo follows ups and a play in the tv series space we're unlikely to see an avengers style films of this magnitude anytime soon!I've always been a fan ever since the iron man graced our screens, however for me, they have slipped up quite a few times along the way (Thor series) was poor and captain marvel was average.",positive
"This one was boring. They could have taken out an hour of random stuff that was just drama material and boring. Also the best characters only came in the end (Groot, chris pratt and the other dudes from guardians of the galaxy) which is the only interesting part of the movie",negative
"Absolutely loved everything about this movie. It gave me everything I hoped for, and much more. After 11 years and 22 movies, this is the finale where everything comes together. Three hours is a long sit, but I would gladly sacrifice my ass to watch a bit longer. God bless you Stan Lee. Eat that DC.",positive
"The first 50 minutes set up the movie very well but the second act lacks urgency and focus. The movie comes to a halt and feels as if it's meandering between scenes, not knowing what to do and not being very entertaining. The movie is also highly predictable and somewhat ruins Thanos's character due to a strange character decision. Iron man is given a lot to work with, which is compelling, same with Hawkeye. The ending is somewhat satisfying but also cringe. Overall it is a fine movie, not offensively bad but certainly not as good as it's predecessor.",positive
"This is the first and foremost english movie which i've/we've watched the opening show in the morning at 5am. As it marks the end of the decade long marvel collection of movies, we were very much thrilled to watch the movie asap, but still we got tickets only on the next day. It was definitely one of the fascinating experience as the movie was filled with so many things like time travel, actions, emotions, suspense, it is definitely the most anticipated movie as everybody knows but the fact that it still manages to entertain is where the movie makers excel, hats off to pull off such a massive thing. But making my favourite Iron Man disappear in the end was unexpected and long lasting.
In tamil Vijay Sethupathis' voice was just set into our sub conscious very well so it didn't set too much to the movie from the point of view of general audience like us.",positive
It's well directed. It's well edited. Great use of chi and it also gives a emotional punch along the way of this roller coaster ride of a movie,positive
"I just came out of the cinema and I'm still all processing what I've just seen.
And I'm going back in tomorrow to soak it up again. Come back here and finish the review.
I simply can't right now. What an impact it has.Just go watch, this is the worthy conclusion of the MCU.",positive
"Amazing movie, not perfect but good. Behind it there has to had been a lot of work with all those characters and storylines.Problems: too many characters and some appears only for few seconds with only a sentence. Thanos lost all his meaning and became a ''classic villain''.I hated the smart Hulk and Starlord.P. S. This is a superheroe movie his aim is to entertain more people possible and gain by it. Who says that ''It's not Cinema beacuse has not meaning behind and teach nothing'' is at fault.A comic and a book as '' War and Peace'' are different but if you read one you should not laugh of the other.",positive
"There are just far too many inconsistencies and questions with this film to mention here. Suffice it to say that there is something seriously wrong when a minor character such as Nebula gets something like 60 minutes of screen time and characters such as Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, Spiderman, Black Panther, Winter Soldier and others appear for maybe 5 minutes...",positive
"I'm honestly shocked by the amount of negative reviews of this movie, not because some people didn't like it but the by the over the top exaggeration of their expectations of how this series should end. You'd think it was the worst movie ever made and it's no where near that, everyone is entitled to their opinion but I'm not buying the absolute disgust that many are expressing, it had to end there's no way around it but don't bash it because you were expecting something different, the good guys won, you couldn't be surprised by that could you.",positive
"The beginning is a slow burn. The dialogue, especially in the first act, is basically self help puke. And it doesn't gain momentum until they discovered how to use time travel. The time travel device allows for it to have multiple money shots of past MCU moments that lean heavily on viewers being fans. It encourages us to indulge in the fan service.Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nebula shine as bright as the main cast. And the supporting characters feel useful and necessary. The big badass battle is indeed badass. In that same scene when literally everyone returns and strikes a pose, it should be lame, but it is breathtaking.All the character's endings are wrapped up nicely, and there's a deep sense of closure. During the credits, when the main cast is signing off, I got emotional. It's not really a ""movie"" per se but more like a series finale, so it's hard to score. It really just depends on how invested you are in the universe they've created.",positive
I was thinking it's gonna the perfect cbm movie of all time it's a big disappointment it's really bad a big mess of events and characters jumping in middle of the another one it's worst then josstice league,negative
"Once again I debated with myself, whether I should write a review here. I know most of you won't like what I want to say. I also know with over 4500 reviews already here, most of those who may agree with me, won't even get to see it. It will simply get lost in the sea of fake reviews (paid or otherwise) flooding most of internet sites dedicated to such things. But eventually I decided that keeping what I want to say, in my belly will hurt more. So - here goes:It's a great film based on a few false premises, some of which I already discussed here more than once. See on my review page what I've written about Infinity War, or Captain Marvel. In my personal book, every time a comics superhero dies, somebody made a mistake he (or she), didn't know how to fix. The control directors and script writers have over this sort of material is un limited. So if people don't like the character, and I mean real people not review writers that have a personal grudge against superheroines, because the actress is Israeli or because she was made too strong. If real people don't like the character, you wrote it wrong. Let's agree, it didn't happen here. People love the MCU characters, they were all beautifully written, and each actor performing them did wonders. They became as real as fictional characters can. So I knew what happened in this movie had to happen. I even wrote so in my review for infinity war. I must admit, I didn't guess the way they'll go about it, but I knew the many franchises, stemming from the MCU couldn't end. It wasn't a secrete, they kept on working on some sequells while working on this movie. And still, they did surprise me (and everybody else too). But, this sort of a surprise, dosn't cut it for me. Let's carry on with the toy box imagery, that the Russo brothers spoke about in their own IMDb interview. Think about going to play with your friend, he/she shows you a boxful of amazing toys, ""I love them to pieces"" they say, and the very next thing they take out a hummer and break some of them to smithereens. Surprise you? didn't I"" yes, you sure did, but you're an idiot. And the fact, the entire movie prooves you're not, is making it even worse.There's no reason in the world to drive the franchise this way, apart from the ego of the people having all the toys, their stupid wish to surprise us and to proove they really can do whatever they want.I may have high esteem for their abilities. I have to agree, it was a great movie - I really didn't like it. And all the reasons for the ending we got, that I can think of, are making it even worse.",positive
What do I say this movie in incredible I started watching marvel movies around when the first avengers movie came out ever sense I seen everyone of them,positive
"Amazing movie best one in mcu there is. I got disappointed with the last 5-10 mins with cap turning old and what they did to Thor which didn't get my perfect score. They were the only disappointing things everything else was everything you'd want. My heart is in pieces to see what has happened to the original six and no one could ever replace them. This movie is worth your money but I warn you. Bring tissues. You'll want them. To see 2 killed, 1 about to die, a burnt hand, a father who has a family so is a retired avenger, and now my favourite super hero is fat. This must be the end to the MCU and I hope that there isn't another avengers movie that replaces the OG avengers",positive
"If you don't want to cry so much while you are watching the movie, as there are some scenes that really broke my heart, maybe watch some spoilers can help you better taking in the final result.",positive
"It is the movie that I expected to see after 21 episodes that were shaping a great saga on the way. It's what I expected to see, after they've invested over $ 350 million doing it. And it's definitely what I was hoping to see to dramatically close a franchise that, in my opinion, should take a break so as not to saturate the genre.Although James Cameron deserves to be on the podium of the best of the film industry forever, if Endgame gets to surpass Avatar, it is deserved.This movie goes straight to my top 10 favorites movies of all time.",positive
"I watched Endgame in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!It may have taken 11 years, 21 films but Endgame finally has shown redemption Connecting and linking this movie with the past films is not easy and smart direction from Joe Russo and Anthony Russo. It is not only about superpowers but about love commitment, compassion and sacrifice. Tony Stark removes his ego and Steve Rogers finally got what he wanted.The only con of this movie was the running time. The three hours could have been scrapped or at least an interval to go to the loo.!My score= 8.5/10",positive
"Not being a Marvel-fan (nor DC by the way, which seems to be important to the fans) I liked it's direct prequel better. It's an ok movie really, but it had no surprises in it for me.",positive
This is a good movie but its not a typical marvel movie. i mean aren't you a fan of marvel because of all those crazy action sequences? but this movie have it less. this is more like a ending to the previous movies so dont except it to be as equal as infinity war interms of action but this movie have a lot of emotional scenes which you can get attached if you are marvel fan but if you are not then the first 2hours wont make much sense to you. as a marvel fan i can rate this movie 10/10 i even watched it two times but as a general audience this movie goes to either 7 or 8.,positive
"I want to give it 7/10 but +1 just for the potential of film makers who could present this conclusion.IW was just too perfect. Endgame must have been on the top of it, but sadly it is not.Despite of the difficulty to continue with the storyline after thanos' snap, this end is satisfactory.I think film makers should have taken one more part of Avengers to bring down the conclusion. This way they could bring more action to it.",positive
"So....boring. Bad CGI, lazy writing and just an all out disaster. Huge fan of the MCU, but this is the worst one by far.",negative
I won't put in spoilers just that I love Marvel and I was blown away by how amazing this movie was. Reached all my expectations and more. It deserves all the praise it's getting.,positive
So Avengers Endgame was the most epic Marvel movie I've ever seen it's a celebration of all the movies in the MCU leading up to Avengers Endgame and it was a walk down memory lane the entire movie and it's filled with references only people who have been around since the beginning will understand and get and yes it's 3 hours but every second of this movie is worth your time I've seen it now 3 times and still wanna see it AGAIN! I don't want to spoil anything but basically it's awesome!,positive

"Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic masterpiece and the best superhero film of all time. The epic finale of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga, the film brings together an incredible ensemble cast for a thrilling and emotional ride that will have audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish.The film perfectly balances humor, action, and heart, weaving together multiple storylines and characters seamlessly. The film hits all the right emotional notes, leaving us laughing, crying, and cheering in equal measure.It's no secret that the cast of Avengers: Endgame is one of the biggest draws of the film, and they do not disappoint. From Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark/Iron Man, to Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America, every actor brings their A-game, creating compelling characters that audiences have come to love over the years.The action sequences in the film are nothing short of stunning, with incredible special effects and choreography that keep audiences on the edge of their seats. But it's the film's emotional depth that sets it apart from other superhero films. Avengers: Endgame is ultimately a story of friendship, sacrifice, and hope, and it delivers a powerful message about the strength of the human spirit.In the end, Avengers: Endgame is an absolute triumph, a superhero film that not only stands as the best of its genre, but a film that transcends the superhero genre to become one of the greatest films of all time.",positive
"The film goes through alot of character's personal losess and world losses, and that kinda just drags on abit but they do try get the story in motion as goes along .Was expecting more from the battle's . And Thanos not being as strong as in Infinity War 🤔. Maybe because he was a few years younger but expected more from a big villain.
Avengers fighting together again as a team was good to see .
Captain America using Thor's hammer was rumoured because he's worthy.
But the ending lacked .... It's lacked the sense of edge of your seat battle . That part that was very close .. to all getting demolished - it kinda didn't feel the threat of Thanos as it did in Infinity War ,
Overall Good - but Expected Greatness",positive
"The movie is predictable but fun. It exists as a form of fan service. They ruined Thanos who was the best MCU villain so far. Killing him off in the beginning was not right. Also using him as a villain later felt abit forced. I wish they just brought back ultron or another villain in stead of reducing a well written villain to a generic villain. After all that story building in Infinity War, this is what they do to thanos?I was really hurt. But i understood that Endgame is an avengers movie while Infinity War was a Thanos movie. Why they couldnt ballance the two in the finally is beyond me.",positive
"Being a big fan of the Marvel Universe I was very disappointed to first sit through two hours of a very weird, boring and depressing Inception-like Movie.
They had a lot of good ideas but didn't manage to make it a good movie. If you can just skip the first two hours and watch the ending. I was so pissed when the good parts came that I had a hard time really enjoying them.",positive
"Just watched this in cinema today and i'm not disappointed. First few minutes were slow, but it gets very intriguing after that. Most of the action scenes come towards the end of the movie and they were very good, but I wish it had more or lasted longer. I felt the story was good and made sense, but there's probably some cliches or plot holes that I don't know about lol. It's a good movie, not the greatest movie ever like some people say, that's The Shawshank Redemption for me, but it's still one of the best action movies and worth a watch.",positive
"I went to go watch this movie on 04/27 and wanted to think on it before I decided to leave a review. I've never done a review, but I had to for this movie. This review will contain some spoilers.Pro's:The opening scene was great in my opinion. We pick up from where we left off, the survivors feel guilty for what happened and decide to go find Thanos.The moment between Thor and Captain Marvel was fitting. Two powerful beings recognizing one another.The emotional toll the audience feels from the aftermath of the snap 5 years later.Tony finally getting the family he always wanted.I am one of the few that thought that Nat's death was a satisfying conclusion. In the first Avengers she describes the way her and Barton met, and how she owed him a debt. She sacrificed her life because she knew Clint was going to get his family back.Tony seeing his dad.A few moments in the final fight scene. There were parts I did not like (Cap summoning lightning after Thor had restored his worthieness)Tony's death. I felt this was the only way that Marvel could continue without him. They couldn't just retire Tony because that is not who he is. It was fitting how Peter apologized and Pepper told him that it was okay to finally rest.Sam becoming Captain America. I know Bucky becomes the new Cap first, but with his Winter Soilder past, I think it is more appropriate for Sam to wear the stars and stripes.Con's:Fat Thor. I read up on it and apparently Chris Hemsworth and the directors really wanted to do this. I was not a fan of it. To me it just doesn't feel like something Thor would do. That's not the man that Odin raised him to be. I can understand being depressed and feeling guilty, but he wouldn't have turned his back on his people. I was expecting Thor to have a dream where he would talk to Odin and snap out of it and become the Thor from infinity war. Any time that Thor has ever felt unworthy, Odin had always been there to reassure him of his worth and power. I thought Thor was going to turn down Hulk and Rocket, have a dream about Odin, then show up at the Avengers facility looking like his old self. They built up Thor and finally did him justice in Infinity War. But then completely diluted his power from start to finish all for a few ""laughs"".Hulk. I thought the Professor Hulk had so much potential. He had the best of both worlds. Banner's intelligence and Hulk's strength, but instead they made him a pacifist. Ever since Avengers, they have slowly diluted his power and made him more of a joke.Cap. There is no way that Captain America abandons his duty and goes back to the past in order to hide. Wouldn't that mean that Bucky is still the Winter Soilder? Sam Wilsom never becomes the Falcon? Tony is still selfish and arrogant? Does he just watch all of the chaos from the past movies and shrug his shoulders and go back to his new life? It does not make sense to me. Marvel set up the perfect way to give Cap a chance at a family life with Sharron Carter.Thanos. Infinity War finally gave us a villain that we could understand and empathize with. There was a valid reason to his madness, however in Endgame they kill that Thanos and give us a one dimensional blood thirsty murderous Thanos. It was like a fleshy Ultron. Infinity War Thanos gave us emotion that no other villain gave us.Time heist. I am not going to even try explaining this. I tried to follow and once the movie comes out on DVD, then I will rewatch it and try to focus on the reasoning behind it. It left a lot of plot holes to me.Tony's funeral. I felt like it was rushed and I was really expecting to see a statue of Tony like Thanos hoped they would build for him.All in all I thought the movie had some really good moments and some really bad moments. I gave it 6/10 stars because I felt the good moments slightly outweighed the bad. I personally do not think it was a good enough wrap up to all of the films that came before it. I felt it was rushed and was made for the generation of fans that started watching the movies about 5 years ago. The fortnite scene made that pretty evident. I felt like they should have gone back and rewatched every movie in a weekend before even attempting to write a script. I felt like the energy that made those movies was not present in this movie. I know a lot of people will initially disagree with me, but go back watch all of Phase 1, 2, 3, especially Avengers, AoU, Infinity War, and then watch this movie. I promise you will not feel like it deserves 10/10.",positive
"This is a good movie in terms of all its technical background but there is a lack of feel and energy throughout the film except for the scenes towards the end. You just needs to sit and wait patiently for the final battle.
If you are a Marvel fan then you will enjoy it like any other Marvel films otherwise it can get sort of boring surely an overrated film.",negative

"Now I am going to put it out there that although I gave this a 10/10 it was not perfect. I enjoyed Infinity War more also. It was a great movie though, a true event and a worthy and somewhat emotional end to an epic saga. Yes, I know there will be other Marvel movies and who knows some of the old guard may return but it did kind of feel like a befitting end to many of the original characters. Thor and the Guardians were super fun, Hulk was the best he has been, Cap was truly stoic, for once I actually liked Hawkeye and Ant-Man was a laugh a minute. The plot made sense and although far fetched, who cares, most comics and superhero movies are. The action sequences were awesome also. My only gripe was that there was probably not enough action. The first couple of hours was bringing everyone together and giving us and many of the characters a chance to reminisce and feel the nostalgia. It really was at times moving and emotional especially Cap and Stark and their back stories. Then there was the final battle which was epic and moving end. Some characters cane full circle, some found happiness and some didn't and there was a set up for a few more movies and collaborations in the future. A truly great movie. I was hoping for better but at the same time was in no way disappointed. Avengers you will be missed but I have a feeling there might be more to come. The comic Avengers team have a wide and varied history and different versions of the team could keep reinventing the wheel. Will it be able to reinvent the magic, the chemistry and the love we have for this team though, I don't know. Thanks for the fun many happy memories to all involved in this franchise.",positive
"Marvel has completely taken over the film industry, and the addition of this film will speed up that process even more. This film is enjoyed the most when the audience is knowledgeable of the marvel cinematic universe and it enhances the emotions of the audience due to the bond forged through the commitment of watching all 21 films before Endgame. If someone were to ask me: ""Is it one of the best films you have ever seen?"" I would reply: ""It is the best film if all time, in its own way"" ""Its stands alone, away from every other film, because it is so different to anything i have ever watched before.""",positive

"For the past 11 years The Infinity Saga has closed its chapter with the Avengers: Endgame. After following the continuity of Avengers: Infinity War, our heroes comes once again to avenge both the previous characters who turned to dust and the other half of the universe who also turned to dust.Before going into this movie I was curious of why the movie was 3 hours long and answers are told literally in the first act of the film. After the Avengers discovered that Thanos destroyed the Infinity Stones, five years later we see what our characters are going through with they're loss, especially Hawkeye.As the film continue with the story, the final act of the movie is really indescribable. After the heroes managed to gather all the Infinity Stones and snapped everybody back alive, the final battle shows Thanos, his army and the Black Order going up against every Avengers team that are in this movie (except for the X-Men & Fantastic Four) and it really does feels like a ultimate fan service that had an amazing execution.For 11 years, it has been an adventure going into the MCU movies before the Infinity War and the Endgame. We've seen a lot of comic book movie starting with our main hero before we can get the chance of seeing them team up with the other Avengers because we want to feel and relate to these heroes before asking why should we care about the situation they're going through to save the world. So if your like me or everyone who's been following the MCU movies since day one, you will not be disappointed going into this movie.",positive
"I have never been the biggest MCU fan, but for the most part I have enjoyed all of the movies they have made. When I came into this movie I wasn't expecting anything that would blow my mind away and after watching the movie I feel like my prediction was correct.The biggest problem for me wasn't the time travel, or the plot holes that came from the time travel... My biggest problem with this movie was the out of place humor. I was expecting this movie to be a lot more serious and grounded, but instead we get Fortnite jokes and fat Thor. I am fine with jokes, but in a series movie like Endgame it just did not work with me. The first act of the movie was also very slow, but unlike most people I actually thought the first act was pretty entertaining. Another problem I had with the movie was when they were trying to find the Soul Stone. So Hawkeye and Black Widow both go to try and obtain the soul stone... Nebula knew that it takes a soul for a soul to obtain the stone, yet she doesn't say anything to the team. That is strong information not to share to Hawkeye and Black Widow, so that whole scene did not make any sense to me. Another problem with that scene was how they got the stone. To obtain the soul stone you have to sacrifice someone you love... they did not sacrifice each other, instead both of them were just trying to kill themselves.The movie had a lot of small errors, but it was still a very entertaining movie. The action in the movie was stunning along with the acting from Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. It's pretty obvious a lot of care and effort went into this movie, while also pleasing the fans. I would highly recommend going out and watching this movie.",positive
"After watching this, I must say that the film is a bit hyped up and not excellent as a lot of reviewers have given it, but is overall a good solid film.The first three quarters of the film was quite slow paced to be honest. I feel as though they should have distributed the action and tension scenes throughout the film rather than kept most of it for the final quarter. The last action scene seemed a bit rushed also but had some nice moments. There are plenty of comedic and fan service scenes throughout, but just lacked the tension, action and the banter scenes (especially the ones between Ironman and Dr Strange) that I had really enjoyed in the previous Infinity War film.Some vague spoilers below:There are occasional sad scenes, especially at the end, if you're a Marvel film fan or watched many of the previous ones, and it seems that they have finished off the Avengers franchise, or at least have killed off some of the main characters, which is sad. Saying that, they have opened up the doors to expand the Marvel universe.I found the sub- plot line, in which they have to retrieve the soul stone, a little silly to be honest. They have copied it from the previous one and how did the characters not know that a sacrifice is required?? Although it was nice to see some of the time travel scenes, I think the story would have worked much better if the time travel element was left out. That is my opinion though.Hope you enjoy the film though. 8/10.",positive
"Infinity War left the franchise on a new and unconventional path; Thanos WON, he wiped out half the universe, and he defeated the Avengers. And SPOILERS for the beginning of this movie; Thanos is killed, but not defeated, and he destroys the stones ASAP; the surviving Avengers CAN NOT fix it, leading up to a five year time gap. That was unexpected, and it's right at the beginning of the movie. Having seen the concept art for Endgame, I was expecting the finale to be the Avengers going to Thanos' home world, retrieving the stones, maybe having a few lose their lives, and everything being set back to normal. And spoilers, everything does get set back to normal (not really a spoiler; you seen the new Spiderman: Far from Home trailer? You think Disney are gonna leave their billion dollar money milking machine on a low note? NOT-REALLY-A-SPOILER, everyone and everything gets saved at the end). So the only enjoyment I got from this is how they were gonna fix everything, and as the end of the Avengers franchise as we know it, a time travel plot is cliche, but what else could they do really.I'm gonna say this up front, for an entire year, THIS IS WHAT I was betting would happen at the end of Endgame, which would have topped Infinity War; the Avengers would pull a Rick and Morty. SPOILERS for the Rick and Morty episode Rick Potion #9, Rick and Morty end up having to escape their reality and live in a different reality after they destroy the entire world. My bet for Endgame is that the Avengers would end up having a final battle with Thanos; but Thanos would defeat them again, and once again, use the stones and wipe out another half of the universe, forcing the surviving Avengers this time around to escape to another universe where everyone who died in their reality actually survived the finger snap in Infinity War. This could open up something great for the MCU; the introduction of the X-MEN and the FANTASTIC FOUR in the MCU now that Disney has purchased 20th Century Fox.What I think I loved most is seeing all these characters again one last time, the original Avengers, all making peace with their situations, and making amends. You understand their motivations, and you can sympathise with them in a world where their friends and family just died in the blink of an eye. You remember all the best interactions and all the best scenes from all the movies. Not everything your expecting to happen happens but I guess that's what makes the MCU more grounded and real than Hack Snyder's DCEU: There will always be things you wanna see, but sometimes, it just can't happen, or won't happen they way you want them to. Personally, I wanted Tony and Bucky to make amends and for Tony to forgive him (spoilers, doesn't happen), and I also would've preferred Bucky to become Captain America (spoilers, also doesn't happen), but the film still makes sure some expectations are met, and the one at the end is pretty damn satisfying.I remember seeing the trailer for Iron Man in 2008, and my first MCU movie was The Incredible Hulk, and I've watched every MCU movie since (except for Captain Marvel; I'm shocked that movie made over a billion, and even more surprised this bint got a movie before frigin BLACK WIDOW got her own movie). We all know that Endgame is the last appearance of both Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, and what I will say is they both have surprising endings in this, but other than that I won't spoil it. The MCU has been a great achievement in cinematic history, over 10 years of movies all tying in to each other, and a master class of world building and characters. This will probably never happen again: didn't work for DC, or the Universal Monsters; it hasn't even worked out for Star Wars.For those who have followed the MCU since 2008, this is a great conclusion to the world, the characters, and I would definitely recommend it.",positive
"As the title says. You know you have reached a dead end when you introduce time travel to resolve things. It works fine in shows that focus on it like Quantum Leap or Sliders but its usually a sign that you cant write worth a darn if you bring it into something else. That and alternate universes etc. They have been done to death and back and are just a plot device to overcome bad writing.So anyway, I still gave this a 5 because the CGI and fight scenes were fun. Unfortunately, that is about all there is to say about this movie. It was pretty hollow. The only source of comedy came with the introduction of smart hulk who was just funny conceptually more than anything else. Otherwise, I actually thought that this movie made all the other movies worse because... time travel...Its a shallow movie. Not worthy of its rating in the least.",negative
"Perfect conclusion to the 22 film saga satisfyingly wraps up several characters' multi-film arcs, while opening up possibilities for several others; that said, it's not without its faults, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly.",positive
"As a MCU movie and ending. I would give it 9.5/10The only things that i thought were missing was and badly needed:1) There were no scenes of the Hulk fighting. No World breaker Hulk or Hulk vs Thanos 2.0. That was very dissapointing.. I waited three hours for that, with no pay off.2) Fat Thor was funny, but at times to much. Making that much fun over PTSD and suvivors guilt was at times over the top. Thor should have got back in shape again after he retained Mjölnir. Regained the power of Thor.3) They should have killed of atleast one more character, raise the tention in the movie. Perhaps in the big battle.If thoses 3 things was fixed. It would have been the perfect end for me.",positive
It seems arbitrary to review a movie like this. It's not a movie it's a journey. I watched MCU movies over 5 years before this and it is a great conclusion. I can't say you'll love it and it's easy to nitpick but its good. Seeing it in the theater was an experience I will never get again. Sincerely recommended.,positive
We have witness something that we will never ever forget from marvels....,positive
"The marvel delivers a epic finale to avengers series. The years of build up and introduction of new characters definitely pays off . The farwell to some epic characters will definitely hit hard to every loyal marvel fan. The movie had its moments of action, laughter , sadness , togetherness and mindblowing climax. It wont be wrong to say the climax way up higher than the actual expectations. Despite its long run time of 3 hours it stills feels less for such kind of conclusion. The movie had its share of flaws but that does not lets you feel bored even for second. There are movies which are applauded for its story and peformances in the very highly recoginzed festivals around the globe unlike them this movie is itself a festival filled with memorable characters from the marvel cinematic universe. They are the characters who have such an impact that they will remain in the hearts of people for generations to come. This movie belongs to more of scifi or fantasy genre which are far from reality but the presentation of its imagination is delivered in such a way that you get sucked into its virtual universe. There are many series , sequels or combined universe movies who have actually failed to live up to its previous installment. Unlike them marvel universe continues to get bigger better and blockbuster with every passing follow ups. This movie is highly entertaining and enchancting equally to the fans as well as beginners. It definitely deserves a perfect score as it does its best in its own genre and movies as such will be not played be on screen every year. It might not be a masterpiece looking through a critical view but its more of a memory for a marvel fan .",positive
"Endgame follows on from the events of Infinity War which had possibly one of the most mind-bending cliffhangers in cinema history! I'm going to avoid spoilers on both films so very little plot details or characters arcs explained; just the comments on the structure and feelings it leaves with. It's the culmination of many Marvel storylines and has got to be one of the most anticipated films of all time for a loving fan base. It still manages to be surprising and my jaw dropped on many occasions; genuinely unexpected moments that are wonderfully done. It takes a lot of twists and turns with characters that really work and it's such a brave and exciting movie for doing so. It's running time is justified with the story taking place over three distinctive acts; the first very much focuses on grief, taking its well deserved time and exploring it and our heroes dealing with that. It's a really clever beginning as we see them at their most vulnerable and it reminds the audience that while being superheroes, they're also people with existential problems. The second act goes into more familiar territory and thrilling adventure, seeing a cool return from characters who missed out on the previous Avengers. The final act is just mind-blowing and delivers all that you could hope for from an epic series finale. There are a couple of character arcs that I understand why have frustrated some viewers although I personally found them laugh-out-loud funny as intended! There's also two character stories that are perfectly tied up and the past 12 years of Marvel films have a really beautiful ending here. It manages to not be all doom and gloom with a healthy dose of good humour while also having an emotional punch and some genuinely unbelievable set pieces. Huge congratulations to the entire team behind this project as it's just love for storytelling and spectacle embodied through cinema. It'll definately be even more rewarding on repeat viewings I think and I can't wait to see it again!",positive
"I just went to see the Avengers Endgame on Apr 25th, in Hawaii.First, I have to say......it was a good solid movie. However, it did not touch me or speak to me. I was not moved at all. The Infinity Wars, was far more emotional and gut wrenching, this one was just an attempt to change things up, do the unexpected, and try desperately to wrench our emotions.I will simply say that in this movie I was never mad, hurt, sad, or excited. No emotions this time.Some of the battles were epic, and some were hyped up and fizzled out quickly, and some battles just never happened. Some disappointing moments.Finally, when the battle was reaching a climax, and the home team got a chance to exact some revenge, things felt petty and predictable. Honestly, might have been better to follow the comic arc and stay true. Honestly, for the life of me, I do not know why I was not choked up in certain scenes when I should have been. Seems they were trying to hard to touch our hearts, and it felt disconnected.Three hours later......and had to wake my wife up several times which is usually a sign. She was wide awake in Infinity Wars, beginning to end.So if you just looking for revenge or a reckoning, congratulations.....you got it. But if you are looking for real emotional struggles and happy reunions......mehhhhhh......they tried....some were decent.I will not give any spoilers, but I will say I am flat out angry because my favorite character of all time, since I was a child, did not fight! Seriously, WTF?! And after what happened in Infinity Wars, it makes no sense.",positive
"I have never given a 10/10 to a superhero film since the first Avengers film wayyy back in 2012. This movie is not perfect obviously (1. Some jokes fell flat and some of it i felt just appeared at the wrong time 2. Some songs i felt were placed or played at the wrong time too 3. Some people might have a problem with the pacing of the first act but i personally loved the slow pace), but this movie doesnt need to be perfect and there are obviously better superhero films in terms of quality like Captain America: Civil War, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Logan, The Dark Knight and so on but come on man. Those movies are great movies but Avengers: Endgame is magic/one-of-a-lifetime-event!Never have i once laughed, cried, cheered and screamed this much in a movie. I have also never thought i could get this much of a rewarding experience from rewatching all 21 MCU films. WOW! Thank you Marvel Studios for this experience!See it without any spoilers, i beg you!",positive
"For me personally this film was just too darned long. As I sat watching it I suddenly realised against all hope and expectation that I was actually a little bored - a feeling I never got from its predecessor.Visually it's stunning (as you'd expect) and I can see how to a great many people it has the ultimate wow factor but for me it doesn't quite hit the spot.Personally I'm struggling to put it in my top 3 MCU movies.I definitely prefer Infinity War and Guardians Of The Galaxy and then it's a toss up between this, Civil War, The Winter Soldier and Ragnarok.",positive
A complete let down as they tried to turn End Game into some family comedy bit. They should have stopped at Infinity War.,negative

"What can I say but ""Thank you, Marvel""?I really recommend you to watch all MCU movies before Endgame, because they make this experience unique for the fans that is with them since the beginning.About the movie, I'm thinking for a long time to write an adjective, but the only one I can think for now is ""wordless"".I had never seem something like this, even in Infinity War (which I thought it was insurmountable) we didn't watch such a deep and emotional movie like I just watched in Endgame.All characters have a great end in the film. I can say that them fulfilled the role just the way it should be. We don't see individual throughts, but a team working together to save what they love more.It was a pleasure to be part of this, because all of us has something in these Marvel movies. Maybe grateful is the word to discribe the feeling right now. I claped my hands when the screen turns black and I know that a lot of fans, like me, did the same!Thank you, Marvel for the Gran Finale.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is complicated, yet satisfactory. It has issues, but hits key goals. First, Endgame explores the aftermath of Infinity War, solidifying its impact and earning the ensuing redemption. Next, the time heist is convenient, but effectively reflects on the franchise and develops core characters. Lastly, the finale is excessive, but that's what the masses want. Plus, its prelude fight between Thanos and the three core Avengers is exciting. Power levels are inconsistent, the climax gets desensitizing, and the plot is clunky, but Endgame finishes with emotional closure. Because drama is strategically emphasized, Endgame ultimately overcomes its flaws.Technically, Endgame isn't as cohesive as Infinity War, but still succeeds. Visually, there are extended shots, overheads, and conscious composition. The editing is cumbersome, but manages a massive scope. The sound isn't as symbolic and the music isn't as restrained, but both still contribute. Meanwhile, the production design of the finale is noticeably colorless. This was likely an attempt at a gritty atmosphere, but it's mostly just unsightly. However, the effects are extensive (though CGI heavy) and the cast is amazing. Plus, the acting is touching. Overall, it's a downgrade from Infinity War, but Endgame still offers plenty.Writing: 7/10

"Watching the coming attractions was depressing. No wonder kids are half brain-dead today. My only interest in anything Avengers is Benedict Cumberbatch. I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable. Special effects were amazing, but for about a half hour there I felt like I was watching a video game.Thought the script managed to have some poignancy and humor as well. And you have to see it in a theater.",positive
"If AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR is the MCU's EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, then ENDGAME is more than their RETURN OF THE JEDI, for it is one of the most emotionally satisfying payoffs in movie history, one that is truly bittersweet in the best way possible. We knew that there would be a final reckoning with Thanos if his ""Snapture"" was to be reversed, and this showdown would surely require sacrifice, that if there was to be a happy ending for anybody, it would likely not be a happy ending for everybody. That said, when the credits rolled after nearly three hours, and all the heroes and villains fates had been revealed, it was not sadness that I felt, but gratitude for a job well done, and a story well told.ENDGAME is not a repeat of its predecessor, it does not race from one great epic set piece battle to another, instead its focus, at least in the first two hours, is on the surviving characters, and how they grapple with their failure to stop the Mad Tyrant from wiping out half of all living creatures in the universe, and their inability to move on from this loss. The movie is not afraid to confront this grief head on, and really let these characters that we have come to know so well, drive the story. But when the time comes for a big action throw down, ENDGAME delivers.Anybody who has watched the trailers knows that Scott Laing and the Quantum Zone figure prominently in the plan to undo Thanos's carnage; it does involve time travel, but it does not take the standard comic book and movie trope of going back and changing the past in order to change the present, a refreshing change. What has been done cannot be erased, but through some deft maneuvering, it can be reversed. So what we get is both a time travel movie and a heist film, where Captain America, Tony Stark, a worse for the wear Thor, and the rest of the surviving Avengers go back to significant points in previous MCU films and surreptitiously lift the all powerful Infinity stones from right under the noses of their former selves. Of course no plan goes smoothly, there are complications that require improvising, and along the way, Thanos and his many minions become wise to what is happening, setting his own counter plan in motion, and putting everyone on a collision course. Robert Redford, Tilda Swinton, John Slattery, and Frank Grillo all make pertinent cameos in roles we saw them play in earlier films, and a fateful glimpse Steve Rogers gets of Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter proves to be pivotal for his character, same for an encounter Tony Stark has with his father in the past. One of the joys of this movie is seeing how seamlessly the plot uses what has come before to build a final resolution.It is the character arcs of the two great heavy hitters, Captain America and Iron Man, that are at the center of ENDGAME; Steve Rogers and Tony Stark have come a long way during the course of MCU, and we have come to understand that they are truly brothers, part of a family whose common bond is an unbreakable desire to do the right thing, to use the enormous power they have been endowed with to protect their fellow men no matter what the cost to themselves, to take any blow from any foe, to rise again, and again, no matter how many times they are knocked down, and find a way to win. The decision to cast Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. in these parts was the equivalent of picking Sean Connery to play Bond.But there is so much more to ENDGAME than just Cap and Iron Man. There is Professor Hulk; Korg on the couch playing video games; the many ages of Scott Laing; finding out that Doctor Strange was right; ""Hail Hydra"" and that winking nod to one of the most polarizing comic book story lines of the past decade; how Gamora and Loki get back into the MCU; seeing the Ebony Maw again; the image of The Hulk holding up a mountain of debris on his back just like he did in that issue of Secret Wars from the 80's; and Thor meeting his deceased mother in Asgard. Then there is Hawkeye and The Black Widow on Morag, where one of them will have to make the ultimate sacrifice, for me, this is the most emotional scene in the movie beside the final battle. This might be the best work Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson have ever done. And of course, that final battle itself is everything I could have wanted, where there are heartfelt reunions and heart breaking farewells.There is no post credit scene, which to me was a little disappointing, but it's probably the right move, as it puts a period on this phase of the MCU, and underscores that we will never again see all of these actors in these roles together in one film. But if there is no hint at what is to come, there is more than enough left on the table, personally I cannot wait for the next GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY with Thor as part of the crew; Chris Hemsworth has proven himself to be amazingly, and surprisingly, funny in the part. Maybe they could finally tackle the Secret Wars story line or the Korvac Saga; after the recent merger with Fox, there is the likelihood that we will see the X-Men brought into the MCU proper. The story possibilities are endless, personally, I'd like to see somebody adapt The Young Avengers, and bring the group into the 21st Century.So thank you to Kevin Feige, and the Russo Brothers, for pulling it all off, for giving us an epic that will resonate for years to come; and thank you as well to Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and all the rest who came together back in the day to create a world of super heroes who were as human as the readers who bought their books. This adult who was once a kid who couldn't get enough of Marvel comics is forever in awe of what all of you have done. ""And I...am... Iron Man.""",positive
"#MCUrewatch. This is the big one. It all led to this: the big finale of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is epic filmmaking at its best. The original Avengers shine.

But, in revisiting the previous movies, also a fitting reward for the fan of this franchise. More then 10 years and 20 films. One overarching story. It is a mammoth achievement in film history.",positive
"I have a strong sentimental attachment for the MCU. I watched the movies for 11 years, and this was almost like a breakup for me. Infinity War was one of my best movie experiences, i was beyond shocked, exited and emotional. And happy, beacause no movie of the mcu has accomplished that in me, and was because the bad guy wins (happy endings got boring honestly), all those uncomfortable one-line jokes and witty remarks were few, all the encounters and character development were meaningful and wonderful set, and the battles, my god, the battles were so epic, so imginative and so so great. all of what this movies lacks. it´s 3hrs of pure emotion, with a bad written story and not particularly appealing visuals. It seems as if they went with the first draft of the scrpit. i can´t understand all the glory this movie gets. I feel very ripped off",positive

"No, this is not a movie review. No spoilers, so relax. This is a eulogy. Because, with Marvel's Infinity War: Endgame, a long and wonderful relationship comes to an end, and I give it a fond, sad, farewell.The Marvel Cinematic Universe kicked off in 2008 with Iron Man, but my Marvel universe started way before that, in 1961. I was a pointy headed kid living in Lawton, Oklahoma when I bought my very first Marvel title, The Fantastic Four #1. It wasn't my first comic book purchase: I already owned several issues of Our Army At War featuring Sergeant Rock, GI Combat with The Haunted Tank, some assorted DCs like Batman and Green Lantern, but all those were random purchases prompted by the cover or the opportunity, except for the Haunted Tank, which was sort of an ongoing series so I picked it up whenever it appeared on the spinning rack o' comics in Carl's Drug Store (which appears to now be Carl's Military Supply). Buying comics and bubble gum baseball cards was standard early-60s kid behavior. But Marvel changed things.See, Marvel was different. DC ruled the comic book world with Superman and Justice League and Wonder Woman, but there was something a bit off about them. Take Superman: despite DC's strenuous efforts to put some drama in his stories, he was Superman. No one's going to beat him. And Batman was always going to win and Robin was interesting but looked more like he got in the way than anything. Actually, I preferred lesser DC titles like Blackhawk and Tales of the Unexpected and the aforementioned war comics. But the Fantastic Four...they didn't WANT to be super heroes! And they bickered with each other and screwed things up and, what the heck? They were, like, real people.So I bought Marvel from that point on almost exclusively, with exceptions here and there like those quirky Charleton Comics. Besides Fantastic Four, I collected Two Gun Kid, the Rawhide Kid, Ghost Rider (the cowboy, not the motorcycle flame head), and Sergeant Fury and His Howling Commandos. Cowboys and war, yep, that was my thing. And then Captain America showed up.I knew who he was. Every Marvel kid in the 60s knew him because he was referenced here and there, but we didn't actually see him until Avengers #4, where he unthaws and joins the team. [NOTE: I may have seen him earlier in the November 1963 Strange Tales, but I can't remember]. And then he showed up in various Howling Commandos titles and I was gobsmacked. This guy, this Steve Rogers was pure of heart and filled with angst and a man out of his time and a hero. He became my favorite character and the Avengers became my favorite team. Yes, I loved X-Men and Daredevil and Thor and everything else Marvel, too, but Cap and the Avengers were the gold standard.Throughout my rather traumatic 60's childhood, Cap and the Avengers and Marvel were my refuge. When things got bad, I had my trusty pile of comics buried deep in the closet and I could get lost. Heroes had problems, too, heroes suffered; Spiderman lost Gwen Stacy and Cap lost his entire team and had to put up with smart alec Hawkeye and former enemies Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. If he can put up with stuff like that, then I'd be alright. But at the end of 1969, my family blew up and, over one very bad day and night, I lost all my comics. Among a lot of other things. I was right in the middle of an Avengers arc involving Namor kidnapping the Wasp and Powerman invading Avengers HQ. I never finished that story. To this day.Then it was the 70s and I was in a completely new place and lost interest in galactic level heroes like the Avengers and turned to street level fighters like Shang Chi and Iron Fist and that wondrous Tomb of Dracula, until it was time to put away childish things and I no longer read comics. With exceptions. I did Cloak and Dagger and the entire Adam Warlock Infinity Gauntlet series, but the 80's was different and that Marvel wasn't mine anymore. Move on.And then it's 2008 and Iron Man and the rest of the movies start, and I was six years old again.Sure, the movies were vastly different from the 1960s storylines and characters, but that was okay. The directors and the writers gave props to tradition, like Tony's first bulky iron suit, Thor slipping on the Donald Blake coat, SpiderMan's wrestling career, and I was thrilled. Look at this, my entire childhood revived in spectacular CGI color and glory. I loved it, even the Ben Affleck Daredevil. I could forgive much for the pleasure of reliving past joys.
But it was all heading somewhere, and when Doctor Strange said, ""We're in the endgame now,"" he meant a lot more than you know. The 1960s was turning into the 70s and 80s again, culminating in this last movie, this last Marvel gasp. Captain America is gone. So is Tony. My original beloved Marvel characters have become dust. Move on.Oh, sure, there's still Spiderman. The next movie has Mysterio, and there's hints of the Sinister Six at some future point. Guardians of the Galaxy still has Adam Warlock bundled away somewhere, and the next Doctor Strange and animation Shang Chi looks good. But those are all novelties, like visiting your hometown forty years after leaving. Things just ain't the same.So rest in peace, boys and girls. Excelsior.",positive
"As expected this movie is above all theories and expectations. Who could have thought that this movie have such a great plot. It is something unexpected. The only think I observed wrong is the nature difference of two Thanos. Infinity War's Thanos was Smart, Knowledgeable and this one though smart but is very cruel. This one only wants disasters. Else is good especially Thorrrr😍😍.",positive
You don't need any review to watch this one buddy. 😂😂😂,positive
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a satisfying, expertly made sequel in the franchise and combines with ""Infinity War"" to create the MCU's best, most compelling storytelling. I think that this movie raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it as it stands out as one of the most detailed, satisfying conclusions to a chapter in a long-running franchise. All the necessary heroes get the right amount of screen time and there is a great blend of grief and humor. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a beautifully-constructed piece of popcorn cinema and anyone who has given their time to this world will find it to be a rewarding and effective payoff. The word epic is the right one for this movie. The end. nikisreviews.gr",positive
"The wrap-up to last's year Infinity War is a satisfying wellspring of closure to many of our Marvel faves as the battle against Thanos & his minions to save the universe & perhaps restore the lost lives that were disappeared when the snap heard around the universe was instituted. Not going into the outcomes of some characters or mucking about in spoilers, this effort by the Russo brothers is gargantuan in scope & intent as multiple storylines through 22 separate films comes to a head. Whether you come from your screening satisfied or frustrated, you must give heed to the Herculean effort attempted & accomplished. This is surely a film for the ages.",positive
I didn't like the acting. Thanos doesn't seem like the badass of the first movie,positive

"Well...after the depression one was left with after the Infinity War ended...This will make you clap your hand! Oops! I fear I might have mentioned too much! 3 hours it may be, but you will enjoy it. Make sure you go to the loo first before the movie start. Oh yes, if you are waiting for the credit scenes to roll...don't bother.",positive
"It is a daunting task to wrap up a magnum opus called The Avengers involving numerous heroes who have become a part of ourselves and engineered permanent seats for themselves in our hearts. It is somewhat successful in its pursuit of providing the conclusion the franchise deserves although I would have been more satisfied if they would not have ventured on the time travel route.Like other time-travel movies , this film also suffers from numerous plot inconsistencies. Time travel is an enigmatic phenomenon not only for laymen but for scientists as well. Hence, it is bound to create issues when integrated into a film.The film's treatment of Thanos is an utter disappointment. He has been reduced from a stoic visionary to a shallow formulaic ruthless villain completely disrespecting his massive character development in Infinity war. Hulk was yet another low point of the film. I believed firmly that Hulk was going to take a major role against Thanos in EndGame but instead we get 'Professor Hulk' who did not go bonkers even over Natasha's death. Thor who is aware of personal losses suddenly decides to become a despondent loner. Let us not forget that his mother, brother, his men were all snatched from him but he never strayed from the path of retribution. This was a major disservice done to his character arc.Natasha's death does not qualify to be a sacrifice as Clint was insistent on saving her from falling to her death and negates the Vormir events in Infinty war. Ironman was given a martyr's death just because his contract has expired. Instead he should have taken up the role of mentor for New Avengers and made occasional appearances. ""God's righteous man- a man out of time"" Captain America succumbed to his desire for getting a normal life which is not digestible for a Cap fan. He should have died a valiant death and that would have given an honorable and befitting end to the life of such an amazing magnanimous persona. Unforgivable disservice was done to his character given the fact that he left the New Avengers in the lurch with 2 down, 1 retired and one severely injured.Dr. Strange's entire plan was based on the mere chance that a rat presses the keys securing Antman's escape from Quantum realm. Thus, the plot faltered right from the word 'Go'.The war sequence was well-made but too many heroes at some points made it incoherent at times. A bit of daylight would have sufficed as in earlier Avengers movies.Endgame gives us a scenario of a post-apocalyptic world and the principal cast have given their best marvel performances till date depicting their trauma, their agony and their desperation. The lengthy first half sets this up very well and creates a profound impact on the audience. CGI was top notch as usual. The background score blended well with the different moods. References to previous movies really moved me.Overall, the film does have its moments in both halves but can't dethrone Winter Soldier, Infinity war, Civil war as three of my personal MCU favorites because of their atypical superhero movie plots which stands out from the rest.",positive
"Frank Capra had a golden rule - a movie can be many things but the number one sin is boring. Endgame - wanted to like it, spent money to like it, and .... boring. long, talkative and not worth the time. 2 hours would be fine, stretched to 3. Comedy was good mostly but not the padding. Long long intro shots of this and that. It finally hit the gold standard of DC. It took itself way way too seriously. So I am disappointed and sad. About right up there with Star Trek - The Motion Picture for boring. I don't like writing this, but ....... boring.",negative

Best film i've ever seen. I need to go and watch this 1 more time😍😍JUST PERFECT❤
Thank you Marvel❤",positive
"I love marvel movies. They aren't always the greatest movies, they are usually really good, but they are always fun. To tie all the stories together, develop these characters, create emotional connection, and still be fun and entertaining is no small task. Lost couldn't even end a couple of seasons on an island. This crosses time, reality, and space and yet still is a wonderfully satisfying conclusion to 22 films. Wonderful. Simply wonderful. Though why am I writing this? Is there really someone deciding whether or not to watch the epic conclusion to these movies based on an IMDb review?",positive
"I don't even know how many times I said ""you are KIDDING ME!"" out loud, in the theater! It was a LOT of movie for the price of the tickets. So much closure, so many laughs, and also some tears. I don't think any movie will ever be as worth seeing ever again. Thank you, Marvel, for an incredible story. Just perfect.",positive
"A great ending to the phase 3 of MCU. The film's climatic battle is way better then any of
the battle in infinity war and more emotionally charged than its predecessor. The background score was tremendous with equally good cinematography. People who rate low emphasis more on plot holes and goes way more technical than required. A film's job is to provide entertainment to its audience which it does satisfies.",positive
"I love this movie. Even though it Iis quite sad in some areas, they could still fit it some jokes.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is an action-packed and heartwarming conclusion to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga. The movie is a rollercoaster ride of emotions that will keep audiences at the edge of their seats from start to finish.The film features an all-star cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and more, who all deliver powerful performances that will leave viewers on the brink of tears. The action sequences are some of the best in the MCU, with breathtaking special effects and epic battles that will leave audiences cheering.Despite the film's intense action, it also manages to be heartwarming and filled with moments of humor and camaraderie between the characters. Watching the Avengers come together to fight for what they believe in is truly inspiring, and the film's message of hope and unity is one that resonates deeply with audiences.However, be warned, the film's ending is a sad one that will leave many viewers feeling emotional. While it may not be the ending that fans were hoping for, it is a fitting conclusion to the Infinity Saga and a testament to the incredible storytelling that has made the MCU so beloved.Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a must-see for any fan of the MCU or superhero movies in general. It's an epic conclusion to an incredible journey that will leave viewers feeling satisfied, but also a little bit sad that it's all over.",positive
"Thor almost killed thanos in the last movie, and thanos had infinite stones with him.
In this movie Thor could not even hit a thanos without the stones.
The Marvel girl blown away thano's spaceship in 1,2seconds, but could not even hit thanos
Iron man, without his helmet, took a direct hit in the face and everything was ok.Allll right, let me stop. They could have done better",positive
"This movie provides us everything we ever wanted.
People who think the plot was messed up should know that The time travel made complete sense. The Russo's very convincingly
Used the theory of multiple parallel realities which was hinted quite a few times in the Ant-Man and Doctor Strange franchise movies.
Each of the original six avengers got their deserving screen time in the conclusion of the saga they started.
It was incredibly emotional yet funny. It gave fans pride, surprises and chills all the time. If you haven't yet seen the movie, you can never imagine what happens.
Killing thanos within the first 5 minutes, who could've imagined that. It also sets up the phase 4 of the MCU and is making the audience impatient for the next movie (Far From Home) to understand the consequences of the death of Tony Stark and Romanoff which was devastating but left their marks on each of our's hearts forever.
The final battle with the original six and the ressurected heroes made every marvel fan cry.
It was truly satisfying and unforgettable.
It was lovable 3000.",positive
I enjoyed certain parts . But admit I left the cinema feeling meh. Thought the pacing was off took too long to get into its stride. relegated Thor and hulk to comedy sidekick roles. And seemed to get itself all confused in the time travel storyline. Was hoping for better.,positive
Let's see ... we can't write a decent story or come up with anything original any more. So let's just throw every character ever conceived of into a giant mashup & that'll make a great movie! Right? WRONG!!,negative
"This movie was set up brilliantly by infinity war. The suspense the ending and the direction was all up to the mark. The cast delivers perfectly. Some of the theories used in the movie create plot holes which are well taken care of. Some of the parts of the movie is not well explained. It is a lot to grasp at the first watch. I thought that Robert Downey Jr performed brilliantly. The movie clocks well over 3 hours, but in the end keeps you wanting more. It opens up a wide future for the MCU to take shape into. It lives up to the hype. I felt that some of the cast members deserved more screen time.
Otherwise you can put it up well with the best superhero movies of all time.
If not the best.",positive
"Best way to describe a three hour venture without recklessly diving into spoiler territory. The movie excels best at its central element of time travel, which is rather where the momentum is truly its natural best. The characters are all rounded, perhaps more so here than Infinity War. This is likely a fair take on what results now as a quadrilogy than a trilogy. When the action really gets to its peak level, it's almost effortless with the buildup doing every bit of the talking. The most curious turnout is the studio's first ever movie to be well over three hours, which to be frank could have succeeded with more than the overall result in this movie. Just a thought at hand, rest assured the pacing eventually comes to a fitting close that won't underwhelm the overall theme of what's termed the Infinity Saga. The emotion and depth really get to how things play out, also a bit improvised over Infinity War and in the viably greater ways. Got to lose a point for how it uses fan service done right as a sendoff to breeze through the buildup process up to the key parts that make this movie the ultimate conclusion it will be for a long time. My favorite of the Russo brothers' directed movies remains Civil War, simply because it was a Captain America movie of all the flicks back then that really pushed hard to reach a well deserved billion mark. This might get there a little too easily. Duh, but noteworthy. Give or take eleven years and twenty two movies, which as I mention is twice its bargain. Facing Thanos the second time really says something, which is likely all to consider about it.",positive
"After the events from Infinity War, for those who survived life has not been easy, but make the best of what they can, until Ant Man comes in the picture, has the equipment to time travel, so they all make a plan to go back in time and get the stones before Thanos does, but the question is will they succeed?
The best of all marvel movies, everybody gives a great performance, in my opinion nobody really stands out. It's a three hour film, but sure doesn't feel like it, so well paced. Effects are excellent, also don't disappoint. For all Marvel fans, please don't miss this.",positive
"I gave infinity war a 4 out of 10 for a variety of reasons. But the main reasons were that the ending wasn't conclusive even for an MCU film, and the villain's goal seemed extremely contrived. His goal even seems ridiculous to me within the realm of typical superhero villain motives.I felt annoyed that no hero character ever tried to intellectual argue with Thanos about his plans. No one ever asked why Thanos he couldn't try to use the infinity stones to make more resources rather than fewer inhabitants. Or why he felt that every planet was identical to his home planet in needing half their inhabitants to die, given the evidence of each planet have distinct differences problems.Nevertheless, I like the story idea of half of the main characters dying and needing to be saved by the other half. I just felt that a more unhinged villain or an accident could have been a better excuse for such a mishap occurring and needing to be resolved in Endgame. I was especially annoyed at the point when they nearly had the glove off Thanos before losing focus.But luckily Endgame is about solving the problems of Infinity War, and that story is a lot more fun and acceptable. Even if it involves time travel, at least none of the characters act buzzards like the physics of this alternate world.Endgame is the longest MCU film at just over 3 hours. But for me it only feels slow in a couple places.The story also provides some great reminiscing by reuniting all of the original Avengers and eliminating quite a bit of the clutter of so many characters within the last film. Only Ant-Man, Rocket, and Nebula really join the original 6 Avengers characters for the bulk of this film. The film's smaller cast allows for some more focus and growth for Tony Stark, Thor, Hulk, Hawk-eye and others as they each deal with their new normal differently.Even though the film turns out to be a time-travel movie, it also doesn't try to be like the typical time travel movie where changing the past impacts the present and future.The writers use time-travel more as an opportunity to scavenge things from the past and bring them to the present. It's sort of like the past is an alterable mirror reality they they discovered how to interact-with. This does lead to one annoyance for. The writers seem to disregard this narrative near the end when they decide that they must return the stones to where they took them. But overall I excuse this inconsistency because the sequence where they go back in time is very fun and provides for an interesting unexpected conclusion in the end.Like other Avengers movies the dialogue is often funny and the cinematography, music and acting are great.Overall I also given the film bonus points for really being a different kind of action movie then I ever thought I'd ever see. And I appreciate them deciding to not feel obliged to keep all of the characters alive forever. I like even good epic stories to eventually have some endings and conclusions. And the writers seemed to understand that in endgame.Overall it's a great ride. And I imagine if it's watched immediately after Infinity War it might make both films collected average about a 7 out of 10. I just with the infinity war would have been as good as Endgame. That would have really been something special.",positive
"A masterful epic - a true culmination of 22 films that not only concludes the story, but expands upon it. You'll learn more about the other movies while this one unfolds. If Infinity War is the brawn, Endgame is the brains. And wow, what an ending!",positive
"Avengers Endgame to me is the very best MCU film to date. Not only because of the decade of buildup we had to this chapter but also the incredible acting and action! Everyone is on their A-game here and they are committed to it fully.The action is also amazing! While it does take a while to get to it, when it does happen, it puts a smile on my face every time I see it.It also represents how far comic book films have come. While there were certainly good ones before, this one shows how well they can be done and that they are worth seeing on the biggest screen. It also serves as a fantastic celebration of these characters and tribute to the comic book world.Even someone like me who never really got into comic books growing up, these movies are greatly digestible for anyone who is unfamiliar with them and are always fun to watch.Overall, Avengers Endgame is my favorite MCU I've seen.",positive
"I would like to start by saying I'm a huge MCU fan. I completely get why people love this movie! it's a fun, end to a adventure that has been a part of many peoples lives for a long span of time. It is a great movie however it escapes me how people can watch this movie and not see huge flaws with the it. The best thing I can say is stuff just doesn't make sense.*Stuff in shots that isn't there in the next shot. *Simple story explanations were not present.
*overall the story felt bland actually.With that said, overall you will have a good time watching the movie.",positive
"Walking into the theater, my knees were shaking. The beginning scene when Clint's family dusted was just jaw dropping and gave you chills. The plot was a genius idea. People predicted that they went back into time but they added a ton of new things in the plot that was shocking like black widows death for the stone. The final battle was not enjoyable if your not a marvel fan. They ended each character just the way they shouldve ended. This movie is an easy 10/10.",positive
"Starts out dreary - I understand why it's gloomy, what with half the population gone, but since I didn't actually emotionally commit to care about the snap last Avengers movie, it's a big 'meh' for me.There are some nice jokes to keep you entertained, especially those involving time travel, throughout the movie. Also some entertaining action scenes.But the ending is an overstuffed CGI fest like any other superhero movie. Cheap, pretentious ""philosophy"" to make this movie appear to have depth (which it doesn't). Some left-field character ""development"". And, boy, did I hate the whole Rogers x Carter ending - seriously, that was just gross after he went with her grandniece in Civil War.All in all, I felt like the entire series ended in a whimper, because the last two Avengers movies were just overstuffed. To be honest though, IMO the only Avengers movies out of the 5 made that were well-done were The Avengers and Civil War - all the others felt overstuffed and the ""solo"" movies, where only a few characters pair off, are often better.",positive
"The storyline being absolutely terrible is almost unrepairable. However, they do try and fail. The bjg problem is it's finally clear the choppiness and flow are off due secrecy and too much outsourcing. In order to obacure the plot, different companies are awarded different CGI scenes without ever being told the whole enchilada so that they can't leak anything... Of course this method requires there to be a very strong movie plot to begin with or you end up with chop suey. This movie has a few moments of good laughs and one liners... And that's it. It's a total and complete failure.",negative
"Following the events of infinity war the avengers are all feeling the loss. They all have this sense of failure and are dealing with it in different ways but when a new possibility comes to life the avengers reassemble to try their hand again at stopping Thanos.This movie did a really good job of making these characters feel human. The loss that they all suffered really shows their emotional sides and how each one of them deals with grief. This is one of the best parts of the film.The storytelling can be a little wonky at times and there are quite a few plot holes but overall the story is great. They keep you intrigued by keeping this sense of urgency and this sense of last chance which is what keeps you interested. This movie is definitely paced as well as infinity war was, there are a fair amount of slow parts but a lot of it was needed.The visuals in this movie are phenomenal and the people working in them need to be given props because this would have been a task to accomplish. The amount of things going on in these action scenes is insane so the that they were able to manage it so well was impressive. Much like endgame each character is given their moment and play a important role which is hard to do in a movie of this scale.This is very much a conclusion to the last 10 years prior and they do a great job of rapping up certain storylines but also paving the way for future films. It puts you on a roller coaster of emotions and really shows how much these characters mean to the audience.Overall I loved this movie and I think they rapped it up perfectly. The task they set out to accomplish was huge and they some how pulled it off. So, props to everyone involved and thank you for creating something that many of us never dreamed would happen.9/10.",positive
"I've just returned from watching Avengers: Endgame on opening night.
As a fan of Marvel for over three decades I had many expectations and thoughts about what this movie might bring, and this movie was nothing that I expected.
It brought us both the best (and worst in my opinion) versions of Earth's mightiest heroes. And I'm sure that many out there will disagree with me on which is which.
What is undeniable is that the Russo's have managed to achieve what many (including myself) thought impossible, to deliver a film which pays tribute to the past decade's 21 (not including Endgame itself) Marvel Cinematic Universe offerings, whilst simultaneously closing out the story lines and creating an epic masterpiece in itself.
It has humour (some of good), action, emotion and genuinely something for everyone all rolled up into an epic three hours of entertainment, which goes by in a flash. Well done, fantastic work.Thanos, it's Hammertime!",positive
"This is a great hilarious movie, there are so many funny jokes and references to other movies and old characters returning, Great introductions to characters but way too long, it's 3 hours and the goal isn't clear, the whole point in what they're trying to do keeps on changing and I'm really disappointed with Black Widows death, Tony Stark's death and Caps retirement, I don't feel comfortable with Falcon taking on the role of captain America, and it gets a little boring from time to time and at one point your just waiting the movie to end but great cameos and use of time travel, I love the way they recap on almost every great past movie but I was expecting a little more from this movie I think the deaths and changes are a little too much for me but great movie in general.",positive

"It took Tony Stark one day to discover time travel? why not introduce the idea of time travel at the beginning then have tony stark develop and perfect time travel with the 5 year gap? that seems more reasonableThe ruined remains of society cannot be bothered to sweep the streets and remove abandoned cargo ships from the harbor after 5 years, but there was enough coordination and planning to create a memorial site of everyone who passed away?? (then I presume a dedicated committee/staff to maintain the memorial site grounds?)Why not use the time stone to just reverse time before the snap? Instead of traveling back in time and having to get every single stone. With the knowledge from the present, they could prevent the infinity war by just going back in time and destroying at least one infinity stone. the initial problem was their strategy; it was defensive by ""protecting the stones"". it should have been offensive. they now understand that at least one stone would need to be destroyed. how? well that's for the writer's of the movie to decide. SW cannot be the only person in all of MCU who has the power to destroy the stone. perhaps an opportunity to introduce an OMEGA mutant). either way, this scenario makes more sense than finding all the stones and then somehow magically making a new gauntlet.someone was arguing against reversing time because Stark did not want to change the present (ie Morgan). Ok, If that's the case, then he is still selfish. he would rather lose vision, gamora, and unknowingly BW in the process of obtaining the infinity stones? In addition, he dies himself. So 4 preventable deaths AT LEAST. this really negates his so called ""self-sacrifice"". He could still get married and have a child after correcting the events of infinity war. No sympathy for an un-evolved Tony Stark.There were some moving scenes (many occurring during the time travel segment) and I enjoyed the final battle. But there were far too many plot holes. I'm surprised ""die hard"" fans are incapable of critical thinking skills. I've watched youtube channels by devoted fans just to gain perspective but they're too caught up in the moment to critique it technically as a film.",positive
"Wow, this film is a superb culmination of every single Avengers film.
You possibly could've seen more of Captain Marvel but seeing as she's a late edition it didn't seem that out of place.I was amazed with the preemptive thought that went into this final edition. Every scene that passed, I had to take a breath, everything seemed to gel effortlessly, although at the same time seemed complicated.

"This movie was actually good and enjoyable, i could say this movie has plot holes as and the middle part of the movie was pretty boring, mostly because the middle part didn't feel like avengers, but i gotta say that the beginning and and the ending was the best parts, i could watch this movie as many times i want, but to compare this to infinity war, infinity war wins in my opinion, because this one starts slow, i do recommend this but it had some flaws",positive

"Tony said that he wanted to return to the family and accompany his family, but in the end he chose to come back, because of his responsibility and mission, because ""I am Iron Man."" The US team once missed the date with Carter, missed 70 years with Carter, and later attended Carter's funeral, personally sent his love to the road, thank the director for giving him a perfect ending. Black Widow is noble, heroic, heroic, fearless, and Iron Man are the greatest avengers. Thor and good mother say goodbye, Tony and father shake hands and make people cry. The American team made up for the biggest regrets in their lifetime; Banner and Hulk reconciled; Hawkeye reunited with his family; Black Widow has no family because the Avengers are her family ... The ending is too perfect and too tearful. The scene of the collective return of the ashes heroes of ""Reunification 3"" is magnificent and heartbreaking, and its scale has been increased by at least five times compared with ""Reunification 3"". In particular, the appearance of the ""Women's Federation"" is so amazing that it perfectly interprets the power of women.

"Endgame isn't just any regular super hero movie where ultimately the good guys defeat the bad guy. It's something entirely different. There's a Villain who's motive is really convincing andheroes who were defeated and are vulnerable. Ultimately it's not the triumph of good against the bad, it's the triumph of the greater good for all mankind. This is what that makes the movie unique.
Russo brother's has done an outstanding job in bringing such a movie which is in a class on its own. Every single actors were excellent, but ultimately Chris Evans and Robert Downey Junior outshone every single person. Forget the negative criticism from peoples. This movie is a once in a generation event and must be seen from the theatre. Definitely it'll give you goosebumps.",positive
"Avengers Endgame is simultaneously the final chapter and a new beginning for the MCU. It brings to a close many of the stories and character arcs that have been built-up since the beginning with Iron Man. As a grand ending, is the film worthy? Yes it is. It's a great closing chapter as well as the start of something new. As a whole the film is good, though not without problems. I think this film is inferior to Infinity War, as well as the other MCU films the Russo Brothers have directed.I thought the first forty minutes and the last hour of the film were fantastic. The acting is superb from everyone. The action scenes are great. The final fight of the film is the most phenomenal and rewarding action scene of the MCU or any superhero film. There's one scene involving Captain America that truly made me smile. With Cap being my favorite MCU character, this was my favorite scene of the film. The music is good. The effects are gorgeous. The epilogue is great. I loved what this film did for both Iron Man and Captain America. This was their film above all, and I was ultimately satisfied where their characters ended up at the end.However, the middle portion of the film is definitely the weakest link of the movie in my opinion. The film is long; the longest comic book movie ever maybe. The first and third acts felt very fast, but in the middle portion I started to feel the length. It does get a bit boring. That's not to say the second act doesn't have any exciting or touching moments. It does, but it fails to live up to the first and third acts.That's mostly due to my expectations and personal preferences. The film does go in a direction you would not have expected from the trailers in the second act. Honestly, this was the last place I would've wanted the movie to go. Not that the film does it badly, but this is a plot point that's been done so much to death in fiction, from movies, TV shows, cartoons, anime, manga, and especially comics. Most of the time it's used as crutch for writers to get themselves out of a corner they put themselves in, and I'm just sick of it. It's also something that's so easy to screw-up and makes your entire story convoluted. In this film they try so hard to make everything make sense, and it mostly does, but there are still a couple things that you call into question.I honestly think it would have been better if they just adapted the original Infinity Gauntlet comic more faithfully. They should've introduced Adam Warlock and the universal concepts. That would've been insane. They even teased Adam Warlock in one of the past MCU films. I guess they're saving them for future movies.There are also a few blatant logical issues. Infinity War had this too, mainly revolving around Thor, but this film even more so. One plot point near the end completely negates the importance of the Infinity Gauntlet itself from Infinity War. It does lead to arguably one of the best moments of the movie, but it's still a pretty big leap in logic.The last major issue I have is what the film does with two major characters; Thor and Hulk. These two characters go through dramatic changes in this film. Now, these changes do make sense from a story sense. It wouldn't bother me as much if they did more in the film. Thor doesn't do that much until the third act, which is disappointing given how awesome he was in Ragnarok and Infinity War. Hulk doesn't contribute anything fight wise, which is even more of a disappointment. Hulk was barely in Infinity War, so I was expecting a big comeback in this, but that's not what happened.Overall, Endgame is a good film, and a good ending/beginning chapter of the MCU as a whole. It's not my favorite MCU movie, or even in my top 5. It's definitely the weakest of the Russo Marvel films. The film is a bit long, and I would've gone a different direction with it. There's some questionable logic in the film, and I'm not a huge fan of where they took Thor and Hulk's characters. However, despite all that, I was mostly satisfied by the end. If you're a big fan of Cap and Iron Man like I am (especially Cap) their resolutions are emotionally satisfying. I almost don't want to see anymore MCU films after this because this wrapped everything up pretty well. Everything from the first Iron Man to now has felt like a giant continuous story arc, and now it has finally come to a close. It's the end of an era for sure.",positive
"Movie is full of action, but even for that I wait last 30 min when the movie Will be over, cause it didn't have hype to keep me exciting. Characters are great written. Some Characters as Thor and Hulk are much different that we been seen them before. Fight scenes and acting are better in Infinity war.For example:when Thor come in Wakanda in Infinity war. Story line is great, but have some gaps. In this movie Cap. American and Iron man are in front plan. In this movie Thor is so so different and almost act like a girl. This is to big turn over for such musculine and strongest character of all Avengers.on moment it looks like this is Cap America or Iron man movie.
I expect much more after media advertising.",positive
Loved this movie as I have loved all other Avengers movies...bar one..Captain Marvel. So glad she (Brie Larson) was only in it for a short time or I would have scored it less. Loved the humour and the old familiar Avenger Heroes. Chris Helmsworth was hilarious. Robert Downey Jnr was brilliant as were the others.,positive
"Has a mass-market blockbuster ever opened on such a downer as this one? Infinity War's ending made anything else impossible, of course, but what one expects from such a major movie is not an hour or so of a whole set of characters learning to live with loss and grief. It's to the movie's immense credit that this sustained so long, and so well handled, to the extent that the occasional flashes of Marvel humour in that segment of the film don't seem out of place. Occasionally we pan out to the big picture and global scale of the loss. One character saying ""I miss the Mets"" brings you up short; so many have died that, even 5 years later, professional sports can not function. Another powerful moment is a scene that takes in a monument bearing the names of some of The Vanished - the monument seems endless.As well as this is handled, this wasn't my major concern ahead of the film. That revolved around what Endgame was going to do about the overwhelming loss of Infinity War. Science-fiction/fantasy stories run in to trouble, stretching credibility even in terms of their own worlds (which is the only credibility that really matters), when they get out of a narrative tight spot or emotional downbeat by pressing some kind of metaphorical 'reset button'; what happened didn't really happen, or is just undone. I feared even further when the proposed solution in Endgame started to be unpacked. In a manner of speaking, I was right to worry about this. A metaphorical reset button is pressed, but it's done in a deft way; the journey to that point is fraught with real loss that can't be undone, not to mention a bravura trip back through various points in some of the movies that have bought to this point, with scenes replayed from new angles (to say much more would be to risk too much of a spoiler). Both of these choices are well handled; as ever, this series mostly manages the dance between humour and sadness with great dexterity.The major loss of the film was genuinely moving; other losses, less so. When you have a series of films that has (so far) lasted 11 years and 21 films, and introduced (according to Wikipedia) 226 characters, there's only so much attachment one can build up to many of them. Plus I'm old, and I forget things. This is especially so in one key plot strand that ends with 2 characters having to resolve which of them will sacrifice for the other. It's a powerful moment, but to be honest I just didn't care enough about them to really be moved by what could have been a landmark moment.Much has been made in the last year or so of Marvel introducing its first film led by a black character (the excellent Black Panther) and a woman (the good but not outstanding Captain Marvel); these were indeed significant cultural moments. Endgame undercuts them somewhat by disappointingly sidelining them both for most of the film; admittedly, in the case of Captain Marvel at least, this may be as much to do with working out a reason for her immense powers not to be the solution to every problem. Even so, it doesn't really work for me; in the movie's defence in this regard, however, my 10-year old, previously superhero averse, daughter sat through it all without a toilet break or complain not once, but twice, because ""The girls kick butt!""; which is certainly true of some less central female characters.Two performances stand out for me: Josh Brolin as Thanos is brilliant, managing to imbue such a cosmic villain with pathos. Paul Rudd (Ant Man) is, for me, one of the least appreciated parts of the MCU, and his performance is superb here; great comic moments, and an occasional cypher for the more casual viewer who needs to be caught up to events. In addition, any moment in which Taika Waititi gets to give voice to his flawless comic timing as the voice of Korg is a good one; more of that, please.It's striking how little action there is for such a film; to be honest, this strained the running time for me. I think the middle third could have been contracted a little; it lagged at times. But I seem to be in a minority on that, as my daughter testifies above. For me it also suffers a little from 'Return Of The King' syndrome; there were several occasions when I thought it had finished (and wanted it to end), but another coda came along. Yes, there are a lot of character arcs to tie up; but it this is a film where neither the big picture nor micro narrative arcs are entirely smooth or neat, and the last 30 minutes or so dragged. What should have been a touching final scene for one character (and indeed the film) felt like blessed relief; other narrative developments earlier in the film were all but accompanied with a knowing nod to camera. The latter would at least have felt more in tune with the series' tone. The climactic battle isn't handled brilliantly either; there's too much going on with too many for me to really keep track of what's happening; a common fault of superhero films (Black Panther being one of the notable exceptions). I'm thinking that in this regard the makers could have learned from the flawless execution of the massed battles in the Lord of The Rings films.These are small complaints in context. We do need to take a moment to acknowledge the Marvel achievement here; when the first Iron Man movie kicked this all off 11 years ago, none of us really knew what would happen. None of us expected what has transpired; a multi-stranded, complex, overlapping set of blockbusters that (largely) standalone for the causal viewer, bring in new fans with no loyalty to the comic books (like me) and serve the hardcore fans also. To reach this point of the project and to do so as one of the biggest films of all time, with the confidence to inflict real loss on its characters and audience, is a unique cinematic achievement which, for all the faults in this film or any others in the series, is something likely to never be equalled. If anyone ever says again that modern attention spans are too short and people don't really like complex stories any more, that conversation can be ended with the sample of the Marvel films (and Game of Thrones); all we need is characters we care about, and we remain capable of following even the most complex of plots. Remember these films are serious hits amongst people much younger than me, with a far greater grasp of the narrative complexities spread over all the films. In that respect little has changed since story-telling began.There are themes and ideas to mine from this movies, and all that's gone before. Some of them will sit long in the mind, some of them give merely a fleeting suggestion. In all honesty, to really mine and understand those I'll need to revisit them all over a more condensed period of time; Endgame is certainly a film that you enjoy with a relatively limited engagement of the preceding films, but the experience will be all the richer in relation to the viewer's familiarity with the breadth of the context. For now, we come to an end that is also a rest, and a pause. We all need to take a breath.",positive
"Expect everything from this movie, because that*s what it's trying to be. It wants to be fan service. It wants to be an epic finale. It wants to be a beginning and stepping stone for the remaining heroes.It ends up being a collection of references and borderline fan fiction with a short 15 minute break for the kind of movie that you should expect from this franchise.Unfortunately you will be just exausted at that point by what retroactively seems like a bunch of ""Last week on Avengers"" clips. It's not even terrible, even though it's obvious filler material, it's often funny or heartwarming, but you see the minutes and hours walk by and it just. doesn't. go. anywhere. Up until the aforementioned 15 minutes, and those are painful since they remind you of the movie that you could have and should have seen up until this point.Followed by yet another 30 minutes of an ongoing funeral where the brand is literally and figuratively burries itself.Avengers managed to overstay their welcome, but I will still remember them fondly. But I also won't really miss them after this.",negative
"I say the greatest achievement, not the greatest film. But it certainly is one of the best I've seen in many years. Downey Jr and Evans say goodbye to the franchise with MCU best performances in this ode to the MCU itself. The fact this many character fit in is insane, and the film actively rewards you for watching the god-knows-how-many other films. Wonderful, wonderful achievement.",positive

but Iron man died at the end of the movie by saving everybody and captain America got old cause he changed in past about his experiment no so these two things is for sad except that amazing movie as movie start it doesn't look like they are going to have a good fight like in Infinity war but at the end you see a better fight than that so really loved it there was moment when captain america hold the thor's hammer i was like what i even want a new film on captain america too but at the end i realize that ain't going happen and no more sequel of avenger i guess cause man hero Iron man died so whatever but that last piece was the missing piece of puzzle totally loved it worth to watch..",positive

Before the smartest guys in the milky way start talking about the loopholes in the time travel theory let me tell you that this is a comic book movie and not a time travel documentary so please take it with a pinch of salt.. Having said that, the movie gets a lot of science right and the best part is the storyline, related Easter eggs and references to the previous movies and the sheer comic book on a larger than life magnitude that makes this movie the best comic book movie ever made... This is pure gold...",positive

"After 'the vanishing' in Infinity War, there were still a handful of superheroes left knocking about to try and restore order to the universe, but in Endgame the real hero is a rat. A lowly rodent scampers across the controls of Hank Pym's quantum machine, activating a few switches with his little ratty feet, bringing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) back from his five-year stay in the quantum realm. And it is Lang's return that kick-starts a desperate attempt to reverse Thanos' nefarious handiwork.If you can swallow such lazy writing, then you'll no doubt have no problem with the rest of the film, which resorts to that old chestnut - time travel - with all the paradoxical problems that arise as a result. Unfortunately, I struggle to let such things slide, annoyed by rather casual approach taken by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, whose script scampers lightly over the temporal issues like a rat over a console (I'm sorry, I just can't let that go). While the film is undeniably enjoyable as a slam bang piece of mega-budget entertainment, it isn't as flawless or as clever a denouement that one might hope for.Visually, Endgame is hard to beat and it's great to see all of the A-list stars of the past MCU movies coming together for one last effects-filled battle (it's amazing what $400,000,000 can buy), but for the culmination of a twenty-two film series, I had dearly hoped for something a bit more considered and fulfilling than a great-looking movie that is ultimately dependent on the actions of a rat (yes, it irritated me THAT much...).",positive
"I read the user reviews before I saw this movie. I thought perhaps the negative reviews were a bit unfair. But no! The cinema was filled to the max- I have never seen this before! Today's paper reported it is the highest grossing movie in history! Why? The audience were enraptured, laughing at seemingly unfunny moments, and cheering when good guy characters emerged. I think everyone drank the kool aid!
Most of the movie is ordinary and just like other Avenger movies. Special effects were used to insert characters in cameo roles. Nothing new here folks!
I have tried to analyze its popularity and have concluded that it is really simple to please the masses. People dont want complex scifi, a simple good- bad guy formula with a touch of routine comedy, good looking actors made more attractive with special effects touch ups, and some character familiarity will do the trick. Throw in a lot of multicultural references and political correctness and voila! Big bucks.",negative
"This movie was amazing. I couldn't imagine a more perfect follow-up to Infinity War or a more perfect ending to this 11 year, 22 film story arc. This movie is dramatic, it's emotional, it's hilarious, it's fun, it has great action, it's pretty much everything that you'd want out of one of these movies. I think I like Infinity War a little more, but this movie is a close second! That's pretty much all I can say without spoiling anything. This movie has many surprises and I don't want to give any of them away, so just go see it if you are even a little bit of a Marvel fan. As I've stated before, I'm not a big Marvel fan but I really connected with this movie in a pretty meaningful way. This is the film event of this generation. Don't miss it!",positive
"It's an epic movie that ends up in both the best and the worst of ways that reminds us of Marvel's past. When the fanatics hear that Iron Man dies, they cry and it seems that Thanos has snapped his fingers in real life, but I have in mind that Iron Man will come back in two ways: Either he does not die and he comes back normally or else he comes back but not in physical form, but rather in hologram because let's think, Iron Man has always worked with holograms, as we see in several films of the same, so it is as if he were a brother genius of Tony Stark. Hence my idea. And I'm going to pick up another question that is Thor's getting fat. I think this is one of the best ideas the movie world has ever seen. But go see the movie, do not waste time and enjoy the moment! As for the future of Marvel, no comment.",positive
So sad about some character's passing but this was an amazing watch and a great end!,positive

"Let me start by saying that there are no spoilers in this review in spite of the fact that the movie AVENGERS: ENDGAME has been out for some time and many have leaked. As a matter of fact the description of the plot here will not take up a lot of time either. That's because this movie has done something amazing. If you haven't seen AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR though there are some things in that being revealed here. So go buy it, rent it or borrow it and watch it.Many people have given the super hero movies a bad time since they began coming out. What they fail to realize is that these movies are at their heart the same stories that have been told since the times of ancient Greece and earlier. They are stories of heroes, men and women who place themselves in harm's way for something greater than themselves. They are meant to inspire mere mortals to do better.Marvel Comics has taken their properties and done with them something no one has ever achieved before in movies. Forget sequels and franchises. They rarely make it past a few films with only a fleeting glimpse at continuity. Only the James Bond series might come close and even there we had several actors in the lead role. No, Marvel has done something beyond even that.Beginning in 2008 Marvel began telling a story. In the eleven years since they've released 21 films that have culminated in their final chapter with the 22nd film which is AVENGERS: ENDGAME. Each movie beginning with IRON MAN was a chapter in the book that was this wide ranging story that brought together characters from various comics and timelines, from Earth to outer space, from humans to aliens. At the end of each movie a hint of what was to come next began something no one had done before this effectively, a post credit scene that made people sit in the theater through all the credits to find out what was coming next. And each also paid tribute to the creator of most of these characters with a cameo by comic book legend Stan Lee.That's an amazing thing when you consider it. When you put these movies together and give them perhaps 2 hours each that's 44 hours of story, probably more since most were not that short. And each one was a stepping stone to this one, this last movie in the initial lineup of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It will go on but with different stories and perhaps even different players. We'll have to wait and see.So this movie. Time for spoilers somewhat. At the end of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR the evil Thanos had removed half of the population of not only Earth but the entire Universe. Many of the heroes we'd been watching just blew away into dust never to be seen again. ENDGAME picks up five years later with a world where people are still recovering from this shock. And the Avengers are still trying to find their place in this world. Then Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Ant-Man, suddenly pops up.Trapped in the quantum realm when everything took place he was unaffected by it all. And he has a theory that they can use the quantum jump machine he used to go back in time. At first Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) thinks this is impossible. But he figures out a way to make it work and the next thing you know the various members remaining are traveling in time to acquire the Infinity Stones and reverse all that Thanos has done. Of course something is bound to go wrong. It does and the result at the end of the film is an entirely new battle between Thanos and his forces and the entire Marvel heroes lineup.Like the classic movies that featured a star studded lineup of multiple actors this film does that in spades. If you were a player in any of the Marvel movies in the past, if you were a hero, you'll have screen time here. The main players more than others but everyone is represented.In addition to that like all good dramas there is tragedy on hand here as well. Not everyone will make it out of the last battle or even getting to it. This might leave an opening for new stories but at least for one it will be a fond farewell. I dare anyone to watch the entire film and finish without a lump in the throat or a tear fall.That's because the film is not about men in tights but about heroes. People who are willing to sacrifice for the big picture. People who are willing to lay down their lives for the greater good. These may be comic characters but it makes you think of those in real life who would do the same. These movies should inspire children to do their best, to realize that sometimes life is about more than just them. With 22 movies Marvel has done just that. It's an achievement that should be applauded. And this movie, even at 3 hours long, is well worth your investment of both time and money. It's one of the best pictures in some time.",positive
"I do not see why everyone was giving the plot of this movie a 1 or 2 star. I can say watching this movie for 3 hours, it tied up all the previous movies all in one bow and left no questions unanswered. I think some viewers wanted more death scenes but for me I was truly satisfied and entertained since watching all the marvel movies at the start of first Ironman. You will definitely try to hold back some tears which I was good at but this movie will try to make you cry. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did since this is the last avengers saga.",positive
So unfair to the Thor's character. I felt the character was totally treated bad. Even the Hulk's character was wasted.,positive
"I'm not going to complain about the time travel inconsistencies of a fictional movie - I actually enjoyed the film, but there are a few things about it that are just fundamentally poor taste.
Since few will read this entire review I'm going to start with the single reason why this movie is a five and not an eight:
If I were Chris Hemsworth I would hit one Russo brother with Mjolnir and the other brother with Stormbreaker. What a disservice to both Hemsworth and the incredible character he gave all of us. Ok, start him out fat, get some laughs, move on. If his lightning can braid his beard it can strip off a few pounds too. Now my last memory of Thor as an Avenger is the atrocity of Beachbum Avenger Thor. I will never understand how this was allowed to happen.
Give me one good reason, other than the obvious pandering, why CA gave his shield to Sam when Bucky, who is basically the same as CA, is standing right there. To top that, they've been lifelong friends and can't be bothered to say goodbye?
Same type of pandering and for the same type of obvious reason, the all female team assembled to protect CM - really? As if she needs anyone after destroying an entire ship by flying through it. This may not have irritated me so much if Brie Larson were a better CM AND if she hadn't said all of the ridiculous accusations she's been spouting lately. We didn't hear anything about a problem with white males when she was trying to become a star did we? I thought I might be being a little harsh until my wife brought up her annoyance about the same thing.
The show is worth seeing if you can handle the disappointment they delivered to us with some of their decisions. I always thought when it came to the movie side of Marvel that Stan Lee was just a front man. Now with the lack of quality present in both movies since his passing, I'm starting to wonder.",positive
"Almost but not quite Marvel. A good effort, but way too many issues.
1. Why would Hulk take the stairs??? Huh??
2. No Hulk / Thanos rematch???
3. Why didn't Captain America sacrifice himself for Iron Man??? After all, Stark had a family etc. Instead we are focused on arguably the dullest Avenger.
4. Thanos was way too weak! Why???I could go on.... but anyway, you get the picture. Overall, it fell somewhat flat. The first hour is a little boring and by the end it feels like you've watched some kind of American propaganda video.
Must try harder Marvel.",positive
"...only to - after almost 2.5 hours of boring preparation - end up in a happy ending and of course more CGI laden version of ""Avengers: Infinity war"" with all the protagonists ever to have been in Marvel movies appearing on screen in a CGI festival which shows the true dilemma of modern movie making and the the Marvel world in special. They wanna pack it all in and in the end they get nothing, mixing it all up in a terrible way. We suddenly have Captain America to hold Mjölnir, Pepper Potts got a suit and fights (aargh!),Scarlet Witch seems to be the most dangerous opponent to Thanos, Thanos being apparently stronger without the stones (so don't go for them, dumb ass!) and among that all we have valkyrie riding her winged horse, just to mention a few. The only good scenes are the ones with Thor, and they are also the only ones where the emotional side is delivered in a believable way. Which is also a hint where the true magic of such movies _could_ be: telling stories of myths and magic, and not CGI overkill movies. Sadly, that's what we got once more, and the typical US approach anyway. So, this movie is nothing but 2.5 hours of time waste to end up in roughly 20 minutes of senseless CGI pseudo battle. If you watch it to be able to judge for yourself and get another idea of contemporary movie making, you can do that while making the dishes or doing something else useful in parallel.",negative
"After eventually catching up to the MCU, I began this movie, and somehow avoided a lot of spoilers, and it was worth it. Although the movie began slow following the end of Avengers Infinity War, it did begin to drag, and I felt like when they were collecting the Infinity Stones, it was dragging, and did feel like a bore, but however when Thanos found out what they were doing, it did begin to get interesting. Losing Nat early was a shock, I was not expecting that. When Bruce finally received the Infinity Gauntlet, he finally clicked his fingers and everything went back to normal. However Thanos already found out what they were doing, and he and his army attacked, I really enjoyed the finally battle, it was a great climax to the Infinity saga. If I was to criticise it, it would be that we didn't see enough of the Hulk in the battle scenes, and it was mainly focused on the big 3. Nevertheless this was a great finale to the saga, and with the death of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers finally marrying Agent Carter, he lived his life and passed the mantle to Sam Wilson for Captain America, it was a great finale and would definitely recommend especially if you're watching the MCU movies as a whole.",positive
"For a series in the Marvel universe that started fairly bland, MCU's Avengers: Endgame brings out everything that makes it stand out.
Characters were solid, all respected their role in the plot and not one of the dialogues between them was redundant.
Plot kept its pacing, coherence and more importantly its continuation from Infinity War which is essentially Part 1 of this movie.
This is one the weird movies that doesnt soely rely on its own 1hr 30 mins narrative to drive a plot, but takes privileges from the movies that came before and neatly tie everything down, its clever and well executed, i honestly wish there were more moments like this in the MCU.
No spoilers so its short, this is a movie that deserve praise, 10/10 for perfect sequel.",positive
"Great movie and loved it. There was backstory why Barton turned all ""evil"" and kills bad guys like that Yakuza boss. Especially Thor's part when they attack Thanos after he had destroyed the Infinity Stones. Thor completely looses it and everyone looks bewildered and Thor just says ""I went for the head."" Nice callback to Infinity War but I can only imagine how he must feel. Having failed the universe. Then the scene with rock dude whose name I can't remember. Everyone laughed at the fat Thor. Not me. I know, cliché blah blah blah. Still not funny. More people need to know how it feels to hit rock bottom so this cliché can end.The main problem was basically undoing the plot of Thor: Ragnarök just because of a nod to Age of Ultron joke where Captain America also lifts the hammer. Thor: Ragnarök established that in the MCU canon the lightning comes from Thor himself, not Mjolnir. How to heckity does Cap cast lightning with Mjolnir. They should have made it only a powerful hammer. Leave the lightning out when Cap uses it. Continuity. This and the aforementioned joke 8/10. [Edit: Yes, apparently Mjolnir is a source of Thor's powers too but it isn't source of Thor's powers if Thor uses it. Wtf?]I liked the ending and I am waiting enthusiastically what the future of MCU brings us after Steve's ""death"" and Tony's actual death. Now I'm just repeating myself but I really liked Thor's ""journey"" in this movie. I think you might already have figured out why.",positive
"This movie is very emotional and funny at the same time. We can see how much the characters have developed from the start of the MCU. I'm little dissapointed with the lack of fighting scenes and with the ending. I can say what scenes will make great memes. Thank you Marvel for this great period in my life and for all the great movies u created. Keep going on.
P.s. Thanos in that garden reminded me of Shrek.",positive

"I really wanted to love this movie. In fact this movie was the reason I watched all the movies in 'Infinity Saga'. Well, all except 'Captain Marvel'. The visuals and special effects are awesome but I didn't like many other things in this movie. I wanted to hate Thanos but I kept liking him and feeling sad for him. This is not how I usually want to feel for a baddest villain. Christ Pratt was made a fool of just to please the leftists since they hate him so much. I hated Gamora in this movie. The only adult female characters I liked in this movie were Black Widow and the Scarlet Witch. Thankfully Captain Marvel wasn't THAT annoying. There were many illogical things here and there even for a sci-fi fantasy movie. I see where this is going. By removing the main characters of Avengers they are giving way to a woke avengers movie. Again, I really wanted to love this movie after the hype but it was really messy half of the time. It's no way near Titanic which was a standalone movie whereas this one was a built up of about twenty movies.",positive
"That movie was so emotional, yet full of action. Funny, yet deep with meaning. The plot line was so well thought out, that it gave you the impression it's impossible for a human brain to actually pull this off. Every little detail clicked, every scene had its meaning. I've never laughed and cried and were at the edge of my seat all at the same time, in a single movie. I thought it was gonna be just a re-do, a battle and then bye-bye Avengers era. But, no. It was so much more. It was an epic way to mark a 10 year old journey. Russo brothers, you blew me away. You better get an oscar for that screen writing. Oh, and RDJ you are a brilliant actor. You deserve all the millions they gave you. EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY.",positive
"I recently bought both this, and part one The Avengers: Infinity War, used on ebay (as I have boycotted Disney). I must say, I was disappointed (in both), although each has made billions. Most of the Avengers were whiny, pathetic renditions of their former selves. Ant Man was the exception. Regarding the Disney inserts of playful Marvel banter? Many felt VERY forced, to the point where it was borderline uncomfortable to watch. I needed to see it to finish out the MCU. I 'might' watch Guardians 3. Might. Used. I'm not interested in further feeding The Rat that IS modern Disney. So sad, as I grew up in the 60s/70s when Disney was great.",positive

In addition, they gave every character the perfect screen time !
I Must say that everyone should see this MASTERPIECE On IMAX to see the beauty of it.",positive
"Although the movie was 3 hours long, no one was willing to leave halfway through. In the early hours of the premiere, the cinema was still crowded, and everyone was waiting for the end. We know that the mission of heroes is to save the world, and even to give up their families, lovers, children, friends. Goodbye my Stark, goodbye my Natasha.",positive
"Let me get this straight, this movie is totally overhyped and I don't recommend wasting the 2 hours of your precious life just for an enjoyable last 40 minutes of the final battle. Even the final battle wasn't up to the mark, after an unimaginablely awesome portal scene we get 10 minutes of entire 10 years of MCU just punching, that's it which suddenly ends by sacrifice of iron man, and marvel even wasted a character like Spiderman. And did the death of black widow had any influence, I don't think so, an awesome character who ended up as a glamor in the movies.
Overall this movie is a no go, if you want to watch it, go for the last 40 minutes, the rest is crap.",positive
"And they made the one that really, really worked.
There were old people, 70+ years old, and young,6, 7, or 8 years old.
Total fans and people who had only seen a few of the preceding 22 movies
They all applauded.
There were times the theatre was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.
There were times when everyone held their breath.
There were times you could not be so stone coldhearted that you would not tear up.
There were times when you could not help but smile.
There were times when you had to laugh.
There were times when you recalled a special moment from an earlier movie in a brand new way.
There were things that are brand-new
By the end of the movie you saw the whole series in a different light.
I wish I could see it again without ever having seen it beforehand.
There were so many small touches that made the movie special and capped the series perfectly. And yet, the movie worked for people who had never read the comics or seen most of the movies.
Like I said, they made the one that really, really worked.
Thank you, Avengers!

"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of the MCU and this film absolutely delivered with emotion, visuals, action and comedy. The film may be long but it's certainly never boring. Check out this film because it is great!",positive
"""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and many, many more. Oh man, what a cast! Just like ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), I was blown away by this film. The Russo brothers have done it again! Great story, great acting, great special effects, great sets/locations, and great soundtrack. Every factor is top-notch in this movie! I am not going to spoil this movie. This is all I'm going to say about it. Is this the best superhero movie? No, there are some I personally like better. But, it's in my top 10 best Marvel movies for sure, if not top 5! Overall, the cast is extraordinary, and every character had their own shining moment. I was kind of skeptical about Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Most of you know that I absolutely hate the Ant-Man comic book character. Nothing against Paul Rudd, but the movie version of Ant-Man is very obnoxious. I was worried he was going to ruin it with one-liners and jokes. But, to my surprise, he was not that bad. He played a critical factor in this movie, and his jokes were few and far between, and actually funny! The other characters are stellar as usual. Under the direction of the Russo Brothers, that's not surprising! That's all I'm going to say, I will not spoil the Endgame. You'll have to go see the movie to find out how good it is for yourself! Believe me, you won't be the same. If you think you know what this movie will be like from watching the trailers, you have no idea what you're in for! Props to you, Anthony and Joe Russo. You guys did a Marvel-ous job again! I look forward to other future movies with your involvement, and I hope you continue to direct other superhero movies in the future! This movie is absolutely worth the money to see it in the theater and also to buy on DVD. Obviously, I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Avengers: Endgame"" yet, what are you waiting for? Go check it out if you haven't already! Remember, once you guys see it, DON'T SPOIL THE ENDGAME!""We're in the Endgame now.....""",positive
"Maybe it's better to see Infinity War (2018) because it do picks up what is left of that particular flick. Clocking in over 3 hours it was for me way too long to watch.Maybe no-one will understand me but 3 hours it has to be good. And it do has it moments building up to the fight towards the last part of this flick but it also has a lot of boring moments and moments were they are talking too much.I's towards the last half hour that it really becomes what you're waiting for, the endgame. As said, it's not all that bad but the irritating conversations of Tony Stark made me yawn a lot and even reach for the remote control.Nice to see that Spiderman is involved sadly we do know by now that it could be a once in your lifetime experience. DC and Marvel coming together, not for Disney anymore. Money makes the world goes around.

"I will write this without giving a single spoiler.
As many of us Marvel fans have started this journey over 10 years ago, I can confidently say that we have grown up and grown so very attached to each character. We've connected with these Superheroes on so many levels, love, joy, happiness, and so many laughs.
I'm usually a tough critic with movies, but I cannot say any other than this wasn't just an amazing Marvel movie; But an amazing movie in general. Every aspect of this movie brings you so much closer to the Hero's we fell in love with as children and showed us why they are hero's. This is a must watch Movie. And as funny as this sounds, this Superhero movie was Beautiful, thought invoking, motivational and so very loving. We could not have asked for anything better. Lastly I will say is, Marvel gave us a perfect start to the world of Marvel and most importantly a complete and perfect start.
I honestly want to thank every single person involved with this masterpiece and say how much I appreciate what we e been given.",positive
"An honest review not like the clear fanboys. It is better than Age of Ultron but below Avengers Assemble. Lots of plot holes and some of our favourite characters ruined. Too much humour after the disasterous ending of Infinity War. All that being said it is still a must watch and it will be nice to see the next phase now. I did feel there were too many characters involved and some of our favourite not getting enough screen time. The last 45 minutes is where it is at but i would struggle to watch the movie again, unlike Infinity War which i saw 3 times.",positive
"Disappointing, Emotional BS, Family BS, Random Moments that try to be funny, Overpowered Women, Underpowered Thor, Boring 1st Hour & many more....This movie was a disgrace to the entire franchise. Watching the avengers & other marvel movies that all lead up to this.... Hell No!To all reading this review Do Not watch Marvel movies like I did; all those expectations lead to this... :-{
Investing all those hours & emotional energy & it all went down the drain.I give the movie a 4 for the action scenes & the VFX, the rest was just Underwhelming.",negative
"A great end of an era. That's all I need to say. Not a crazy Marvel fan, but this one just got me right away.",positive
"In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.",positive
"All of these 1 and 2 star reviews, WHAT movie did these people watch?",positive
"I appreciate many desperate people want to seem ""edgy"" or ""alternative"" by defining themselves as ""different"" but really, you come off as nothing more than the representation of inadequacy. I'm not suggesting you need to love this movie or that you can't find fault, but what this and it's predecessor, Infinity War, achieved; not only in cinema, but storytelling as a whole, is laudable. This is not a stand-alone movie and requires some foreknowledge, but it's an accomplished endgame of a movie arc of over 10 years unlike any other in movie history",positive
"This movie was the ultimate experience of mcu movies, it had the tears, it had the jokes, it had the satisfaction but most importantly for me, it had the heart. This rarely felt like (just a superhero movie) this felt more like a pay off to all of the characters that the mcu made us love from the beginning...(( S P O I L E R R E V I E W ))
The best pay off for me was the Iron man one... i've been a hardcore fan of Iron man since the movie came out and cried so hard and loudly when he died and so that's probably the best pay off for me but there are some great references and call backs to other movies in this movie like the elevator scene from the time travel stuff (call back from winter soldier) and that ""on your left"" scene at the end when everyone came back"" and my favourite moment from this movie was when captain took mjölnir and went ""Avengers.... Assemble!""That's when i really started crying and got chills and there are so many other great moments in this movie that makes hard to write about all of 'em so my tip is go watch the movie for your self if u haven't already.... strong 9,7/10 from me so it gets a 10/10....",positive
"F..., i was just like a child again. Crying like a baby.
This movie derserves the title Endgame!!!
Simply outstanding! Overwhelming!",positive
"I'll start out by saying that overall the film was enjoyable and I did leave the theater with a certain sense of satisfaction. However, when you recap films in your head afterward and reminisce in your favorite moments I found myself going, wait....that doesn't make any sense...why did they do that????They completely trashed Thor and Hulk. They turned the Hulk into a geeky professor that could barely smash anything anymore They turned Thor into a self pitying drunk. Why? Thor has been through worse than this and yet now he's all of the sudden feeling so down on luck and depressed with life? This makes no sense. He's lost his mother, father, brother, home planet for pete's sake...he's been through worse! Why did they need to destroy Thor's character? And Hulk. I really enjoying seeing Hulk smash things. They turned him into more of a geeky old man than a brute.What the heck was the point of Captain Marvel in this movie? She had what....10 minutes screen time in the entire movie? It felt like the Captain Marvel movie was a 1 billion dollar GOTCHA from Marvel after watching this film. I was thoroughly dissapointed that we didn't get to see some sort of blockbuster fight scene between Captain Marvel and Thanos. At first she completely slaughters the mother ship in two quick flights. Then all the sudden she gets slapped across the screen like a tiny child? Seriously? She's more powerful than that! You gave yourself a powerful character with the Captain Marvel movie...do something with it!I am dissapointed that I won't get to replay happy film memories in the coming years. Overall, I think I got my money's worth with the film but I do feel like the directors royally dropped the ball. It felt like they did a really good job with Infinity War and then they realized that they dug themselves into a really deep hole that they couldn't direct themselves out of so they pieced this film together at the last second....",positive
"This film has been the build up of 11 years of which 21 movies have structured a saga of enthralling movies to pay off for this one film. And I have to say this movie was amazing. The way the movie starts off shows that this is going to be a wild ride from beginning to end. This film starts off with a reflection of the events of infinity war as we see a take of death like few other superhero movies like no other. The avengers are seen as hopeless as we see the impact of the snap on everyone's lives. When ant man comes in he is clueless of what's going on so he finds the avengers as they start the search for a plan to bring everyone back. The avengers reassemble which is akin to when they assemble the avengers in the 2012 original. It is perfect and reflects the movie as it tends to tribute famous scenes in the mcu there is a clear difference as now they are depressed as a lot of the film shows the characters in peril.
They then go to restore the infinity stones and go back in time to get the stones to bring everyone back. And the adventure there is great, most of the films comedy comes from here which is a good way for a break to tension and revisiting these scenes are amazingly nostalgic and easily will bring a smile to the face of anyone who has seen the other films. The 3rd act includes in my opinion the best final battle of any film as the build up to it in this movie let alone is great. Seeing the before fat and drunk Thor revisiting Asgard, captain America vs captain America, tony stark visiting his father and the return to the battle of New York and the start if guardians of the galaxy are amazing scenes with Thor in this movie getting some great scenes as well as nostalgic scenes in tribute to the other films and how they linked them together.The conclusion holds in my opinion the best final battle scene ever in a movie. After hulk snapping his fingers he brings back all the deceased avengers bit not before thanos arrives as he was now here for revenge to get the stones back. A fight ensues as the avengers fight the black order and thanos' army. Thor ,iron man and captain America take on thanos as they again begin to lose but soon as another fan moment captain America picks up thors hammer as hinted at in age of ultron as the audience me included erupted in an applause. I should mention that the action in the film is amazing as people say that there is not to much action and is a bit prolonged with dialogue but the dialogue is essential to the plot as well as dramatic tension. The dialogue is easy to pay attention to and well executed. The action that comes is in long scenes but is done amazingly with fast paced well filmed beautiful cgi. Then after the captain America hammer scene ensues great action but cap and the avengers in peril the words "" on your left cap"" will stay in my head forever as portals opened with all of the heroes coming out Spider-Man black panther scarlet witch doctor strange peter quill and more as they returned in numbers with other armies from there respective films with a army akin to thanos . They stood there in numbers ready for captain America to say the words "" avengers... assemble "" followed by a massive charge with reunions fights and peril with all avengers teaming up in different ways in a scene that still gives me goosebumps today. Finally the ultimate sacrifice from the avengers greatest hero iron man in getting the infinity stones he watches thanos' fear as a response to his line "" I am inevitable "" iron man said ""I am iron man "" the line that capped off the first mcu film iron man as iron man dies with his last words engraved in the audiences minds thanos and his army turn to dust as the avengers mourn the death of the greatest avenger. This is the biggest fan tribute i have ever seen as the movie is on that marvel fans will love 3000 ( sorry for the corny message) but this is one of the greatest blockbusters ever which warrants being the biggest movie of all time. The directors clearly put in years of work for this movie and the movie will leave a legacy on film forever with the clever and well played out deaths of iron man and black widow. This is a must see blockbuster film which warrants all positivity it gets",positive
"Infinity wars was just epic. The build up from that film is what created so much hype towards endgame. However did endgame really deliver? I dint feel so.Gimmicky Time travel was also messed up, they tried so hard to make the audience buy it, when antman cracked a joke about it not being time travel. when tony stark said he wouldn't do it the first time. this to make the audience root for the plot. The time stone was gone when Thanos destroyed it, even borrowing stones from an alternate dimension would have been a great plot. And with all the intelligence in the marvel universe, humans crack time travel.. really..It was also like the guys were forced into being depressed. We had the heroes of the known universe until that point reporting to black widow? for what joy? and hawkeye, his only action sequences was running, and more running almost every time, but he has to run, your dealing with superheroes and super villains. the point I'm making here is that apart from not so great casting of certain characters, interaction and measurement of power has to be well translated. Anther example is Captain marvel making a guest appearance at the end, being able to over power Thanos while he wields the gauntlet.. Or tony stark taking a punch from Thanos without his headgear. His brains should have splattered. RDJ has a great personality, but the whole saga doesn't have to be about him, your dealing with the Marvel universe.Then you had them going back into separate timelines cooking up their own mini story sequences there, setting the energy of the movie offtrack.I dont know if I am watching the same movie as these guys with 10 stars, or is it just blind loyalty.For me avengers ended with infinity wars, so well done, character build up of Thanos was magnificent, to see him then reduced to a puppet with only sweet philosophy but not such a great death. Would be interested to hear about alternate plots and endings for endgame.",positive
"What a boring, predictable excuse for a movie. I'm so glad I resisted the hype and didn't suffer through this in the theaters. It's obvious this movies reviews are artificially inflated on this site, just look at all the other negative reviews.",negative
"The rumors are true: you'll laugh, cheer, and will probably cry several times because I did. A middling first 2 hours that's equal parts cool moments and problematic ones that ends with a final hour that's a downright divine geek wet dream. More character-based than action-based (Infinity War). It is a satisfying send-off and a beautiful love letter for the fans. Salute to the founding members- the OG 6. I love you 3000, Avengers. Thank you, Marvel and Russo Brothers!",positive
"I saw ""Avengers: Endgame"", starring Robert Downey Jr.-the Sherlock Holmes movies, The Shaggy Dog_2006; Chris Evans-Gifted, The Losers; Scarlett Johansson-Rough Night, We Bought a Zoo and Josh Brolin-Dead Pool 2, Men in Black 3.
This is the conclusion of last years' Infinity War-2018-and it is a nice trip down memory lane. The story line involves time travel, so past scenes from previous movies are seen-hence the trip down memory lane. Stan Lee has his last cameo in one of those time travel scenes and he is digitally de_aged to look younger. Robert, Chris, Scarlett and the rest of the surviving Avengers are left to deal with the aftermath of Josh's finger snap-remember, it wiped out half of the population in a blink of an eye-as they try to some how restore order to the universe. It's been 5 years and nobody has come up with a plan. Things are looking bleak. If you have ever read any comic books, you know things have a way of working out but there are consequences. That's what makes a good story. It's best if you don't know too much before seeing the movie, but I can tell you that there are some fantastic fight scenes, lots of humor and you get to see people like you've never seen them before-at least not in the MCU movies. And, there are casualties. There is not any surprise scenes during or after the end credits, however, the original 6 Avenger actors' autographs are shown when their names appear on screen.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi violence and action and language and has a running time of 3 hours & 1 minute-so make sure you hit the restrooms before the movie.
I really enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",positive
"What a masterpiece. I'm still in tears, even after 7 hours.. It was better than anything I've imagined.",positive
"Endgame really makes you look at all the movies as a whole series of events with an outcome. It makes all the movies come together in a way that makes everything better. They really did something special with Endgame, especially with the challenges they had going into it.",positive
"When Brie Larson arrived on Earth at the end of Captain Marvel she found the remains of Nick Fury's Avengers, the survivors of Josh Brolin's Thanos and his Infinity Stones grab. In Marvel Avengers: Endgame the Russo Brothers must band together this smaller group of superheroes to find Thanos, retrieve the Infinity Stones, and bring back their fallen comrades. The stones must then be returned to their original time in the past. Easy we might imagine in a film with a 181 minutes running time. I saw it opening day but you won't notice the length as it moves at warp speed.We can see who survived Infinity War from the poster, and thanks to Captain Marvel she brings Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark back to Earth after his fight with Thanos, with Karen Gillan's Nebula and Bradley Cooper's Rocket, into Gwyneth Paltrow's waiting arms. But there's no time to reminisce as Nebula knows where her father was going after Infinity War. But having achieved his aim Thanos destroyed all the stones.And with no way to bring back the 50% of the population destroyed, five years later our superheroes have found either domestic bliss, as in Pepper and Tony, Chris Evans's Steve Rogers is running grief counselling sessions, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow and Don Cheadle's War Machine are running the depleted office and well Hawkeye is really really angry about losing all his family and in Japan taking out gangsters. Jeremy Renner never got an answer to his mustard or mayonnaise question.Then one day an inquisitive rat presses a button in an old van and we get Paul Rudd's Ant-Man back. And he's a little surprised as to what the hell happened in the last 5 hours he spent inside the quantum realm. And given that time is altered in the quantum realm, maybe our superheroes could travel back to collect all the stones and click their own fingers to bring everyone back.
But Tony Stark isn't interested, he has his own family and doesn't want to change time. So maybe another brain might be able to create the quantum tunnel. A really big brain. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk has embraced his green side and is happy to take selfies with kids. And while I read of the year long training and diet that Scarlett Johansson followed for the back-to-back filming of both Infinity War and Endgame, well Chris Hemsworth's Thor has really let it all hang out. He got it easy this year. Nice to see Taika Waititi back as Korg. But having already done his bit with Thanos, Thor is quite happy drinking in the Asgardians' new homeland.And yet Tony Stark cannot quite stop thinking about a trip Back to the Future. And is even more amazed when his testing actually proves it is possible.So that's six stones to find; Time, Mind, Space, Reality, Power and Soul, and only one chance for each of the remaining Avengers to find them, and return, with their limited vials of Hank Pym's serum. Not everyone will survive as they split up to find the stones. But what great stories they'll have to tell about their adventures in the past. Although someone has discovered what our superheroes are up to. And he's coming.I've been following the Marvel Avengers films, and the Marvel Agents of Shield tv series for a long time now, and Endgame is a fitting climax. Cramming everyone from Marvel into the story line was no mean feat for the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, but I think everyone made it, even with the blink and you maybe miss them scenes. But the You and Whose Army was mind blowing. Could Captain Marvel have done it all herself I wondered, maybe, but where's the fun in that, anyway she cannot turn back time, and the Avengers have always been a team. Even when they fell out and had civil wars.With a rumoured budget of $400million the film was a hit the first weekend. Great fun and if you didn't enjoy it you don't have a pulse. Was it the final scene for Stan Lee though?",positive
Film which triggered a lot of emotion. Fantastic end to the franchise.,positive
"That part with all the women was so laughably bad. It was like all the girls against all the boys on the playground. I think that it's cool that they tried to make a feminist part, but the Russo brothers haven't talked to girls since 1st grade.",positive
"Violence is main means of conflict resolution, but story is primarily about courage, selfsacrifice, heroism, collective good. Themes include teamwork, perseverance, courage.Central characters are willing to die (and kill) to save universe and rescue Earth from grief/trauma they've experienced. Also shows how important family and friendship are, how concept of family is more than pure biology: People can have incredibly strong chosen families, with friends who love you unconditionally. Emphasizes idea of being who you are, not who you think you're ""supposed"" to be.",positive
"It is awesome, fantastic, but it was not as great as infinity war",positive

"Avengers Endgame is a terrific end to this decade long story. It's slower passed then Infinity War but I think it works. It takes its time to explore what has happened to the characters and what they do in this situation. The Professor Hulk at first throw me off at first but by the end of his first seen I liked it. I was good with the time travel but the way it was created was too easy. I didn't mind the fat though and by the end of the movie he was still fighting strong. I do see why people have a problem with him being the joke in this. I really did enjoy all the time travel, the were some fun and heartfelt moments. The final act was one of the best final acts I have ever seen. The portals scene was great and we finally got to hear the line ""Avengers Assemble"". The action was intense and fun and Iron man's death was handled very well. For me Infinity War was faster passed and more exciting and Endgame was more satisfying and I appreciate the slower pass. To me they are both of same quality and are my two favourites in the MCU.9.4/10",positive
This was the best marvel film I have ever seen and the action was off the charts I just don't like what they did to carol's hair at all.,positive
"I'm writing this month's after it was released, months after I saw it in the theaters. I saw it opening weekend. And honestly I've never felt that way coming out of a movie before. So many emotions, all swirling in my heart and head at once. It was utterly overwhelming. My personal experience was intense but based off the reactions of the rest of that theater crowd, so was everyone else's.
I like to watch a movie multiple times to see how it stands up. Watch for plot holes, inconsistencies, watch the acting again. See if things seemed forced or ingenuine. See if it brings up emotions again and again.
Today I'm watching it again. Still I feel the anger, sadness, grief, excitement, and thrill! The performances are amazing (although I'm not a fan of a blended Bruce Hulk being) and the pain they go through is gut wrenching.
No it's not perfect. Yes it's heavy, and the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the movie doesn't really have ""superheroes"". But that's why it's so powerful. They are broken, just like all of the universe is. They are human, struggling in an existence that doesn't make sense and they couldn't stop from happening. They miss their family and friends.
The last 1/3 of the movie is the perfect way to end this story.
Very well done. Compared to so many others out there lately, this one got it right.",positive
"After all this time, after all the movies, after all the laughs and battles we finally get to witness the end to the biggest movie saga of our lifetime. Never before has an endeavor so grand been accomplished and achieved.
Avengers Endgame lived up to the expectations and all hype. Per usual Marvel form Wndgame provided a wonderful story filled with action, plenty of laughs and more stars than we could keep track of.
This movie gave me chills and had me wondering what would happen next. I know phase four of the MCU is in our future but this culmination of over 10 years of movies was the pinnacle for me. I doubt Marvel will be able to top this story.
I won't be spoiling anything here but just know there will be plenty of laughs, tears and tense moments. It's a fantastic ending to the Avengers story. Or is it?? Can't wait to see what comes next.",positive

"Avengers: Endgame is an action, Sci-fi, superhero movie directed by Anthony Russo and Jeo Russo with screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and stars an ensemble cast from almost all the previous MCU movies.This is the 22nd MCU movie.In my opinion this could be called as the perfect ending of Avengers series and we might not see some characters in the future MCU movies which also includes one of my Favorite character Robert 'Iron-man' Downey Jr.The movie stars from where the Infinity war has ended and gives a perfect closure. The screenplay of the movie is written and executed beautifully and despite of the length of the movie, the movie will keep you engaged, the best part of the movie is that the movie will not make you feel about the length.Acting is great and all the characters were best in their respective roles. The movie had provided enough opportunity to everyone to showcase their talent despite of such a huge Star cast. The climax of the movie gives a perfect closure.Overall a great movie to watch and gives a perfect ending to the avengers series. A must watch for every avenger fan.",positive
"Infinity War is my favorite Marvel film by far. This chapter or finale felt a little flat for me. I understand it's hard to compress everything this large into a 3 hour film, I truly do. But, I felt some things were dwelled on for too long while some things were not explained well or at all. One scene was emotional for sure while others did not hit home for me. I truly feel in my heart of hearts that the plot should have gone in another direction with the ending, but I do get why it did what it did. Overall it was a decent movie that in the sense of all things completed has done that for this arch.",positive
"What's this dribble, there's about 30 minutes of action and it's a predictable boring at that and overall mind numbing silly movie , all but this one are okay , what agenda are the feminists pushing as they try going woke and ending up broke. Shame ,hope you downloaded it and were not shammed out of any money to watch...",negative

"There's only one word to describe Avengers endgame and it's EPIC. The scale of this movie is incredible. Well deserved to be the highest grossing film of all time.

If you aren't a marvel fan or haven't seen the other movies I'm sure you will enjoy it

"Avengers: Endgame changed the film industry as we know it, becoming not only one of the greatest superhero films of all time like Avengers: Infinity War did, but one of the most successful films in cinematic history with all twenty two MCU films, leading to this. After suffering unimaginable losses at the hands of Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, Tony Stark is lost in space with Nebula with only short time left to live. When they are rescued and brought back to earth by Captain Marvel, the remaining Avengers decide to hunt Thanos to try to undo what's been done. When they find Thanos and discover the infinity stones are destroyed, the Avengers have no choice, but to accept their losses and move on. After some time has passed and a quantum trapped Ant-Man emerges to offer the Avengers a chance to undo what's been done, the Avengers assemble for what could be the final time if not successful to undo Thanos's reign of terror on the universe no matter what it takes. So first off, this film absolutely lived up to the hype and expectations fans were expecting, giving us a superhero film unlike no other. Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man gives probably my favorite performance ever as the character in this film that shows what it truly means to be Iron Man. Also, Chris Evan's Captain America in this movie I felt was also the best version we have seen of the character. Chris Hemsworth's Thor was great, although I felt some of the writing choices for his character wasn't as great as Infinity War, but overall he was good. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner/Hulk brings us a new side of the character we haven't seen until now. Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow is stunning as always. Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton/Hawkeye/Ronin is great as well and is one of the standout characters of the entire film. Lastly Josh Brolin's Thanos was terrific as well, although he wasn't in it nearly as much as Infinity War, they still did a great job with his character. The visual effects, to the stunt choreography, and the set pieces for this film were unlike anything that's been done in films before and was pulled off masterfully. Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great conclusion to the infinity saga that brings us great character arcs, amazing action sequences, dazzling visual effects, a magnificent story, and also looks forward to what lies ahead for the future of the MCU. Rating 10/10.",positive
"Guess what Avengers Movie I saw MCU fans? You know? AVENGERS ENDGAME!!!!!! It is really really really really really awesome!!!! And it's one of my favorite films i've ever saw with my dad!!! This was way way way way better than Black Panther, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Venom, Captain Marvel and Avengers Infinity War! (which is also my favorite movie) The characters are all good. The CGI is all great. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) came back after being dusted by Thanos. The funny part of the movie is when Scott Lang (Ant-Man) turns into a Kid, an old man and a baby. I laughed at that part a little. And my favorite part is when the Avengers assembled all of the Avengers from different worlds to defeat Thanos. Thanos finally got defeated and dusted! And the ending was so emotional. I didn't cry during this scene, Just like when I saw the emotional ending scene from How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, I saw it 2 months ago, It was good too and I also didn't cry during that movie! And when I walked out of the theater when the credits ended, I felt very very very happy about that movie!!! I hope it will be on Disney's newest streaming service, Disney+. Which is coming on Monday, November 12, 2019. PLEASE GO WATCH THIS MOVIE IN DOLBY CINEMA OR IMAX!!!!! DON'T SLEEP OR DON'T WALK OUT DURING THE 3-HOUR MOVIE!!!!NOTE: I hope this movie will win an Oscar for Best Picture.NOTE 2: I didn't sleep or walked out during the movie. It was 3 hours & 1 minute long.I give this movie 10.9/10.9",positive
"I saw a many houndred of movies in my life. And there are a lot of them, they were really brilliant. But this year, Avengers Endgame filled up the whole year at the beginning.Great, Fantastic, Actors, Directors, Camera, Sound, SFX, Music. Alan Silvestri. One of the best scores since Forrest Gump.The Ending Scene is so full of love. I am really impressed. I was laughing, crying. So much of it. Thank you Marvel Studis, Thx Disney to feature this finale.People, I love you 3000",positive
"The movie is entertaining and time will fly faster than expected as you're in it. On any standard I do recommend the movie if not for anything else, but for it's entertainment value. I do believe the hype that is going on around the movie will be letting some people down.I'm in between giving it a 6 or 7 because of the well executed entertainment value it provides. I will have to round it down to 6 because of the amount of 10's this movie is getting at the moment. The movie neither blows your brains with plot twists or anything like that.Comparing this purely to other superhero movies I'd give this one a 9-. I think Infinity Wars was better, but this concludes the Avenger series perfectly.",positive
"This film is one of the best movies that Marvel Studios have made..It perform a vital role in the continuity of the story .When iron man says ""I am Iron man "" i had goosebumps at that time . When hulk snaps then the half disappeared population comes back but at last when they hap all the infinity stones they can bring Tony and Natasha back , why they didn't do that? Hulk can snap it again to bring them back.",positive
"This movies wasn't as good as I thought it would be. First of the ending was predictable and the deaths were just of the lesser characters or major characters you expected to die. It was just al so predictable and what they did to thor was a crime. They made him from an awesome god to a fat drunk just for the sake of comedy? Further I don't read that much of the marvel comics, but I'm quite sure they were really inconsistent with the comics. Such as Sam as the new captain? In the comics that's Bucky. And Valkyrie as the Queen is also something they just added for a cliché happy ending. My conclusion is that this just wasn't as good as infinity war.",positive
Not one time did the scene after a scene make sense or have anything to do with the previous scene. I know this was a kids movie really but wow. I wish luck to all that come after me. The future is not bright. Maybe one of you can stop this. I feel like I watched 4 different movies all just settiny up movies to suck more moneu from my wallet but im done. Chris Pratts likeability will no longer fool me into beliveing this film series has a heart. It does not. It is evil personified. Hollywoods sins on a silver platter. Hope you have hot sauce to choke down this garbage.,negative

An emotional roller coaster from start to finish. You can't find a better ending to the Avengers saga.DON'T MISS IT,positive
"This is best superhero movie that I ever watch. The storyline was great and powerful with its emotion weight and great treatment to all the characters. If you think Infinity War is more to Thanos storyline,then don't be disappointed because this is the Avengers movie. The movie also bring us to the journey where you can remember the movie what it's supposed to be. 30 years from now, I guarantee that you will introduce and share the love of this movie to your child or grandchild.",positive
"It really what we can call, the best end to the avengers.
The visual effects are wonderful with lots of laughter and emotional scenes.
The 3d 4dx worth it.",positive
Just how much time we need to see a movie like this again,positive
"The premise is good, the idea and concept are great, all the materials are historically foretold, but they put too many side stories on screen and making the movie too much about nothing important. This movie started to become alive again once the battle started.I would suggest a 30-to-40-minute cut would be great and release this theatrical version as extended version on BluRay would be better. If DCs BvS and Justice League required extended story scenes, this has way too many unnecessary scenes.However, I'm glad they ended it, however they don't have the ""WOW"" (shocking/surprising/exciting climatic) moments that usually ended a long sagas. Instead, they have a throwdown battle. At least the dramatic ending was 'proper' for retiring old celebrated heroes of the series.",positive
Fitting end to such a legendary saga. Dont see how this can ever be topped.,positive
"Consider two couples who have lost their life partners due to Thanos action(at the end of Infinity War). Now assume that within the next five years, to get on with the life, they have found solace in each other and got married (with the additional possibility of having kids). This is at this juncture that the Avengers are bringing back their old partners. You can imagine the havoc it brings into their personal lives. And that makes the Avengers villains. Had they been heroes, then they should have brought back the people, right after Thanos destroyed the infinity stones in the original timeline.Now, consider the case of Thanos. We believe that he is a lunatic and maniac. But from the movie Eternals, we can understand that he did disintegrate half of the population of the universe in order to stop the birth of celestial and thereby the destructions of entire planets.Now tell me, who is the villain and who is the hero?",positive
"After all these years THAT is what we get? A movie that makes no sense whatsoever, Because every time i try to figure something out about the movie another plothole appears.. X-Men3 The Last Stand is a masterpiece compared to Endgame and thats saying something!
3 stars only for Tom Holland, love him as Spiderman",negative
"I have seen this movie about 6 times (including opening night) and I love it as much as the first time! I have just been scrolling through reviews and could not believe some of the negative reviews on here! It has been called boring and some posters here have said the positive reviews have come from ""sponsors"". No, the positive reviews here came from a devoted fan base that have watched 22 movies for over a decade and are emotionally connected to the characters and the storyline! This movie IS the best ""fan service"" to ever be created!
I really do suggest you do watch this movie if you are a fan of the MCU and not listen to these pretentious ""critics"" who only like art house indie films and hate on everything made by a studio! If you are a fan of the MCU and have followed along the span of 22 movies and love the characters then this movie will run you through the gamut of emotions! I have never seen a more interactive audience in my life. Laughs and cheers at all the right moments and dead silence in the emotional ones. Not a dry eye in the crowd when the lights came on and no one was embarrased because everyone was on the same journey whether you were 7 or 57. My opinion may be biased because I LOVE these movies but most posters on here are down right cynical and will try to find something wrong with anything! I only post positive reviews because even if I don't like something it doesn't mean that someone can't like it and I don't want my opinion to sway their curiosity. Life is subjective in general but I try and only focus on the positive!",positive
"Thank you for 10 years of great entertainment! Loved all the 22 movies and can't wait to see the next 22.
A great ending to a 2 part movie. All was 5 stars, ALL! Masterpieces! Will rewatch all, forever... AVENGERS!",positive
"Felt like an hour and a half instead of 3, lots of character arcs and blends, Easter eggs for days, I have but one question, when Cap took the soul stone back to Vormir, what happened between him and Red Skull?, hmmm, great movie!!",positive
"Avengers Endgame is the culmination of 21 Marvel movies over 11 years and there can not be a better ending than this. What a befitting end to an incredible journey. The Dark Knight was the best comic movie ever made but now Endgame shares the top spot with it and it definitely deserves it.The Russo's have upped the ante with their last outing, Infinity War and raised the bar for this so high. Boy did they do it better this time. The writing, directing and acting is incredible. With so many characters and superheroes, each one of them gets a chance to shine which is not an easy feat but the writers managed to do it.This is a 3 hour long movie but I didn't feel bored for a second. Such was the writing and direction. It has drama, humour, emotions, kinetic action and visual extravaganza. No spoilers, but towards the end of the movie all the super heroes from MCU come together and it is an absolute heart-stopping moment when Captain America says ""Avengers assemble"".The movie is going to leave you laughing, surprised and shocking by some twists, posibbly gasping and screaming. The ending is gonna make you emotional but you will leave the theater with a satisfying smile.Kudos to the Russo's, writers, Kevin Fiege and the entire Marvel team for this. Just go watch the movie and you will not be disappointed.",positive
"This looks to be a bit unpopular opinion but here goes: Endgame couldn't hold the standards of Infinity War, and felt a little bit too silly at start.**What I liked:**Doctor Hulk. I was really waiting for his appearance, I loved that they brought the character in. I just wish he had more action going on, and would've started smashing with Bruce's intelligence.Time-traveling scenes: These scenes were so good. Going back to older films, you recognize the scenery and re-live the moments in another perspective. Bruce talking about Dr.Strange with the Ancient one, and Tony meeting up with his father were ultimately the best scenes of the movie.Captain America wielding Mjölnir. This was the climax of the film for me personally. The fight the Avengers had between Thanos only was pure eye/lore candy. I wish more Avengers had a bit more personal scenery with Thanos, thus this is the one that mostly was left on my mind.Tony stealing the infinity stones, and wielding them on his hand was a breathtaking and satisfying scene.Lots of scenes with Hawkeye. He felt a bit irrelevant on earlier films, but they actually presented him quite strong in this one. Very well received from my part.There was also lot of small details, but the one I liked the most was with Dr.Strange. At the end, right before Tony gets the stones, he looks at Stephen and Stephen is showing 1 with his fingers, implying this is the 1 in the 14 million chance. You could see Stephen's finger shaking from the accident he had.
**What I didn't like:**With Infinity War, I could feel tension through out the whole movie, the movie itself was a masterpiece. Here though, after the initial events of Infinity War, the buildup before time traveling felt utterly filler-y to me.Thor's started finally to shine in Ragnarok and Infinity War, and they made him silly comical relief. I felt like they went too much with it and it didn't really bring me enjoyment watching this character.Doctor Hulk wasn't introduced at all, and for the casual viewers with no information about comics might be a bit confused. I think showing Banners and Hulk's merging would've been much better screen time to what we saw.In the final battle, we had way too much side heroes / characters which really killed my emotional attachment. In Infinity War, we had many scenes showing most of the main heroes fight, and those scenes gave me shivers. However, apart from couple good moments, I didn't have those feelings like I had in Infinity War.Leading up to Tony's death, I wasn't as emotionally invested as in Infinity War's climax, thus I didn't cry. I don't think the scene itself was worse than IF's climax, but it was just the fact that a I felt a lot more disconnected to the film.Cpt.Marvel is too OP. Her entrance just killed all the tension as it became obvious, and not even close to who is going to be the winner here.
**Conclusion**I rated Infinity War 10/10. I think this film didn't really live up to the hype I had, was a bit filler-y at times and was just too cluttered with too many side-heroes at the ending battle. My honest personal subjective opinion is going to be 8/10.",positive
This is by far my favorite movie ever every one NEEDS to go watch it in the theater there is so much action at times andyou will not be able to get everything on a normal screen ... It's not comparable to any thing else.. I laughed i cried and even after over 24 hours . I smiled when the battles happened i loved it all for a 3 hour movie you don't feel it.. I'm going to leave it here because i don't want to go spoilery,positive
"And we are the punchline. You can see throughout the film that the central theme was how stupid the viewers are to pay that much money for hype and CGI. You have nothing we haven't seen, doing things we have seen, even into the past like one of those ""best moments of this series"" finale episodes where all they do is reminisce about the past by revisiting it.Now I love time travel films as much as anyone, it's probably my favorite genre, but for these guys to start jumping around using something Tony Stark figured out in what, a day or two? Wow... Tony never considered time travel till someone suggested it. Then they travel to get the stones, but of course each one would go somewhere that had deep meaning to them. So not only do they travel in time, they travel in space. So much for needing Cumberbatch to do that.Then Thanos, the only character with any depth, even if he does need to replace his razor cartridge now and then, is stupid enough to actually not get that the time travel means someone could know exactly what he would do. At that point you're defeated. I would say it's too bad Iron Man croaks out, but it's about time someone does. Who didn't know Scarlett would be the one to take the plunge? She had no one in her life and probably the actress has zero plans on ever doing another one. Same with Robert Downey Jr however because it's MCU they can do anything they like, they can resurrect these folks with the same stupid time trick.Guardians of the Galaxy is the only saving grace here and even they had such a small part overall that it's pointless. Thor is a fat tub of lard who's beard recovers but not his gut. The thing they did with the Hulk was another big middle finger to fans of the series. It wasn't cute or funny in the least. It was creepy. Much of it was creepy and felt like they mailed it in.Why do these series finales seem to always be troll jobs? This one was. Oh boo hoo daddy died but a cheeseburger sounds good.And why did Thanos need the stones in the 1st place? He was wiping the floor with all of them even without the stones. So much for God of Thunder and Hulk. The rest I can understand, mostly human with skills, but Thor being treated like a toy after he beat the beasts he has, that's funny. I guess without Led Zepplin playing, Thor is just a big wimp.I wasn't impressed. Too much brand chest thumping, not much in the way of movie. Glad I waited for this to be on cheapy view.",positive
"It was more of a celebration than a movie. Beautiful storyline, stunning visuals, power-packed and great performance from everyone involved. Movie of the decade.",positive
"First of all I haven't seen the movie on IMAX or 3d format, I have seen it on 2D. I wish could have experienced in on IMAX because the movie has been shot entirely with IMAX cameras. Endgame's plot doesn't work for me all the time travel thing was messy. It can be suitable for comics but cinematic universe should has been different. First hour of the movie was slow, it could be shortened but I like first hour because it showed us heroes struggles and their human side for example, Cap was in a therapy group and iron man's relationship with his daughter. when the movie approaches the end it dragges you so 3 hours long doesn't bother you. on the other hand, I can't say that Endgame is better than Infinity war or vice versa. Both movies have their own moments I think Endgame's emotional tone was better but Infinity war's humor and battle scenes were better. I feel disappointed final battle of Endgame it was concluded too quickly Russo brothers' battle scenes in Civil war and Infinity war were better than Endgame. I was very angry with absence of Hulk Infinity war but I liked him in in this movie and I also liked Thor and Rocket too. Lastly, I am pleased Iron man and Cap's endings and also widow's their fates in the movie was very emotional. Although, its ridiculous time-travel plot it has its own moments completes 22 films's integrated saga. I give 7 point out of 10.",positive
"A Titan approach is required to restore order back to this ridiculously high film rating....The first act is a series of cliches that does not inspire.The second act is the ever reliable and cheap device of time travel to make everything ok again.The third act is a few moments of sacrificial giving to pull on hearts strings via characters we have already grown to like.And this ladies and gents is what happens when you properly invest in a franchise, you can basically get away with a crappy grab for cash and a last hurrah.If it were not for the nostalgia and sheer enjoyment of seeing marvel characters in one fight scene this screenplay would have presented as written by high school kids.But no, we have worse, virtue signalling Hollywood types, who are in an insular sound bubble that insist that girl power must prevail on the big screen. Once again the ticket buying fans of fly over states are treated like they don't exist.",negative
"One of the "" MASTER PIECE "" from the team Avengers. This is combination of all movies released from the "" MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE"".

"This is for the MCU fans, a truly heartfelt, emotional 3 hour journey into characters we have grown to love over the last 11 years.
It's not perfect, they took huge risks, some I didn't like, others I loved!
A Few things to know:
It's light on action (until the last hour) In favour of telling a slower story and letting the characters simmer in a scene.
Take tissues
Don't take a toilet break
There are no after credit scenes.

"This was my fifth time to watch this movie , I still remember how I was hyped before it released , as we know Avengers endgame is the end of an era to most of the beloved characters , but is it the end of an era deserved ? . Without a shadow of doubt , my answer is YES !!! . This how you end a franchise and start a new one . For me this movie had a numerous positive aspects . First and for most , the acting . This movie has a great number of well-known , talented actors .
For example , Chris Hemsworth one of the best thing in this movie , his performance was stunning by which he made me show sympathy to his character and on the same time he can turn it into a comedy situation, if this not a great performance I don't know what it is , and of course RDJ one of the greatest actors to a comic book character , irreplaceable and astonishing . Some people say they ruined characters like Thor and professor hulk or it was pointless to turn them like this .....oh wait what if Bruce banner snapped his finger without being hulk or what if hulk snapped his finger without Bruce mind ? In both ways it won't work one will die and the other is stupid enough to ruin it ,but what if we combined the power with the mind , think about it again please . Some people say they could've saved tony or whatever okay let's talk about what if they did , if you were concentrating it will create another timeline they would lose in it so Ironman was really satisfying. Everyone did great job there actually . Secondly , the soundtrack that never failed to add suspense to most of the scenes . And The CGI was perfectly done . Thank you Russo bros for giving us one of the best movies in the last decade , for me it was the best .",positive

Great movie ! So much in the end and the flashbacks made it all make sense. All 22 movies and they end with this. Great movie,positive
"7/10I have been a mcu fan and have watched all the movies over the years. Some were better than others.
I certainly loved Infinity War. I laughed at the jokes and enjoyed the fast paced narrative. To me that movie still
represents the zenith of mcu. I have lost count of the number of times I have watched it.Thanos's actions were coherent and at no point did I feel that I need to put my brain in a jar to enjoy the movie.
The writing was very good.With Endgame the same is not true. The humor is simply not as good. The pacing is slow for the first 2 hours.How does it make sense for Thanos to destroy the gems? Does he not know that he will be a sitting duck without the Gems?
He has always wanted the power of the stones to make him the god that he wants to be. Not just to kill
half the population. But to rule the universe. So this movie somewhat misrepresents Thanos's character.Thor's appearance & conduct in this movie is an insult to the character. He deserves better than to be a joke.
I actually wanted to see more of Captain Marvel. But she just comes and goes. Why make an elaborate origin movie for her and then
have her play such a small role? Still her small contribution is actually entertaining to watch.
Even in the final battle, she plays a crucial role. In fact one gets the feeling that she has been deliberately sidestepped so that
other heroes get more screen time. Fact is if she can take down an entire space ship within seconds, what are the rest of
the Avengers going to do to make themselves useful? Lets hope the next phase of MCU shows us more of her.Then they have bunched together all the action in the final battle in the last 45 minutes where everyone fights Thanos and his army.
Those battle scenes are not as well choreographed as Infinity war. Also its hard to believe that Tony, Steve and Thor with both the hammers cannot fight
Thanos even when he has no gems. Whereas Thor alone nearly killed him in Infinity War.The best scene is between Cap Marvel and Thanos where he punches her hard and she doesn't even budge! Its like he hit metal!
We needed more of that. In the comics Thor is supposed to be stronger but here, she seems the strongest.I am not even going into all the paradoxes that time travel creates. You really have to completely stop asking rational questions there.
Overall many scenes seem contrived and designed to close out this chapter of MCU. Tony's death is actually unnecessary once he has all the Gems.
But his death is necessary for the future stories since he always occupies centre stage and in the future they probably want Cap Marvel or others to take on a leadership role for the Avengers.Overall, it's not as coherent as Infinity War but its fun and closes the chapter.
I just hope they bring back the coherent story telling with better writing in the next phase.",positive
"This movie is so much childish. Whats wrong with you guys , i mean first thanos snap his fingers and then you guys did the same 😂

"Not much to say other than without a doubt the best Marvel movie made to date! A fantastic, emotional, well scripted film that will leave you feeling fulfilled.....but with also a couple of unanswered questions! I can't say anymore than go watch this film!",positive

Direction is flalwless, there is no part where you feel like ""waiting"". The screenplay has done a very nice job solving many question, although is not perfect. In any way you want to see it, The Avengers Endgame does not dissapoint, and it will be recalled as the best finale ever made for a saga, for many years to come",positive
Its different now without Iron Man. MCU have to make something new. its not just the graphics but the story.,positive
"Alright, the movie was great. At the start my reaction was ""wtf am I watching"". At the end I still didn't know what I was watching, but I gave it a 10.Most of the people rating below 10 here object to some specific thing. Here is my perspective to the most common objections:1) ""didn't like the new Thor""
Sure, it's not the Thor you know, you love, you expect, but it's real. He lost everything, he's devastated, he's not the same Thor. He looks messed up and he is. The best part of Marvel is how the characters grow and change. This is Marvel at its finest.Also, as a sidenote, his journey is parallel to his journey in recent comics, where he loses an arm instead of an eye and establishes new asgard on earth after asgard is devastated.2) ""didn't like the new Hulk""
Most people really wanted Hulk to let loose and be badass destroying machine. It would have been cool, but it would have taken another sideplot and scene to get professor hulk into rage hulk. Instead they let captain marvel be the destroyer. Well, since it isn't the last Hulk movie it wasn't mandatory for him to have a scene... On the other hand, cap and Iron man scenes were mandatory. So not a huge deal.Also, some people didn't like the merged hulk, smart in big body. Even Valkyrie says it in the movie!! It was new and different. This was also comics based. In peter david's 90s run he explored all sorts of different hulks including at least one which was big and smart.It's just part of the characters growth, banner was always depressed and angry. Now he's happy! I also liked his humor, which reminded me of RDJ humor, which I think is critical for Marvel going forward. So, overall it was cool and interesting.3) ""First part of the movie was too slow""
In my opinion Infinity war was too much action. I had no idea what they would do and I liked how they struggled with that same exact question WHAT DID WE DO? The scenes were funny and great character development in the meantime, so I liked it even though I had no clue where it was going.4) ""the time travel didn't make sense""
Okay everybody, it didn't make sense, because time travel doesn't make sense. It was a plot device to revisit moments from the past to remind us of a decade of awesome moments... And it was awesome!!!!5) ""The captain america ending doesn't make sense with how time travel works""
Ya hulk told you how time travel works and you believed him!!!! Haha j/k. Forget trying to figure out how it works. In the original script cap died in the battle. Cap and iron man both dying in the battle is a bit too generic. This ending for cap mirrors the comics where he ages. It's true to the character whose struggle was always balancing his personal life, robbed from him by his 80 years in ice. Iron man's death was true to his character who went from selfish jerk playboy to giving everything for the world and his daughter. So no the time travel didn't make sense, but deal with it.6) ""why did they get rid of cap/iron man/black widow""
There contracts were up, it's been a while. We all love RDJ iron man. But we don't need a 60 year old RDJ iron man, time to let go.7) ""why was Hawkeye even in this movie I hate him""
Well they set up his family previously so he was the poster boy for everyone he loved being lost. Yes, everyone hates Hawkeye because he's not that pretty in the face and he's not a billionaire playboy. He did well in his role and was a pivotal part of lending weight to the dusting of IW.8) ""why was there a women's march ""
Haha, well it was a bit silly, but for I'm sure for a lot of little girls and big ones it will make a difference in their life, Don't take away their moment.9) ""I hate everything!!""
No u don't!",positive
"I cant describe this movie, you just have to go and watch it, i just saw it today and i sobbed the whole way through especially at the end, and as soon as i went home i went to sleep cause i couldn't handle my emotions and i woke up and just sobbed watched youtube videos, interviews, etc, i just don't think i'll ever get over this movie. this isn't the end, but it's the end of an era and part of the journey is the end but i never knew the end would hurt so much. i know it's weird to feel this way about a movie but to me movies are an escape and seeing these stories especially this one come to life and be told it just hurts for it all to end but it was a spectacular end. rip iron man you started this whole journey and thank you for a beautiful decade, thank you robert downey jr, i wish i could thank the whole cast and everyone apart of this universe and special thanks to stan lee. this is a movie for the fans, so enjoy it.",positive

"Avengers: Endgame, the culmination of eleven years of storytelling spanning twenty-two movies, represents a very peculiar time in the history of film. It is at once an incredibly ambitious project and the product of twenty-two mostly reasonable, inoffensive films made to appeal to the broadest audience possible. It is a celebration of something I'm not sure should be celebrated, the concentration of the box office and blockbuster culture at the expense of artistry, done so by an aggressive corporation that conquers more and more of Hollywood's creative landscape each day.And it's absolutely magnificent.Endgame is the sequel to last year's Infinity War, an average movie elevated by a truly shocking ending. For the first time, we went into our twice-a-year dose of Marvel movie expecting the expected victory and were greeted with bitter defeat. Our heroes had been tossed aside, their ideals shattered and in many cases lives ended, all to give this purple raisin man a happy ending complete with a farm and an infuriating little grin. It was incredible because it was unexpected, and unexpected not because it wasn't a possibility, but within the Marvel Cinematic Universe the concept of the unexpected seemed as foreign to their writers as original storytelling.To say I dislike the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be an overstatement. I have seen all twenty-two of its installments, and while liking only a few of them, there have been fewer still that I've actively disliked. For the most part, they've been perfectly reasonable ways to spend a couple hours on a Saturday afternoon, undercut by low stakes and the inevitable joke that follows every dramatic moment.But although Endgame is a part of this franchise, its storytelling feels decidedly different. Where the MCU is comical, Endgame is dramatic. Where the MCU is superficial, Endgame is expansive and thorough. Where the MCU is formulaic, Endgame is unpredictable. Where the MCU is cynical, Endgame is emotional. And where the MCU is always building to a conclusion that it seems will never come, Endgame is that conclusion. Of course, this isn't to say it doesn't retain some elements of what's made the MCU so popular. The humour and characterization are there, though a little less fleshed out than in previous installments.This relative lack of characterization and humour makes sense given the context of the film. We've already seen twenty other films, which served not only the purpose of building to where we are now but familiarizing us with the characters that populate this story. Understanding it felt rewarding, as if I'd studied for the last ten years and proceeded to do well on the exam, a feeling I'm hardly familiar with. And what characterization there is is generally well thought out, even if the dialogue lacks the snappiness of Whedon's takes on the franchise.But what the film does have is power. Emotional moments take center stage, with more a scene than not delivering a tear-inducing moment, doubtlessly rendering the invested viewer an emotional wreck by the time the credits roll. The Russos very clearly understand that they're delivering the final adventure - at least of this particular saga - and imbue their film with powerful nostalgia enhanced by melancholy and exhilaration in equal measure.This isn't to say Endgame is a masterpiece. The story's logic often threatens to cave down on itself and the film as a whole is somewhat short on action. Thor's arc isn't handled nearly as gracefully as the others, which is a shame because he became one of the more interesting Avengers after Ragnarok and arguably the most after Infinity War. The pacing of individual scenes occasionally feels unnecessarily drawn out, usually to service a limp punch-line that reduces whatever emotion the respective scene was striving towards. The second act feels underdeveloped compared to the first and the third, offering an interesting concept while failing to exploit its thematic potential. But there are moments when all the pieces come together, delivering something it seems only this film can, a soaring, kinetic, exhilarating joy that had my audience applauding and me wanting to. And it's moments like these when Endgame is untouchable.How the hell they follow this up is a question for a new era of actors, storytellers, and the corporation that towers over them all. But I'm going to bet that they don't.As for me, I think I'm finished with superhero movies. That being said, they've been putting smiles on my face and tears in my eyes for almost my entire life, and for that I'm grateful.",positive
"Took a while to process my thoughts and gather words. Still haven't recovered from the existential crisis this film caused because I don't feel like wanting anything anymore because I feel like it gave me everything I needed. Nothing feels exciting anymore maybe because I won't be anticipating anything as much as I anticipated this for a very long time. So I am just sitting here questioning life, hope I snap out of it soon (no pun intended)When a film is a culmination of 21 films and about 11 years of hard work, it becomes immune to criticism because then it's more than just a film. This is just an attempt to put my thoughts down in words, show gratitude and say goodbye.Endgame subverted expectations and got everything it needed to address from the ending of Infinity War right out of the way to kick off the actual story of this movie, which made it quite unpredictable because there was still over two hours left.Since spoilers aren't allowed, I would say the underlying logic behind certain science fiction elements this film involves might be questionable to some degree but the way they handled it by embracing the light hearted side of MCU and cleverly poked fun at it in hilarious ways which somehow worked, you had no option but to go along anyway especially once the tension filled second act goes into some crazy unexpected directions that kept me on the edge of my seat.Some may argue the first half is slow or that it's not as inventive as some of the previous great MCU films but they were in a corner after what happened at the end of Infinity War which was nothing short of perfect. This film had to follow through on that and it delivered and that's all I needed.It also somehow managed to pay tribute to all three first phases and almost every single important character without compromising the story and by weaving all the homages and references brilliantly in exactly the right places. It provided closure to everything they have been setting up slowly over the years and I tip my hat to Marvel Studios for being able to pull that off.The entire last act of this movie is just COMIC BOOK MOVIE HISTORY and MOVIE HISTORY. I COULD NOT BELIEVING WHAT I WAS WITNESSING. That's all I can say to describe how absolutely insane and balls to the walls crazy it was. I can't come up with words for the things this movie and this universe made feel throughout the years. I honestly feel like my life's over, like I've gotten everything I ever wanted.And for that, Thank you Kevin Feige, Thank you to the trinity of MCU - Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr who brought their characters to life and a standing ovation to Russo Brothers who not only made such a massive event work but exceeded my expectations regarding what MCU could be. This universe is an achievement that will go down as one of the most influential achievements in film history.To everyone involved with the MCU, Love you all 3000. I don't think I'll ever be able to thank everyone involved for how much they have influenced my life and those who will continue to do so going forward. And I can never be too grateful to the man himself, Stan Lee. Excelsior.I can't rate this because no matter what rating I give, some will say I'm overrating while some will say I'm underrating it. Though I may add a placeholder rating for IMDB.I hate to say goodbye to this era of MCU but this is goodbye. I honestly can't believe it's been more than 11 years since I first watched RDJ suiting up as Iron Man in the first MCU film. I used to watch that film in wonder and amazement and now we are here with such a massive universe with these iconic characters. MCU will go on but man, I'll miss everything about this era of MCU. Farewell (for now)",positive
"Too bad there isn't a zero star rating. I am not the target demo, was dragged to the movie theater by my young son to see it (he thought the movie was OK. I didn't.1. Lots of nothing much happens
2. Lots of melodramatic music
3. The movie at 182 minutes is about 82 minutes too long
4. The Thor character ceases to become comic amusement about a third through the pic
5. Incomprehensible and repeated fight scenes
6. Exceptionally poor dialog in the screenplayVisually the only star turns were Brie Larson and Elizabeth Olsen. The Scarlet Witch, one of the stronger themes was barely in this - Olsen should get her own movie.I was three hours of my life back plus $68 bucks spent on tickets and popcorn at AMC.",negative
If you invested in all of the films that came before it then you will probably be very happy. Are there plot holes? Sure. Is anything in the movie probable at all in the real world? No. It's a movie. Go into it with an open mind and enjoy the ride. Nice job Russo's.,positive
It was a fitting end to Marvel's 11 year plan. The only thing I had a problem with was the confusing time travel. I'm excited for the next phase of Marvel.,positive
"But I don't want to nitpick around here so it's the best ending possible. The 1 in 14 million versions.But I'll start with what didn't work. Firstly, captain Marvel. Why is she even in this movie? She's totally unnecessary and she really felt like a hero from the next generation where the villains are way worse than Thanos (hopefully).Second, Hulk transformation is delivered in dialogue only. The complete reverse of show, don't tell.Second, quantum realm. Everything make sense, there's no obvious plot holes if you believe the character's explanation on how things work but it's a little bit disappointing and it's not as straightforward as in the previous Avengers. Personally, I liked the focus on Thanos in Infinity War, he didn't come as shallow as other villains but in this one the focus is on the Avengers and Thanos is reduced to the villain that conveniently overthrows the heros' plans.It's the classic superhero movie, only bigger, better, more awesome than ever. I was glued to the screen the whole 3 hours but still, I will remember Infinity War forever. And this would have been amazing (and completely different) movie if they just show how superheroes continued their lives after the decimation of the Universe without being able to do anything about it. Instead we get a fitting closure for the heroes that started the Avengers and we are ready to move into a new Era.*spoiler*
I cried.",positive
"Show some respect, I mean the movie is the best of its generation 3000 times. Why do people give it down ratings?!! This movie deserves the most
3000 more than you do.",positive
"After watching Avengers Infinity War everyone who watched that film had a question ""what is going to happen next?' and this film answer our every single question. This is not just a film, this an experience that you will never forget.",positive
"Historical from start to finish! This film should be nominated for best picture and best actor for Robert Downey Jr. He has been an icon since 2008 leading 11 years playing iron man. It was very hard for me to see him die, but it was for a purpose and I cried when that happened. Not to mention I was about to cry when Nat died and that brought me to a shock! Plus when Captain America returned the stones back to their timelines and spent the rest of his life with peggy he knew he wanted a happy ending and giving up his shield and being a hero and passing it to Sam was the right thing to do. When Spider-Man far from home comes out Peter Parker is going to go through a lot of grief now that his mentor is gone and having to bear all this grief by himself but this may give him a sense of courage and be a true avenger. I'll be anxious to see what happens next in the MCU and im ready for a lot of new stories,but Avengers Endgame is a classic that'll be successful in the generations to come!",positive
"Time traveling cliché... At the end of the last part I wished that this part would not be a ""Back to the future"" kind of plot. I mean, it could be more... Um.. Coherent. In addition, the unexpected quick pace of events. The time traveling plot is so controversial, you can't just make your own theory of time traveling and shove it down our throats. In conclusion, it was a fun movie but as a fan, sorry, you could've done it better.",positive
Keeping this short. Movie is awesome only if you have watched majority of the movies that led up to this. It is a bit long but I'm a diehard so I don't mind. Only thing I had wished they done differently is Thor. I get he is depressed and all but they sort of make a joke out of it. The time travel is confusing at first but after watching some YouTube videos you will understand...sorta,positive
"I enjoyed this as a popcorn movie, but parts of it made no logical sense to me. For example, if Nebula only had one Pim's capsule, how on earth did Thanos AND Gamora AND past Nebula travel to the future? Also, if people are traveling forward on their own timeline (as they suggested) then how can they travel forward to a timeline where they are already dead? Makes no sense.",positive
"Very cheap dialogues
Time traveling does not make any sense with major holes
But dialogues are the biggest hole in this movie
There are some serious nonsense in the movie
I know it's super heroes and fantasy
But at least try to make me believe",negative
"Avengers Endgame is the culmination of 11 years of movies, in this vast universe of comics, as a fan since the first iron man movie, which hooked, I thought that the Winter Soldier was the best Marvel movie, but Infinity War and Endgame made me To think twice, this movie is something truly epic, I had not seen something like this since the Lord of the Rings: the return of the king, and even that has plot holes, and that he makes the same mistakes as his predecessor Infinity war brothers Russo did an incredible job together with the whole cast, it's one of those movies to watch before he dies, this movie does put an ""End"" on this Infinity Saga.",positive
Worth watching.. an emotional journey with lots of memories.. marvel's best movie ever..,positive
Infinity War was better. I expected from Endgame less humor and more thrilling scenes but that's ok.,positive
"This was a great movie, but I wasn't as satisfied as a lot of other people who gave this movie a perfect 10 and I definitely found some problems with this movie which took away from the experience.Things I liked:
All the fanservice. Seeing so many familiar faces and locations from the MCU was great.The unexpectedness of the events of the movie, given that they kill Thanos in the beginning and the 5 year time-jump that follows.How the movie handles both emotional depth and humor.There were a lot of great memorable individual scenes (Tony talking with his dad, Hawkeye and Black Widow's struggle to get the soul stone, the plan to get the Tesseract failing the first time, Cap saying ""Hail Hydra"" and ""Avengers Assemble"", Cap using Mjolnir, Tony's ""I am Iron Man"", etc.).All of the main characters got some important moments (Hawkeye and Ant-Man deserved them).The final battle and the scene where all Avengers show up was just fantastic.Tony and Cap got great send-off's.Things I did not like:
Thor. I get why he is this way, from both a narrative standpoint and because he would overpower Thanos if they did not go this route, but he's just a joke throughout the movie while he was one of my favourites in IW. He just wasn't satisfying here, but since this is not his last movie it is not a big problem.Hulk. I liked his fusion with Banner but he doesn't do any fighting at all. Where is his well-deserved rematch with Thanos? I really feel like he is underused in the MCU.The whole time-travel plotline leaves some plotholes, like how Captain America ended up in the same timeline as where he started in the ending of the movie and how Thanos, Gamora and his Black Order teleported to the future without having any Pym particles. If you can transport objects like Thanos' ship with multiple people inside through time, could the main crew not have done that when they split up to save up on Pym particles? Some of the plotholes can be resolved if you assume other things, but the fact that you have to do this, that these plotholes where never explained or addressed at all is already a problem.Thanos. This is by far the biggest problem of the movie for me. The 2014 Thanos is way more one-dimensional than the Thanos from IW. They spend an entire movie developing him just to throw that all away, and it lessens the impact of the final fight sequence (as glorious as it is) and makes it feel a little anticlimactic.The main conflict of the movie (bringing everyone from the snap back to life) is resolved right before the climax of the movie, making the actual climax and the plotline of 2014 Thanos going to the future feel slightly out of left field, again lessening the impact of the final fight and Tony's sacrifice.Some of these negatives are definitely nitpicks, but they did impact my enjoyment of the movie and I felt IW was the better movie. This was still a great watch overall though and I would recommend it to fans of the MCU.8/10 for me.",positive
"There really are no words that anyone can use to describe this film. But if I had to put it into one word, it would be ""Spoilers"". See it if you haven't.",positive
"Can I just say firstly I am a huge fan of superheroes in general I'm not a DC hater or a Marvel hater I live and breathe superheroes. Now as a massive Superman fan (no-one will budge me) I will always be biased that being said this movie was amazing.
Was it as WOW as Infinity War? No! But what it gave us was what I tried to explain to others and that is the message I thought it delivers - Goodbyes and Closure.
It was funny emotional and there were some moments where you couldn't help but think hell yeah!!! And I also got to say Captain America for once didn't come across as too straight laced as in previous films. The bit that choked me up was Spider-Man and Iron Man seeing each other again. Really emotional. Ever since I've watched this all I want to do is watch Infinity War.
Loved all the references and nods to previous films made it more final.
Go and see it - I am so glad I stayed away from spoilers and trailers",positive
"They made it that way on purpose, so that most people would have to say ""yes, we think we understand, yea..."" so not to look like a bunch of idiots. There's power in the denial!
But go watch it for the laughs, I'm not a type of person to cringe over a cheesy joke, but whoever was responsible for comedy relief this time around has gotten to me! Was it RDJ? He a genuinely funny guy.I rate this sci-fi fantasy:
6/10
-1 for over the top CGI,
-2 for deus ex machina,
-1 for trying to make me feel for too many characters! Because I can't do lazy writing.
and -1 for shameless AUDI plug but I won't go below 6.",positive
"Avengers Endgame from a technical standpoint is a downgrade from the previous Infinity War. But what it lacks in technicality and overall quality it more or less make it up with emotions, stakes and an abundance of fanservice.The pacing is fairly inconsistent, storytelling botched and action sequences minimal. Rather the Russo brothers put emphasis on character development over plot, which were basically more or less presented in the last movie. And the characters were mostly handled pretty well except for one character, which I wont spoil.Endgame is less of a movie, more of a love letter to the fans that stayed with the MCU ever since Tony Stark built a suit in a cave. It's the Russo brothers way of letting you know that they heard us and they want to satisfy what we want to see, and they did just that and even more.I do have few gripes with few parts of the movie but the pay off in the end is insurmountable. A near perfect, nay perfect conclusion to the Infinity Gauntlet storyline which will have you come back here time after time only to watch the third act one more time.
Movies hardly pay off as good as this.",positive
"I very much loved this movie, though the beginning act was very slow and drawn out making the film almost boring. The second and third act saved the movie as those were the best parts.",positive
"If you've been loving the MCU films recently, then this will probably be your favorite one yet. It's absolutely jammed packed with material, and the more MCU films you've seen, the better it'll be.However, the movie is dragged down by an extensive runtime, and jokes that miss the mark. Endgame takes too long to get going, and then seemingly never ends. And most of the humor is hit or miss; it just feels out of place.Overall, Endgame wraps up the Avengers ark reasonably well, but it's too arrogant and lacks any real sense of quality.",negative
"Avengers: Endgame is the epicenter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie encapsulates everything that we have been waiting for since Iron Man. Because it is in fact a Marvel movie, the base level of quality is of course high. This includes acting, score, visual effects, cinematography, etc. Endgame is comparable to Infinity War except it does more. This movie shows our favorite Avengers at not only their lowest, but also at their highest both emotionally and physically. Hawkeye grows as a character, Rocket grows, Banner grows, Thor GROWS. Captain America gets an incredible amount of growth as a character as well but nowhere near as much as Tony Stark. The movie takes the characters we love so much and gives us a glimpse into what it feels to lose like they did. The plot is witty and engaging all the way through and the shifts in tone make sense and transition smoothly. My two gripes with this film which is very close to a 5/5 are the main antagonist that is fought at the very end of the film and the inclusion of Captain Marvel. In my opinion she is the only piece of this movie that seems out of place. If I were to describe this movie in only one word, that word would be epic.",positive
"Before walking into the theater I thought of a dozen different ways this movie could possibly play out, but it was none of those. It progresses in a make-sense but surprising fashion that I've never seen in any other movies. Not to say it doesn't have plot holes, but I happily embrace it because I honest believe no one could've done a better job in writing the story. Great job Marvel and thank you for pulling this off!",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is a culmination of 11 years of cinematic superhero movies that have entertained us on different levels all throughout the years. 22 movies come to an explosive ending here and if the word 'epic' ever had any meaning, this movie would be it. Truly a visceral experience that leaves you heartbroken and shocked from all the events and the insane number of characters and story-lines that they intervene.
I loved pretty much everything about this movie, it was indeed a bit slow at the start but I didn't mind as the ending is probably the most spectacular thing I have ever experienced in a cinema.
Everyone does an amazing job at acting, but my stand out would be Jeremy Renner who truly shines as Hawkeye. The Russo brothers have accomplished an incredible feat and the entire 181 minutes of this film, serve as minutes that will go down in the history of cinema for decades to come.",positive
"What can I say? This was by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time (maybe ever). Absolute perfection! I'd like to thank anyone and everyone who was involved in creating this masterpiece! Honestly, I don't know how the geniuses over at Marvel think this stuff up! Bringing 21 movies to an epic climax in Endgame really took some doing; and they nailed it!!
This is now the new bar all other movies of this type will be measured against! A complete master class in how it should be done! Everything was just right - the story, the action, the visual effects, the love and emotion, the heart break, the laughs, the twists, the music, the dialogue, the fan service - all of it was just tuned to perfection!Spoilers Below:In Endgame we see the end of 3 main characters - Black Widow, Captain America and Iron Man. To say it's emotional is an understatement. We have known these characters for over a decade, and saying goodbye is not easy! It was gut wrenching to see Iron Man die. It sucked to see Black Widow falling to her death... Have to admit though that it was nice see Captain America get what he always wanted, so I'm happy for him - just very sad to see him go.Overall - this movie is a masterpiece, a true definition of the Art of in film making. We, as fans, thank you all so much for your hard work and dedication.I honestly wish Stan Lee was alive to have witnessed this, he would have been so proud!!",positive
"OUTSTANDING bittersweet end to a long cinematic saga brilliant performances by RDJ ,,,,,SCARJO,,,,,CHRIS EVANS .... Well done to all the cast crew and the writers and directors of this film for pulling this story of and giving us the best that the MCU HAS TO OFFER....
I only hope that i can continue to follow along for the next phase hopefully THE MCU WILL avoid the SJW crap, BUT i fear that, that is where we are heading its been a wild ride and this might be my last stop.",positive
"This is truly cinema. It's a movie that makes us want to go to thw theaters multiple times to watch and rewatch. It's a reward to years of dedication by fans and moviemakers in a new form of storytelling unlike anything before and unlike anything to come. There hasn't been and there won't be anything like Avengers storyline ever again. Martjns Scorcese is just an old mummy jealous that this movie almost made 3 billion in box office, while his Irishman was too boring that we sleep 3 times before concluding it. Also, I'm sorry James Cameron, but Avatar is terrible when compared to this.",positive
"The movie was great but not perfect. It doesn't deserve a 10/10 in my opinion.
Few of the things I didn't like.
1. Professor Hulk was good but at the end the angry hulk should have come out to fight Thanos and Help cap. I think the huge battle at the end was too much to handle. The fight between Thanos vs. Cap, iron man and Thor was epic. Hulk should have been joining that to close the circle from first avengers.2. Captain Marvel is just too strong. Marvel made a mistake there creating her like that. It didn't make any sense in comparison to all the other superheros. Where was she until the last 5 minutes of the movie?3. Drunk fat Thor was great gimmick but at the end Thor should have gone to be himself again in the fight against Thanos. Cap isn't as strong but he hold up much longer versus Thanos. It's a bad choice for Marvel.4. Time travel has always a lot of flaws in it especially when it creates new parallels of reality. The plot lost a lot of credibility over this.Movie was good but it wasn't perfect.",positive
I LOVED every minute of Endgame. Thank you for such an amazing ride!,positive
"Okay, firstly, this was a stunning movie, it looked really beautiful throughout. That being said, I thought Infinity War was a far superior story than this one. I am not really complaining, because I don't think any sequel could have been better than Infinity War. I don't like time travel as a means of solving things, or at least, it really needs to be done well for me to appreciate using it (Interstellar did it well). I thought initially they could have done it well, because I mentioned that you cannot change the past, but then that is exactly what they ended up doing. Also, why was Captain America able to use Thor's hammer? In fact, why did Thor take it from Asgard in the first place? Wouldn't that leave the past Thor hammerless? I feel like they played it a bit fast and lose with consistency in terms of what the characters could and should have done and be able to do. This movie left me a little confused about Thanos' power because he was pretty powerful without the stones. Also, I really wish they would have had more heroes die. I mean they fought an army and only Nat, who sacrificed herself, and Tony, who died from his own actions, died, that just seems a copout to me and unrealistic. It would have been more emotional if a bunch of heroes had died during the battle at the end.",positive
"Story and the plot are the foundation of any movie and this film isn'tr very well in that matter. of course much superhero movies are like that however.It is obvious that we can expect things that are not rational compare to real world in sci-fi or fantasy movies so we measure them in compare to their own introduced logic. we accept some basic unnatural things and then we follow the new rules. Based on the rules the marvel universe has introduced us previously, End Game has too many holes. characters suddenly get very stronger than what they were seconds before or in compare to their history with no reason. Time traveling bugs like in all other time traveling movies present here as well. this happens also to emotional relationships between them. movie has too many cliche scenes with boring dialogs.when we compare this one to Infinity war, it is a huge disappointment. However, it is still worth watching and if you are a fan of Sci-fi, it entertains you. It is just an average superhero movie.",negative
"A perfect sendoff for the Avengers movies and the perfect sendoff for Tony and Steve both! Steve finally gets to be with Peggy via time travel (returns to present day as an 80 year old) and Tony sacrifices himself like a legit boss to rescue the world and Snap Thanos and his army.
This movie did feel like its runtime, which is 3 hrs, but not one bit of it bored me!
9.5/10",positive
"Everyone should definitely watch this! I loved it.I was kind of sad that Hulk, or Bruce Banner, doesn't get to fight much. I still enjoyed his comedy to this movie.The ending to this movie is the best of all. I was sad to see some of them die though.This is a movie that almost EVERYONE should watch! It is funny, awesome, lot of action, and more!I say second best because Infinity War was better. This did, however, have awesome action scenes. I loved every minute of this.Captain America and Iron Man may have been the highlights to this movie. Well, all of the Avengers, but you will see why I said that.",positive
A true Marvel movie with overwhelming emotions. Thank you Stan Lee!,positive
"Wow. This is more of an event than a movie. It's a spectacle. I seriously can't believe they pulled this off. What a great movie. Gave me the feels more than any other MCU movie. Such a perfect conclusion to the journey we set upon 11 years ago. MCU is too awesome. Probably the most consistently successful thing I love. I'm so proud of them. They've brought me so much joy.Amazing heart. Intriguing story that is so vast and has so many moving parts, it's a ""marvel"" they pulled it off (lame lol). Filled with beautiful shots. The acting is fantastic by so many of these actors, with some of the best performances they have ever given inside the MCU, especially Downy, Johansson, Evans, Rudd, Gillan and Renner. Some of the music gave me the chills. Lots of goosebump-inducing moments. So much character depth with some great arcs.A year later I am still in awe that they pulled this off. So many movie series and tv shows have us fully invested to an epic conclusion, only to let us down (ahem GoT ahem). This delivers on all counts. And the fact that I've given a very positive rating to every movie in the MCU except one.... I honestly feel so lucky.(8 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 4/25/2019, 5/22/2020, 7/7/2021, 7/4/2022, 4/24/2023)SPOILERSThis has the most epic battle scene in the MCU, and maybe ever in any movie. I still like the Civil War air port battle more, but this final battle was definitely more epic.This movie had three amazing conclusions to three characters and their overall arc in the series. One is a tragic sacrifice, one is a heroic save-the-universe moment, and one is possibly the most satisfying happy ending I've ever witnessed. Not just in movies, even in life rofl. Bravo. We will miss you all. (still paranoid about putting who, even a year later lol)",positive
Have to say the best film I have ever seen. If you are prone to needing toilet breaks in the cinema wear a nappy!! As you cannot leave your seat watching it. Russo brothers thank you for delivering in my eyes a truly amazing experience and I have never had my emotions on such a rollercoaster ride watching a film. This reminds me of what a cinema experience should be as knew not much about what will happen and trailers didn't reveal the good bits. It was an epic and enjoyable film no need to stay for post credits either as there is none,positive
"Film full of emotions, happiness, fun, anger and sadness, there is a bit of everything",positive
"I wanted to love it but the story doesnt make sense unlike the 21 movies before it that made all sense.
If hulk says you cant change the future by changing the past then you cant erase the alternate timelines too except make more alternate timelines by returning the stones.Returning the stones ,how did cap inject back in jane or dealt with red skull and the sacrifice ?It needed also more pace and action, infinity war was epic and this is like wtf happened.
No emotional involvment whatsoever.",positive
"The most epic MCU story ever made! Thanks to russo's brother for directed well. And thanks to K Feige, to chose russo's brother.",positive
"It is understandable that characters change due to the things that have occurred. However two characters were changed a little bit too much. Thor was changed into some sort of the dude. And clever Hulk was set up too much as funny. First one-and-a-half hour the movie was annoyingly full of cheesy, bad, simple jokes for quick laughs, they better had given Drax some more airing time. ... second part of the movie got better, but it just doesn't restore the damage already done. Luckily there is a great battle that somehow repays the money spend on a cinema ticket. Oh... and please get rid of Captain Marvel.... Dr. Strange, Iron Man, the Ancient One and Rocket (Whose BOOM-Joke was the only best funny part) were the best watchable characters and than there's just this one thing: ........ Infinity Wars was most closest to a ten and this movie just blew it!",positive
Standard story with happy end with a lot of tearful and stupid dialogs. A battle till about 10-15 mins from 3 hours.,negative
"You probably heard people reviewing comic book movies with the line 'this scene is ripped straight out of the comic book page' and with endgame it couldn't be more true. i mean the story is touching, the battle is EPIC, and the jokes are funny. and i promise you there are SO MANY SURPRISES in this movie and they're all GREAT! i have some crazy hope and really high expectation and marvel exceeded all of them. you wont feel that its 3 hour long movie because its just so good! thank god i already had another ticket on sunday.
the only critics i'd give is that i came 5 minute late :(",positive
If you love Avengers and Marvel movies you'll love this to bits. It's an epic story that never seems too long or anything like that. It's just a good watch.,positive
"Wow, woooh. Deep breath. End Game is finally here. The biggest blockbuster, the culmination of 22 movies, the end of the phase. Where do I begin? I'll just have to say it. Avengers End Game is a movie that we will look back and say that this is where it all started (or ended). It's the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's phase three and it came with two parts, Infinity War and End Game. Infinity War came in guns blazing, building tension, developing Thanos as the antithesis to the Avengers and ended with one of the most devastating scenes in the Marvel Universe. It was shocking, grandiose and jam-packed with a flurry of characters and scenes. Now, End Game has a year of build up, expectations are set, the hype remained incredible. How could the movie live up to that?I honestly believed End Game couldn't keep up with expectations. It was a save-a-world story, with huge stakes but with the Spiderman trailer dropping, suddenly it became clear to the audience that the result is clear. That the avenger's wins and Marvel will continue with its next phase. How do you come up with a story to match the stakes and tension of the previous film if the ending is already known? Well, they answered that question in the first 20 minutes when they killed the main villain, the big bad, Thanos in the first 20 minutes with one strike, a dramatic irony. A huge curveball with the expectations set. I respect the writing decision for that, it's unexpected and allowed them to explore a different type of conflict in the film. The internal conflict of the superheroes, and the end of their narrative arcs. It's more personal and human, and the tension is raised through the end/death of our favourite superheroes and their arcs.The Avenger films become harder and harder to review as it becomes less of one movie but a sequel of a multitude of movies, a ton of characters, and if people miss the previous films it becomes harder to appreciate the smaller details. Less screen time of characters leads to less character development. The movie demands you to understand these characters through the previous films. The cinematic universe gradually mirroring its comic counterparts. End Game itself comes in with a tighter narrative and smaller scope than it's predecessor due partly to the writing twist in the beginning and death of half of the characters (thank Thanos). The movie is an exploration of our central heroes arcs, motivations and fears and how they overcome it. Iron Man and Captain America have come a long way and it's a fitting end to their arcs in this movie because they resolved their central conflict. Iron Man vs Egoism/ Family and Captain America vs Authority/ The past.The movie is split into three parts. The Assemble which is the shortest and displays the consequence of the Snap did to the universe, the gathering of the heroes and how they have changed. The time travel part which is in contrast to the previous film is light-hearted and more comic and adventure in style. Lighter tension but it's made entertaining through the writer's constant strong point. The marvellous use of playing off the character's personality, resulting in witty banters, humour, and interesting character development. The last part is the conclusion of the previous conflict, the war between the Avengers and Thanos. This is the payoff and the reason why this movie felt extremely satisfying. Excellent cinematography, soundtrack, scene handling and movies upon movies of buildup led to the clash between our favourite assemble and Thanos. Incredible payoff throughout this act as we get to see all the character's and their time to shine on the golden screen. Some surprising reveals that didn't come out of anywhere such as Cap's Mjollnir scene. It's a darn good payoff, emotional, tense, and most importantly, so much fun to watch.The only negative I will add even though I didn't want to because I know it's tricky to handle something of this huge scale, with thousands of people involved in the process, is that Thanos's character growth is cut short in this movie. It's understandable given the story that led them to that moment, but I think the audience can't help feel a distinction between the Thanos in this film and the previous one. His arc ends less satisfyingly.The movie is without a doubt, a cinematic masterpiece, and an awesome blockbuster that somehow lived to the hype and makes me excited for the continuation of the Marvel Universe. It's been a long build-up and not many saw this coming, but I'm genuinely happy that I live in a time when we can get perhaps two Marvel movies a year. While not many people can say they felt that reducing the scope and epicness in this film compared to Infinity War felt right, I think it was the right choice given the direction the movie had to take. The writing is superb and makes me giddy knowing how wonderful storytelling combined with a grand vision can create. I believe in the future that we will look back at this movie and analyze its influence just as Star Wars had on the previous generation. Marvel showed us how powerful an epic saga in an interconnected film universe can produce. I can't wait for more and we will say that it all begun with this film. Wow.",positive

"Maybe because I´m an ""over 50 year old European"" (when I look at the votes) but I don´t get it. A cast filled with big names of which have very good resumes.
But this movie gives me the idea: Let´s push 1 more out ""for the team"". A team that seems to be growing with extra superheroes with every sequel.Not a movie I would watch alone, nor with my children who are 27 and 29 years of age. Maybe in 10 years time with my grandchildren but than it´s prolly outdated, like I might be atm. But these cash cow movies don´t do it for me anymore.",positive
"I've never cried so much in anything (well, since Bambi in 1992), amazing film. I can't give away any details, but it's just perfect",positive
"Unfortunately, this did not live up to the hype. Introducing new superheroes after Infinity Game reflects lazy writing. Fat Thor was a highlight and worth seeing but the final fight scene and climax were absolutely ridiculous and unimaginative. It's unbelievable how much a studio will spend on actors and advertising but not on dialing in the story line or making the defeat of the most powerful being in the universe believable. It will make tons of money but could have been so much better.",positive
If you are a 7 years old kid or you have a 7 years old mind you will love this movie ...,negative
"This is an amazing film, which I did really enjoy, and I don't think that story wise it could have been improved. But have to admit that I did prefer Infinity War. I suspect that it managed to maintain such a high octane pace throughout, this one understandably needed a slower pace for the exposition. Also there was just a bit too much humour - the consequences of the previous film are clearly devistating for those left, so the switch to more light hearted banter did not always sir so well with me. Still a must see film and a remarkable example of the true cinematic talent of Russos.",positive
"The part 2 to avengers 3 and what should've been avengers 3 as well really impressed mealthough i didn't enjoy it as much as the first part, i do really think that it was still a good movie.The problem is that i have to have motivation to watch it and that's because it's 3 hours longi'm just saying if they tacked it along side avengers infinity war and sold that in stores, that would be the golden ticket move.",positive
"Dear, dear directors,Please stay away from time travel in your movies. It is guaranteed that the consistency of your story line is fraud. Always.Don't get me wrong: I liked this movie. I really did. But one can't help thinking all kind of scenarios as to: what if?Avengers Endgame seriously defers from all different time movies. An older Nebula kills a younger version of herself. There's a reason why all other time movies ever made consider this impossible... because of some logic in timelines.OK, so in Endgame the theory is that time lines are not connected. You can go back in time, mess the timeline up as far as killing your younger self and still return to your own future like nothing happened. I think it's a kinda lame way to look at time travel, but OK, theoretically possible.But then explain this to me: in the end, Captain America travels back to put all the infinity stones back in their timelines. He does not return using the time machine, but still ends up in the actual timeline as an old man. I'm sorry, but that is inconsistent.Another inconsistency, unavoidable by all time travel movies... how far back do you actually have to travel to meet your own self? It's pretty common to travel back years and find a younger version of yourself. But what if you travel back just one second... will there be two versions of you for the rest of your time line?Time travel is just messy. I don't even want to start about all the time lines that get messed up by Endgame: no Age of Ultron, no Vision, no Scarlet Witch, etc.The last comment I have on this movie is the inconsistency of the power that these superheroes have. In Infinity War, Thor beats up Thanos even when Thanos has all the infinity stones. Iron Man fights Thanos better on Titan than in Endgame on earth. Seriously, without any infinity stones Thanos beats Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and later Captain Marvel who basically flies through armored ships... but can't flight straight through Thanos.I might be over analyzing, I know.Last mayor inconsistency: Thanos is able to get hundreds of people from 2012 to present day using the time machine. The Avengers don't even consider this option... they need to get all infinity stones first to undo the snap. Might it be an idea to bring back about 10-20 key people first and THEN go after the stones?Oh, and nobody got the idea at the end of the movie to ask Captain America, who was going back anyways to put the stones back in their timelines, to bring a version of Natasha, Tony and Vision back with him? I mean... this worked for Gamorra.... she is the version of another timeline...Conclusion: time travel messes up story lines BIG time. Please stay away from them. Find other means to turn things around...Thanks for reading.",positive
"I loved Infinity Wars, it being a totally awesome comic book film that did a great job of having dream team ups and great action and fights. Thanos was an awesome villain that looked unstoppable at times and seeing him snap and reduce half the population to ash was epic. One thing I have to say about this film is that I have never enjoyed a film so much while at the same time being disappointed with it. Was it epic? Yes, but it did not feel as epic as Infinity Wars. Did the main cast do a good job? Yes, but I felt the direction the story went was not all that good. It just seemed very off to me personally. I was not expecting them to rush off to where Thanos was and kill him with ease and then get the five years later line. I just did not care for that at all. They made too much time pass in between the snap and the reformation of the team and a new plan. There are other things that bothered me, but I did enjoy the action and the humor and other aspects of this film...it just was not as good as Infinity War.The story starts out showing us that Hawkeye lost his entire family to the snap which seems a bit against the odds as it were. Then we shift to Tony Stark in space afloat and seemingly near death with Nebula when Captain Marvel comes to the rescue and the gang manage to track Thanos down and kill him after learning he disposed of the stones. Five years later, Ant-man resurfaces from the Quantum realm and somehow manages to come up with a going back in time plot that seems out of his area of expertise. Well, soon the Avengers are back together and planning to get the infinity stones so they can snap everyone back into existence; unfortunately, the Thanos of the past comes to learn of this plan and makes a plan of his own to get the stones the heroes collect.The film was good, but it had problems, as I felt the film was just jamming characters in the film to make as many characters appear as possible. In Infinity Wars it felt more seamless and natural how things fell, this one it felt forced. We have not even seen Pepper in Rescue before in the films, but she shows up here. I was on the fence about Captain Marvel before, when I saw her in her own film, but now I am more sure...I don't care for her. I do not get the goofy ass smile she has like she is superior to everyone else. In the comics the likes of Thor, Hulk would annihilate her in a one on one battle, yet it looks to me like they are setting her up to be the number one Marvel hero going forward and it sucks as she is not that huge of a player in the comic world. The whole females teaming together to get her through the enemies was stupid too, mainly because if she just flies the opposite way, there are no enemies and she could have easily gotten the infinity gauntlet out of there! They went with the total wimp Hulk in this one too, kept expecting him to redeem himself against Thanos after the butt kicking he got, but nope, he was a non factor in the final battle. In the comic Hulk is stronger than Thanos physically to the point Thanos has said he would not go toe to toe with the Hulk as it would be an unwinnable endeavor. The good news the main Avengers save the film and make you enjoy it more than you would if it had Captain Marvel leading the charge. The originals keep you watching despite the flaws in certain areas of the film.So, I enjoyed this one a lot, and I do like it better than Age of Ultron; however, it is not as good as the first film or Infinity Wars. The original cast is good and keeps you watching even though you know that some of them are not going to make it through the film. Unfortunately, if the future is Brie Larson as Captain Marvel then phase four of the Marvel plan is not looking so bright in my eyes. Not sure if it is too late to recast her or not, but she has no charisma. I will still watch sequels such as Spider-man, Guardians, Black Panther and Dr. Strange, but some of the movies they have planned for the future have me scratching my head. I always thought the Marvel Universe had more heroes than that of DC, but they seem to really be running out and relegating several big name heroes to series rather than big screen. Still, this one ends the infinity saga and not sure what they could ever do to top it and the infinity gauntlet anyways.",positive

"Tony said that he would return to his family and accompany them, but he finally chose to return to the Jianghu because of his responsibility and mission, because ""I am the iron man"". The United States team once missed the date with Carter, missed the 70 years of company with Carter, and later attended Carter's funeral, personally sent his beloved on the road, thank the director for giving him a perfect ending. Black widow noble, heroic, heroic, fearless, and iron man tied for the greatest avenger. Raytheon and his mother said good-bye, Tony and his father shook hands and made people cry. The United States made up for the biggest regret in her life; Banna and Hok reconciled; eagle eye reunited with her family; the black widow had no family, because the avenger was her family The ending was perfect and tearful. The scene of the collective return of the grey heroes in Fu Lian 3 is majestic and impressive, with the scale at least five times higher than that in Fu Lian 3. Especially the appearance of the women's Federation is so amazing that it perfectly interprets women's power. Eleven years layout, 22 films, in ""Fu Lian 4"" draw a satisfactory end. To borrow Morgan Stark's words: Marvel I love you three thousand times!",positive
"The Captain Marvel Movie trailer made it seem as though that character would be essential to the defeat of Thanos and the reversal of his victory in Infinity War. I felt a chill of excitement when Captain Marvel first came on the scene, and expected that she would return at a moment when defeat seemed inevitable to finally turn the tide. I was disappointed that Captain Marvel was completely unnecessary for the final victory. If she had been left out of the movie it would have made no difference. She just showed up and fought with them in the final battle being unable to do much better than any of the others. Theses movies all are driven by deus ex maxima, but I expected that to come from Captain Marvel. t didn't. The Movie was pretty good but paced a little poorly. I enjoyed Infinity wars more.",positive
Best movie ever. Nonstop since the first second. I just watched it 2 hours ago and I'm still shaken and wired up about it. Definitely going to watch it again.,positive

"AE is the Final battle of Infinity Saga which concluded the story of every movie since 2008. The time travel explanation was good.It felt like Inception. The ending was the most fulfilling for Iron Man and Captain America. This movie couldn't have been better. The only problem with this movie was with the dubbed version in Hindi, they made the crap out of it, it was the worst dubbing ever. Please Marvel India take this into consideration. Love you 3000",positive
"This movie is exciting,enjoyable and entertaining to watch. It have a lot of memorable moments, epic battles, good story, characters and good Cgi. For example one of its most epic moments was when captain america lift Thor's hammer and the final battle is very epic, the story also is nice, iron man's and black widow's sacrificed their lives to defeat Thanos, and also the Russo brothers and Kevin Feige made a great job in this movie, definitely I recommend this movie and also when I discovered that the avengers will return I hope that the return it will be epic, for now whe had until 2025 for the return of the avengers.",positive

"Avengers: Endgame is an incredible, riveting, highly entertaining and very emotional film, and a brilliant end to the Marvel's Infinity Saga. My first time viewing left me speechless and pleasantly surprised, and I had high expectations. Just like Infinity War before it, it is a masterful film that managed to meet the massive expectations of fans, delivering perfectly on story and character development in a ways I couldn't even expect.While some may think it has a slow beginning, you've come to care so much about the characters and story that it's still investing. The story is intriguing and filled with countless twists and turns that keep you hooked. Seeing each of the characters continue and close their story arcs is very satisfying and poignant, especially how they concluded the stories of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers; you could not ask for a better ending for these characters then what this movie delivers. While some seemed to have a problem with Smart Hulk, I really quite liked him and it was a satisfying conclusion to the conflict between Banner and Hulk. And what they did with Thor is a testament to how much the Russos cared more about characters then eye candy or fanservice; it is completely understandable, realistic, and human to see him devastated after everything terrible that has happened to him, crushed by his own failure, and its great when he begins to believe in himself again. The film balances its emotional scenes perfectly with its comic relief as to make a film that feels appropriately heartfelt and somber while also not forgetting to let its audience have a little fun. The huge final battle is an absolute feast for the eyes and never fails to get me giddy. It has to be one of the most astounding battles ever on film. There exist no lapses in the visual effects, the music is perfect, and acting is excellent, the entire cast gives top-tier performances.An excellent film and a perfect follow-up to Infinity War and ending to the Infinity Saga.",positive
"I'll be dropping SPOILERS here out of frustration. This movie is PURE FANSERVICE.First of all, I will confess I'm not a Marvel fan, but I do love the 20 plus movies that conform this MCU. I started watching them because I am RDJ fan, and I really loved the first Ironman movie (and a liked the second one a lot, not liked the 3rd) and I did see all the movies.I grew up seing them all this ten years, from teenaged girl to adult woman, and I did have great expectations for this movie. It is NOT the event of the year, and it is not the end of an era, is just a movie with no sense. Let me explain... it not work as a solo movie, and have HUGE plotholes.Second of all, I loved Endgame in the technical part Visually is stunning. Action sequences are clean and awesome, and very fluid. Some comic scenes were simply cool, and really made laugh, for instance Scott and the first attempt to make a time travel.This movie is like AIW in the way that it wouln'd work as a solo movie, at all. And I did liked AIW a lot, it was far better than Endgame.It's three hours film, that could easily would be a two hours film, there are scenes thatshould not be in the movie and are there jus for Fanservice.SPOILERS AHEAD:And now, here is my frustration: The Plot.It revolves about time travel to undo what Thanos did. The idea is to go back, take the stones, make a new gauntlet and make back all the half universe Thanos erased. But here is the issue: the mere fact that they did take a stone in past, they are CHANGING EVENT and preventing from happening. Taking a stone would make Thanos not to have it, and therefor the events of AIW would not happen.During some scenes the characters mention time travel movies discrediting them, and disgracing science fiction (not to mention this is fantasy and fiction film, but still it have to have some science, that the characters DO mention a lot). But they should take as a base and foundation all that is written, like Stephen Hawkings work, Einstein... too much? Well, take Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, etc.Time is no joke, and that is what The Russo did here. They laugh at us, giving a nonsense plot.Another issue that annoyed me: Peter Parker comes bakc to his school and all of his friends are there the same age as 5 years ago, so... I will call them Peter Pan and the Lost Boys here. Yeah, you can argue that all of them are gone with the snap... all the college? No... they didin't.Steve Rogers decision to stay in the past CHANGED ALL EVENTS and the first avenger movie didn't happened, and not to mention it is suggested that he married Peggy. That would lead to erase people from existenc: Peggy married in the prime timeline (just for calling it some way) and had children, and they had children. Steve himself make out with her granddaughter, who is now erased from existence: is he a murderer? I friend told me she like to prefer to think he just dance with her and left her to make a life. That also would erase people from existence.And last: Steve appears in this prime timeline as an old man, but this timeline should have chamged and nothig we just see all this three hours had happened.The only thing I have some sorry is for Romanoff death. It wasn't a ""the thing you love most"" sacrifice like Thanos sacrificed Gamora, but she did a selfless action, just to give his friend whom she loves like a brother, a chance to have his family back.As for all people criticizing Fat Thor, well I consider that fan, but unnecessary. Let's say that that gave Loki all the reason: Thor is only a king because is Odin's son, and not because is worthy. He cannot lead his people, and he don't want to, is very clearly seen. Is a cool dude, and a fan guy, and he have all Odin'd hipocresy.END OF SPOILERS.So, for me is a 7/10.I would recommend just to see how the saga ends, and no more.
You have to watch to make a critic, watch at your own risk.",positive
This movies is the greatest superhero movie to ever be created. Robert Downey jr. portray Iron man I couldn't see anyone else playing as iron man.

I would suggest to watching this movie there a great story and excellent finishing,positive
In my opinion this was a huge dissappointment for me. The movie lacks of action and full of irrational content. Its very slow and boring. First half was unnecessary and second half is below par. Im so sad that nearly nothing significant happened in whole 180 minutes. I was expecting the same vibe as infinity war or dark knight but this was more like age of ultron.,positive

P.S. This Final Avengers Film Goes Out To The Great Late Stan Lee And For All Of His Cameo Appreances in Every Marvel Superhero Movie That He Started in.",negative
"Lowered rating from 8 to 7 after rewatching the movie. The plot kind of folds on itself at the end. Iron Man/Tony Stark wipes out 2014 Thanos.Now this gets a bit confusing. Infinity War happens during 2018 giving Avengers the reason to do what they do in Endgame. During this timeline Thanos lives until Thor goes for the head after Thanos destroyed the stones forcing the Avengers to time travel. All goes fine until future Nebula gets caught by 2014 Thanos who then ""dies"" in the future. In other words Thanos dies on the timeline where Infinity war happened before infinity war happened but didn't happen because he disappeared in 2014. But how? Nothing should have happened when Iron Man snapped his fingers. Why? Because snapping 2014 Thanos out of existence makes snapping 2014 Thanos out of existence impossible.This the third snap was impossible to happen. And I mean really impossible. Not the fake impossible that scientists use to discribe things they don't understand.",positive

"After staying up to watch the premiere of the avengers: the end game, the tears and laughs flew together, and the drama was handled super well. Every hero has his own shining points and impressive stunts. Although there are some bugs in the plot, but for the sake of eleven years' feelings and the final curtain call of the original avengers six, all the five-star praise! Some people live, some people die, some people are old, some people live in the past, there are humanized gray, some people died twice, some life and death unknown, some reunion, some curtain call, some people handover, some people are pleased!
Seeing iron man and nebula stranded together in outer space for five years is a tear-filled experience. Seeing captain marvel carry iron man's spaceship back to earth, captain America and iron man meet again after the civil war, he could not help tears in his eyes. Tears of joy as the avengers travel back in time to see Loki reappear; To see the black widow and hawkeye in order to obtain the soul gem to sacrifice their own, to save each other's friendship, tears; See the widow sister sacrifice themselves, eagle eyes to obtain soul gem, tears wet eyes; ""I'm iron man"" becomes the biggest tear in a movie about the man who put on infinite gloves to turn the world around and sacrificed himself to save the world. To see captain America return to the past to escort the original place of the original stone chose to stay in the past to make up for the rescue of the unfinished love, back to the present, old age, tears in the corner of his eyes! I believe that the tin can and the widow sister will not be sacrificed like this, they are just in another parallel time still busy in the laborious mission of saving the world!
Ant-man, hulk, thor, and starlord are the punchline! Shield iron masochistic sweet, eagle few masochistic sweet, hammer base did not meet again, ant and wasp female husband and wife file tacit understanding is very!

"Was a great end to the Avengers Series. There was laughter, humour, action, comedy, along with emotions. This had it all. Not sure what the buzz about Captain Marvel was but was quiet irrelevant to this story in my opinion. Hulk, Thor stole the show for me. Iron Man and Cap great as always. The 3 hours flew past. I give it a 9/10 just because of Captain Marvel spoiling it.",positive

"This film is Phenomenal, it is such a perfect ending to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the amount of fan service and callbacks to previous MCU movies makes it such an entertaining film, I watched all three hours of it and not a second was wasted, even the credits gave me chills where they show all the characters/actors that have made the MCU so memorable and great. I couldn't stop smiling from the moment everyone you have watched for the past ten years come through the portal to the moment Tony Stark snapped his fingers, it was so exciting. Although I am glad the MCU is continuing (even though it's a bit much with all of the series and specials) but this would have been a fine film to end the franchise with. 10 out of 10.",positive
Never thought that a superhero movie could make me as emotional as this one did. RDJ's turn as IronMan was brilliant. To see the character develop from the first IronMan movie to this iteration was a journey well worth taking. And to have the story wrap up with all the characters and plot lines coming together was mind-blowing. A modern classic that sucks you in from the word go.,positive
"I'm going to try and keep this short and to the point as I have a tendency to get carried away when I'm excited........no Spoiler's here.To sum 'End Game' up in one word, I will say - EPIC!
And I really mean epic in every sense of the word.
This. Film. Is. EPIC!!!
The Russo brothers have succeeded in delivering an ending that feels deserved.
It seriously pays off. There are so many references and call-backs to the films that have now spand 10+ years that show these two film maker's are trully passionate about these character's and telling their stories in the most satisfying ways.
Trying not to sound cliche here - the film really IS a love letter to the fans.
End Game is an epic (I know I've said ""epic"" a lot), engrossing, superhero extravaganza that will go down in film history as a masterpiece!
I can confidently say that this is the best superhero film ever made!
Not sure if Marvel can or will ever reach these heights again but one thing is certain - I will still be around for the ride ;)",positive
"Best superhero movie ever made, i laugh, i cried, it gave me goosebumps, just an outstanding movie, pure art by Russo Brothers, great ending for a great series, just want to thanks Marvel, Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo for this amazing 11 years, Avengers is not just a movie for us, its an emotion, i grew up watching this. Endgame worth every penny ,every seconds , just bring tissue paper ,you will definitely cry. LOVE YOU 3000 TIMES!!!",positive
"I have never wrote a review about any movie I watch. I just feel that I have to document what just touched my heart. Growing up in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia, without cinema was hard for me. I remember I used to wait months after the movie comes out to watch it online. When I was in college, I used to travel to Bahrain to watch Marvel movies. I enjoyed watching all the movies. I have developed a strong connection with all the characters. I feel what they feel, I understand what they understand. It became a part of my life. My friends, even my close friends, used to make fun of me for watching superheroes movies. They always say that there is no story it is all CGI, what are you watching it for? They do not understand the creativity of developing characters and flashbacks, let alone understanding a complex plot with many planets and universes. I am so happy that I made it to the U.S and watched the movie in the opening day. With that said, Avengers: Endgame is one of the most epic movies I have ever seen. I laughed too loud, cried too hard, and smiled a lot. I will not write any spoilers, I am not that guy, but I wanted to share some of the feelings that I experienced in these epic three hours. The movie has everything perfect the writing, acting, and directing are all outstanding. If there is one wish that I could have in life is that watching this movie with someone I love who have the same admiration for Marvel movies. To the creators, actors and actresses, people behind the scene, and everyone participated in creating it I cannot thank you enough for what you have done. I know this is not a perfect review but I had to share it somehow.",positive
"Marvel has been up and down for me over the last decade. The superhero genre is definitely wearing thin and then comes this juggernaut of film which is breaking all records and likely to become the biggest film in history. The ratings and reviews have been all around great but I still had reasonable expectations. For the most part, Avengers Endgame fulfilled every expectation I had for it. It has a massive runtime and doesn't actually feel slow at all. The three hours goes by easily and the film builds expertly on it's previous films. There has never been an ensemble cast like these movies and this film specifically. There was a significant character development change with Hulk/Bruce Banner and also Thor and I'm not sure I liked either one. Hulk wasn't really Hulk but then it also made a lot of room for new development. Thor's change was sort of unnecessary and fans of Thor would be quite annoyed at his change I would think. Captain America and Iron Man though are as solid as they've ever been. Robert Downey Jr gives one of his best performances as Iron Man that he's ever given (no it's not Oscar worthy - sorry fans!) . The first 2 + hours of the film are not action packed. It takes it's time building the story and visiting previous points in time throughout the Avengers history and then comes the final battle. Now the final battle of this film is the definition of blockbuster. It is massive in scale and incredible to watch and edge of your seat, popcorn thrills. You can't help but want to cheer when the entire Marvel Universe shows up and Captain America utters ""Avengers Assemble"" (for the first time) before one of the largest battles I've ever seen. The last 30-45 mins of the film is a solid 10 in spectacle. Avengers Endgame is fulfilling a lot of expectations and for me it was a good time at the movies and a worthy end to this particular leg of one of the most successful franchises in film history. 8.5/10",positive
"Don't get me wrong I love the marvel films and was excited to see this but I have to say I left a bit disappointed. Most probably because I'm a hulk fan and I personally think they ruined his character arc, didn't we all want to see a crazy angry Hulk rematch with Thanos? Instead we got a dabbing Shrek with glasses!
The whole MCU movies were really all about Cap and TS, and their stories were great I just think the writers got to the point where they didn't know where to go with the rest of the team, bit of a shame really.I quite like Captain Marvel but felt her character should have been introduced in phase 4 as she wasn't in the movie much. Saying all that the actual film was super slick, visually amazing and the hours flew by. Be very interesting to see where MCU go from here.Ps. A depressed Demi God! Come on now!",positive
"This is a movie best enjoyed on the Big screen, with a large audience. We can nitpick and overanalyze small plot details, but overall, Marvel Studios has delivered a great experience. To tie all these movies together, as best they could, is no small achievement. As more people continue to stay home and stream content, this movie is a reminder of the true power of cinema.",positive
"Unpopular opinion. there are too many plot holes, not an epic movie opposed to what fanboys think. Entertaining but slow paced.I watched IW thrice but wouldn't like to see endgame again.",positive
"The last Avengers ended with a philosophically valid dilemma. Stop the overpopulation of all worlds by halving the population in the universe in order to save humans and other species. The only mention of environment in Endgame was Captain America stating ""a pod of whales was seen in the Hudson, if you want to look at the bright side"" to which Black Widow replies ""I will throw this sandwich at you"". Yup, that's as deep as that conversation went. Immediately they were back to the tired old 'save humanity from evil Thanos' plot. The world is portrayed as a complete shambles with Thanos' reduced population measures. It would have been far more interesting to show the positive changes of having fewer people in the richness of the planet, thriving of other species as well as our own. But no, that is completely ignored and the ecosystem crushing population returns. Very generic plot, disappointing.",negative
"The best of the best, when you think of how a superhero movie needs to be done think of Avengers: Endgame. The epic blockbuster that gave fans all the payoff they deserved after 22 movies and 10 years Robert Downey Jr does a stand out job as his final performance as Iron Man he puts so much heart into his character in this movie, the intensity and well pacing makes this movie super watchable it doesn't feel like three hours and that is a good thing. Marvel knew what they were doing when they made this masterpiece.",positive
"So much to see here, lots going on. First movie in years where I did not allow myself a 5 minute potty break. amazing and original and impactful. the best!",positive
"How is it even possible that someone that watch marvel movies watches this film and does not like it?
Honestly I think that some of these reviews are from competitors.
The movie is really a masterpiece.
3 hours of a great work.
10/10 is the least I can give!",positive
"After seeing all the 22 movies and some of them even twice I have to say that the last movie of the MCU was perfectly balanced in every aspect. Full of passion, drama, funny scenes, action... it has it all! An almost flawless scenario that left me stumbled by its depth and ode in logike.
This scenario along with the coordination of the Russo Brothers (another proof that brotherhood collaboration excels) truly inspired all actors involved for a great performance. All these years of participations in different movies also enable them all to surpass themselves in acting. That's the success on the MCU in my opinion along with a clearly anthropocentric approach to the character of its heroes .Of course with such an amount of actors playing there will have been some cliques projected more during the film, but their unification under one roof was excellent. Thumbs up also for actor's discretion on leaks on the script.To be honest after I watched with much anticipation Avengers Infinity War in which I have to say I expected more in terms of fights among characters like in the comic books (maybe I was biased due to the numerous action-based trailers), I was prepared for a good but not special endgame.
But on the contrary as Red Skull would say
""We all think we were prepared.. we were all wrong!""A mind elevation for children, a new dimension of sentimental fulfillment for adults..
Best entertaining three hours I had in years! I just wish we had even some more!
Especially in the movie's action scenes, I had such goosebumps only from classic trilogy like Wachowski Bros Matrix or in the Star Wars clone war.Must SEE 10/10.",positive
"The hype held up, if you are a marvel fan you will love this end to the cinematic universe.",positive
"Going through the past scenes is a great review of Marvel's 11 years of film history. Both feelings and laughter can fully enjoy every detail or forgotten. When the lost comrades gathered up the All-Star team again, all the foreshadowing broke out with emotion at this moment. In those days, the six member team now has thousands of troops, and it is a miracle to go to this stage. Two pillars and two curtain calls mark the end of an era",positive
"It doesn't feel long Every scene is very well thought but I expected a more serious and darker tone after what happened in ending of the previous movie. 1/3 of the movie is spent on giving new layers to characters, but after Ant-Man appears it becomes a silly movie targeted to teens. The solemn tone of the movie disappears without a proper transition. After that everything is messy and convoluted. It's not bad and they had a lot to include but they could avoid the journey through the past movies and use the time on depeloping and giving a proper conlcution to a 10 year saga.",positive
"After 11 years and with 22 films being released in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Endgame reaches a satisfying and emotionally gut-wrenching conclusion that delivers a larger spectrum of heartbreaking, superb, and thrilling stakes and twists, combined with every powerful performances within the entire ensemble cast, a wide-ranging display of emotions and depth, a masterstroke screenplay, storytelling and direction, a suspenseful and thrilling musical score, and a coherent and nuanced visual effects, sound design, pacing and editing. Avengers Endgame ultimately serves as the shining pinnacle and an outstanding finale tribute to the Infinity Saga within the Marvel Cinematic Universe that all started with 2008's Iron Man.While Black Panther remains as the unique, phenomenal, and inspirational masterpiece of the MCU and a cultural significance; Avengers: Endgame is something more of just being a masterpiece but a phenomenal legacy and a magnum opus, not just within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but throughout the entire cinema, of all which it ties with other classical cinematic masterpieces with great endings such as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2.Without any doubt, Avengers: Endgame truly serves as the greatest superhero movie alongside Black Panther, Logan, and The Dark Knight, as well as the greatest movie that will forever defined pop culture and modern cinema in years and decades to come.",positive
"To say that I was excited for this movie is a huge understatement, and I think that counts for millions of people. But coming into the movie I definitly had my worries, and to be honest the first hour and a half I liked the movie just enough to give it a 6, but WOW I definitly wasn't expecting this... Endgame is the kind of movie were two things can happen. One, they just throw action on the screen, give you some one liners and send you home without feeling anything. Or two, they love and respect the source material, the previous movies, the audience and Stan Lee so much, that they try to give you everything they can and more.Don't get me wrong the first act I loved, real somber tone that carried through from Infinty War. But the beginning of that second act I don't. When they introduce Banner and Thor 5 years later that really didn't work for me, also the Fortnite refrence I hated. I didn't really find anything funny and I just wanted them to go to the interesting part. But when they time travel to the previous movies and I saw Captain America fighting himself, I was completely sold from that point on. The ark that Tony has gone through in these movies is magnifecent. Steve also has a great ark and for me the soul of these movies always layed with these two characters.But now, let's talk about that third act... agian, WOW! We already lost Black Widow wich I wasn't expecting at all! Then the 2014 Thanos comes to Earth to once and for all destroy the whole universe. When Steve grabbed Thor's hammer, I thought I lost it at that point. And when Captain America stood infront that entire army on his own, I really thought he was gonna do everything he could to stop that army. But when all the other Avengers came through the portals I could cry at that very moment. And when he finally says 'Avengers... Assemble' I wanted to cheer. Hats of to the Russo brothers because they made a fight scene that is on the level of The Lord of the Rings, that's how good this fight is!When Thanos has all the Infinty Stones and Tony realizes they are gonna lose and he looks over to Doctor Strange, and he says 'one' at that time Tony knew what he needed to do. When Tony snaps his fingers after stealing the Infinity Stones and all the badguy's turn into dust, and we see Tony dying from that one snap and everybody surrounds him, and Pepper says 'It's alright Tony, you can rest now.' He finally looks at peace because after all these years he finally did what he always wanted, for everybody to be save. That was a beautiful sendoff to this legend we call Iron Man.Now that's not the end, and I thought they were gonna end the movie with Steve and they did. When he doesn't come back in those five seconds, and he sitts there this old man that looks complete and happy and Sam asks him 'You wan't to tell me about her?' And he says 'No, no I don't think I will.' And the song It's been a Long, Long Time starts playing, and you see him finally getting the dance he wanted with Peggy, I knew that this was being made by people who really cared and loved these movies. And that's all I ever wanted...I can talk about the things that bugged me, and the plotholes in the movie but the fact of the matter is, that I have waited 11 years for this movie, and sometimes I wan't to enjoy it and feel emotionally connected to these characters. So if you ask me 'Can you tell me all the things that bugged you?' All I have to say is 'No, no I don't think I will.'",positive
"Well, was hyped to the max for this movie but in the end, Avengers Endgame was as bad as its name and was the worst Avengers movie. Story was disconnected and dialogues were cliche. Thanos and Avengers doing hand to hand combat was beyond ridiculous.Utmost focus on Cap and Iron Man. Unimaginable nerfing of Thanos, Thor and Hulk. Time travel was handled extremely badly. Humor was overused and movie felt like Gotg-3. Power of Avengers and Thanos was not visualized properly and battle/fight scenes felt bland. I need to re-watch Infinity War to forget this abomination.",negative

"I like this movie too much. so delicate, so perfect, I cried several times, I have to watch it a few more times.",positive
"This is one of the most ambitious movies ever put to screen and boy does the ambition pay-off. I can see this movie pleasing both hardcore MCU fans and causal viewers however you at least need to see Infinity war before watching Endgame. The acting, visual effects and overall story were great and will have probably set the bar for all superhero films to come. The only place I could see problems with the film were with the tone and pacing but they were just minor issues that are more than likely to happen with a 3 hour film. This movie is definitely worth the watch and is sure to be an instant classic.",positive
"My wife and I have been huge fans of all the Marvel moives and watch opening weekends! I almost couldn't sleep waiting for this movie with all the build up for it, with how crazy IW was I couldn't think how this would turn out. How much I don't want to agree with alot of the comments the first 2 hours are really slow. Why are we building up charactors again when there have been 20+ movies??? The deaths that happened to Black Widow and Iron Man were suprising. I was very happy that they finally showed how powerful the Scarlet Witch is but that was short lived too. You bring Captian Marvel in and she only has 15 minutes of screen time at best??? I love how tough it was for them to kill Thanos with no gaulet at the end fight but, in the start they kill him right away.This movie is good don't get me wrong but, if you asked me to watch this one or IW there isn't even a debate there. These movies should have been combined or creat a third movie if you need it. It's like all the story and energy went into IW and not this one. There are some awesome moments like when Cap uses the hammer and gets the final family life he wanted but, that took forever, what about agent 13 that just goes to the way side?Not the best MCU movie but, still enjoyable!I would love to rate 10/10 but that would be a lie, might even be a 7/10.",positive
"The movie was disappointing from many perspectives, but I want to stay in one that I cannot ignore. It was a three hour movie with a ten minute fights, unlike all other Avengers movies. Moreover, the fight scene was an obscure night fight, also unlike all other Avengers, which was very frustrated, because in night fights you cannot see any details. I can see that the writers wanted an alternative movie, based even on the comic, but you can do it in the fun Avengers way. We were waiting and we were waiting for a fight until the final scene. Overall, it was a movie of too much talking and unnecessary scenes, like the support group scene with Chris Evans. I don't see how Marvel Universe will recover after so many great actor removals. I do hope so though.",positive
This movie had everything i need in it and things i didnt. It closed off so many stories and gave closure to a lot of characters. It made me laugh it made me cry. It was funny and deep. Yes it was very dialogue heavy to start with but you needed that to set up how everyone was dealing with the fall out of Infinite Wars. Was the time travel a bit messy sure but no movie will ever get that right but what they did in this made sense. For all the fan boys complaining about oooo Thor and Hulk were misused no they weren't. Thor being one of the strongest characters in the MCU wasn't hahandling depression very well and for those who have suffered from it know how he feels. As for the hulk Bruce had finally worked out a balance in his life and was never keen on fighting so him not being heavily involved made sense. This is the first time I've been in a movie and the who crowd reacted at once in sheer joy at Captain America weilding the hammer. The moments made in this movie will stand out for a long time and tge Russo brothers should be applauded for making the ending to the saga we reset not the ones fan boys wanted.,positive

"I'm a big fan of Marvel movies. I watched it twice in the cinema. The details of the movie are very good, which reminded me of the previous Marvel movies.",positive
"Probably good enough. I'd say not any better or worse than infinity war.
A few things:1) Why was Thor the absolute worst version of himself? They completely ruined him the whole movie.2) How did Captain America gain the ability to use Thor's hammer?3) The Hulk - also the worst version of himself.Messy end fight scene, Captain Marvel was a total novelty, Thanos made several fair points.How is Thanos stronger than a spaceship idk.The 'Girl Power' scene made me audibly groan in the cinema. Unnecessary.",positive
"This movie was disappointing! It didn't make sense to kill off Thanos in the first 10 min of the movie.The whole timeline opens up to many plot holes.You can tell Captain a marvel was an afterthought. They literally had he on the movie for 15 min runtime!This movie could have been saved if:1. No Time Travel
2. More Captain Marvel
3. Less Grieving scenes, (We get it)
4. More Actjon!!!",negative

"It didn't.Don't get me wrong this is one of the greatest movie-series finales of all time, it did everything in its power to earn what it brought to the table and concluded the story of the Avengers beautifully, but there's one very major thing that keeps me from giving it a 10/10 rating, that in question is the death of Black Widow.Anybody I would bring this up to would tell me ""that was the only way to get the soul stone,"" ""sacrifices needed to be made,"" or ""it wouldn't have had as great of an impact if anyone else did it."" But after a while of complaining and wishing that it was handled differently I eventually did some research and have now come to a new conclusion about this whole thing.Let's start off with why the filmmakers decided to kill her off, it turns out the film's visual-effects editor said ""Black Widow shouldn't be robbed of this moment,"" while I understand where they were coming from in that sense and agree it left a large impact on the audience, it doesn't work within the context of the story. We live in a day and age where subverting people's expectations isn't always going to win them over, predictability isn't always a bad thing as long as it works for the context of your story.Now to go into why it should've been ""Hawkeye"" who gets sacrificed for the stone. If you don't recall, Hawkeye's family gets wiped out by Thanos when the snap first occurred, that resulted in him losing his sanity and going on a killing spree. It's at this point we get to see Hawkeye become more interesting than he's ever been throughout the series, he deserves proper closure for how his arc in the film goes, but instead he spends the whole rest of the movie not facing any consequences for his actions, then goes back to his status-quo characterization once the snap has been reversed, and we're going to act like his psychotic escapades don't matter or that it even happened at all. The scene at Vormir could've justified his actions and we wouldn't be left with the fact that one of the best characters in this franchise had to be absent from the final battle at the end that we were all waiting for, and sure Black Widow may have had a dark past but she still had things in her life she needed to live for.I'm not saying I hate or dislike the movie because of them excluding Black Widow from the rest of the last half and not handling Hawkeye properly from that point and onward. It's a true cinematic masterpiece that delivered what it promised spectacularly, there's no other way they could've pulled it off. I just feel that they shouldn't have to have felt so obligated to get a reaction out of the audience by the time we get to the middle act, especially by using a character that we all really love.",positive
The words can never describe how awesome the movie was. I brought my own diaper to last the 3 hour movie.,positive
"Endgame is carried by irresistable emotion and nostalgia, but it doesn't take away the fact that its 3 hour runtime and main story was not justified or fulfilled the way it could've been.Feeling like more of a Captain America film more than anything else. Endgame is a more honed in and character focussed film than Infinity War, but it's just not nearly as exciting. It opens with a phenomenally cinematic prologue that makes you believe you're in for the Avengers ride of your life.
But once the story really gets going, it never really gets going. In fact they spend a tremendous amount of time in mindless despair when they could've just jumped into their time travel premise but sooner and been able to explore things with much greater intensity and context.
When Infinity War seemed like a near perfect ""situation"" type film for Endgame to use in their time travel pursuits, the Russo's completely neglect that film, that timeline and that villain as if it was not meant to be. Sucking out the endearing excitement that Infinity War gave us. And instead give us the Greatest Hits version that works on some levels of emotion, but just didn't quite fulfill the immensity of its intent. To save and bring back all the stones. Which felt more conveniently achieved rather than compellingly explored.
Ultimately they accomplish what they set out to do, with almost no sense of complication or challenge or even steaks at all. It gets to its climax so it can let all of its heroes have it with the great and undisputed Thanos, who isn't even the same Thanos as Infinity War.
And concludes a movies that is clearly meant to be a fan-letter, send-off tale for the MCU. And boy on that regard, does it deliver. But in terms of story, it's a hit and miss.But nevertheless, it's climax is something to behold. And furthermore its final few moments may even endear a stronger impact than one might expect. Making you miss a franchise you never thought you would.But In the end it was big, powerful, and hopelessly long and nostalgic. But it certainly isn't the 3 hour epic finale it poses to be. It's just fine in its own light of excitement.",positive
"What can i say that hasn't been said already? 11 years and 21 films building up to this epic finale... It was spectacular and emotional. The CGI is so good, especially on Thanos, Rocket and 'Professor Hulk', who now just blend in so good that i don't even notice it anymore. The Time Heist was great and full of funny meta jokes and do i even need to say anything about the epic final battle?
We will miss you Heimdall, Loki, Vision, Gamora, Natasha and Tony Stark...
This movie is 3000/10",positive
"I absolutely loved Infinity War. It is without any doubt or second thought, the best Marvel movie and among the best superhero movies ever.
With this said I was super hyped to see where the second part would go history wise, after such epic ending of the first film.
And what they do? They kill Thanos in the first 15 minutes.
I know it served the plot somehow, but the emotional connection with the main villain was completely gone.After this they proceed with a dull series of events portraying depressed heroes and coming up with this ""quantum realm time travel"" thing to give the remaining heroes a chance to turn back time and revive their fallen comrades.Scattered around the world, the solitary, remorseful, depressed, suicidal or obese heroes get together and devise a plan to get the Infinity Stones again.From this point onward until the last roughly 40 minutes the movie turns into a deja vu trip. We get to see a little bit of previous MCU movies, they mess with the past, even giving Loki an escape path. They intertwine realities and dimensions to get the stones and finally Thanos realizes what happens in the future and intervenes.But this is not the real Thanos. It's a mere copycat to whom we didn't develop emotional attachment to. We didn't see him going through character development, like our heroes did. The only difference between this and the real old Thanos is that this one now aims to destroy the universe and create a new one. So the drive and ambition of the first Thanos which turned him into such a great ambiguous villain is now radicalized and he ends up becoming another regular villain with thirst for power. This completely disconnected me from the novie.The main fight sequences are great, the return of the fallen heroes from the first movie was expected but pretty well done. The all-women moment defending Spiderman was unecessary, Captain America worthy of Thor's hammer was lame as hell and passing the shield to a black guy instead of Bucky felt politicized.I'm kind of glad Cap Marvel ended up having little importance in the whole thing, and the protagonism went all to the old timers. They deserved the protagonism.All in all, I think this movie was almost weaker copy of the first, with the difference of who snaps the finger in the end. Even the humor is 10x worse. They lost a chance to do something unforgettable, and ended up with an overly dramatic rehashed sequel.I saw Infinity War four times. This one I won't even see a second.",positive
"I never did side with either DC or Marvel - even as a kid in the 1960's. There were superheroes I liked and ignored the rest. Now, while DC is showing us how poorly a film can be made (particularly ""Justice League""), Marvel has aced 60% of their 22 films to date in my opinion. I wish that was the case with this one. It not only underwhelmed me, it didn't serve it's predecessor well.I certainly don't fault the cast because outside the handful of main characters, the rest were merely background and foreground. After Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow, the rest of the cast were so many that they seemed like they were there for scenery. And like ""Justice League"", ""Avengers: Endgame"" suffered from the ""more is more"" syndrome that may please the under-10 crowd, but takes meaning away for us older viewers.Let's not overlook the cop-out remedy in science fiction these days - the reliance upon time travel to get out of a script jam. I realize it was a necessity in this particular chain of fictional events, but after a while it seems like (pardon the musical reference) a long, drawn-out guitar solo that has you wishing the band would get back to the song.This review isn't due to Thor (my favorite Marvel hero) growing fat and channeling his inner surfer dude, Tony Stark losing his life or Gamora 2.0 being the anti-Gamora. My regret is FOR the franchise instead of me as a viewer. They ended on a sad technical note due to unnecessary goings-on that I'm sure they worked very hard at trying to tie up in a movie.Another point that detracted from this film, and a few others in the Marvel cinematic universe is their social messaging. They didn't need to preach woman power because superheroes already have that built into their character. Here, it's shoved into our faces to signal their fashionable virtuosity. In other words, if there is a female superhero in a film, I don't need to be reminded that there's a sexual revolution going on here in reality. Theirs are formidable personas without need to be underscored.Using another musical analogy, this movie was like the members of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and The Who taking the stage at the same time and playing their sets. Apart, they're the best. Together, they're just noise. ""Avengers: Endgame"" would have been better if they pared down the scope, although I understand why they went the way they did. A franchise as successful as MCU set itself up for such a debacle. I'm grateful that it wasn't much, much worse.I thank those at Marvel for bringing to life the characters I read about in comic books at the corner store. They did a very good job overall.",negative
"After watching all the previous movies related to this one, I was excited to see this one. The crazy ending of Infinity War left me moody and waiting for answers.Endgame is funny, sad and major! I laughed so much watching this and shred some tears. If you have seen previous movies you can totally get all the jokes and winks toward us Marvel fans :)Worth to watch at least three times! I seriously can not get over this movie!",positive
"Good performances, good dialogue driven scenes, nicely written emotional scenes, stunning visuals and an incredible third act. Such a wonderful culmination to 11 years of film making.",positive
"The dedication and acting of the cast was incredible! The score was phenomenal! Such a heartbreaker and a tear. Great movie, I do think infinity war was better.",positive
"Of all 21, this one was a tear jerker. I couldn't keep my tears in my eyes. What I call the first part of the movie was a bit slow, but it picked up for sure. I loved the way they brought back familiar characters from previous movies. They did an excellent job bringing back those individuals we thought we'd never see again. The ending fight was just the best, it was awesome, words can't explain. Just see it!!",positive
"Greatest movie of all time. Period. The plot, the execution, everything?",positive
"This is the greatest MCU Film. The film has really good writing and very a smart film. The film that makes it soo good is that the Directors thought of something that everyone would like and that when they put a time machine in the film. It made people get interested
Avengers Endgame = 8.1",positive
"Watched 190426.It's been 10 months since I watched this movie which I was looking fwd to for 1 year. Never before have I expected as much from a movie.And hardly ever have I been so disappointed.. it's not that it's terrible because it isn't. But it was a so-so experience more than a ""wow"" which I unfortunately expected. The last 30 minutes are ok and it has its moments but generally the story just isn't engaging enough.The lack of character development for CM left a bad taste for me right away. If they would have introduced her in a better way it would have made a significant difference to me.The Thor ""issue"" was unnecessary as well. The character has grown in popularity since ""Ragnarok"", why ruin that like this? I know that some people says it makes him more human, I say it makes him a fool..The story is acceptable otherwise and as I said, the last 30 minutes are somewhat epic which ""saves"" the movie for me.But overall just average which is a major disappointment since I expected the most epic movie experience in my life.",positive
"A spectacular conclusion to the first three phases of the MCU. A ton of action and emotion makes this one of the best Superhero movies anyone will ever watch. While it is easy to get sidetracked by the hype around this movie there are plot holes that will make you scratch your head. Personally this movie is one of the best cinematic experiences ever. I laughed, I cried and I clapped.",positive
"For the entire first hour, I was really straining to hear the dialog. I stepped out and asked the theater manager to turn it up and ... maybe they didn't. But my sister (on the other side of the planet) said it was the same thing. Did the producers intentionally make the first hour super-quiet to get us to ""lean in"" and pay closer attention maybe?Audio problems or not, by the end, I was really confused with so many questions ... and didn't feel super-motivated to watch the whole thing again to figure out all the little plot holes that were left untidied. I guess I'll have to wait for the Honest Trailer version to come along and explain everything... :)",positive
"I was avenger fan, but what I saw was really juvenile and even a kid could write better than this one, I could accept the death of 2 main characters but the end was really unacceptable, my mind can't till now ingest it.I will give it 3 stars one for CGI, one for whole team efforts including productions team and actors and finally one for audience who wasted their 3 hours watching this trash...",negative
I've always been a fan of comics either DC or marvel i was fan of both and supported both sides but to be honest The MCU is way better than the DCEU dont get me wrong but DC got a good future as i saw in aquaman and shazam but to see how all these 22 movies of the MCU just connect and reach its peak is just pure gold a great ending to a great era and i just can't wait what the phase 4 is going to bring us,positive
"This movie hit all the notes, was well acted, entertaining, emotional and wrapped everything up nicely. Yea the time travel aspect is hokey but ITS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE PEOPLE! Don't believe the hate, do believe the hype and go see this movie!",positive
"Endgame is a good movie. There is a lot of quality.
But after all the hype and the excellent ""Infinity War"" I probably expected too much.What I liked: The actors did a great job, esp. Robert Downey Junior. The screentime of Captain Marvel was reduced to a tolerable minimum. Our original heroes all get their moments to shine. Humor was hit and miss but mostly it worked. The ""Thor is a slob now"" joke was a bit overused though.
The end battle is pretty epic.What I disliked: There was not enough action and the story drags at times. The Time Travel idea was probably the only way out of the corner the writers had written themselves in after Infinity War and there are also the typical problems/plotholes that come with time travel stories.It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its good conclusion.",positive
"Wildly ambitious and emotionally-charged, Avengers: Endgame (2019) is a near flawless conclusion to one of the greatest cinematic achievements in history. 21 films. Billions of box-office dollars. All culminating in a 3-hour, beyond epic finale that is as exhilarating as it is satisfying. Saying anymore would simply be a disservice to everyone involved in creating a film that delivers a payoff beyond comprehension. Go see it for yourself... and take it all in one last time. Thank you Russo Brothers for delivering an amazing end to this truly wonderful journey. Thank you x3000",positive

"I remember ten years ago when I was a comic book fan and the whispers that were coming out about a Thanos Avengers movie blew my mind. Infinity War satisfied that desire greatly, but Endgame is a mixed bag. I came out of the cinema feeling rather underwhelmed.To be sure, the action is superb. The last half hour of action made me grin from ear to ear and it gave me a similar feeling to watching Return of the King for the first time. However, it was a long road to get to that point.The film is too long. Far too long. It carries far too much baggage from the last movie and drags its heels, which in turn creates a jarring tonal discordance from quipping-Marvel fun to apocalyptic moping. Stop telling me how important things are. I know. Show me why they're important.Another problem I have is the story. It never felt like I was watching one. Infinity War was a hectic race against the clock, Endgame felt like I was watching a board meeting of writers and executives discussing how they're going to tie up loose ends. This is a movie that serves a cinematic universe owned by Disney, rather than serving to tell us a story.Without discussing spoilers, the plot is far too convoluted. The all-powerful Infinity Gems created enough plotholes you have to ignore, but adding time travel to the mix compounds this even further. It would be fine if the movie just dismissed these plotholes, but it keeps harping on the precise mechanics of how the time travel works in the MCU over and over, forcing me to think about how it makes no sense over and over. I don't like thinking about plotholes but Endgame just kept reminding me of them. Combined with the length this makes a large amount of the movie rather a chore to sit through.You must think I hate this movie after that, but I don't. The positives are the ones that come with the standard Marvel movie, funny writing, excellent music, effects, acting and likable characters. I'm certainly glad to have seen it, but unlike Infinity War, it wears out it's welcome after the first viewing.",positive
This movie is beyond the expectation. I think this statement is enough to get an idea without any spoilers that how is the movie.,positive
The Infinity War was 10 times better. The end game is just way to long and boring,positive
"I didn't like end game much. to long. to slow. to sloppy, to weak of a plot. to many cameos.thanos had to much physical power, all the other superheros got their power from outside sources, his was never explained. is it supposed to be his is born that way? even in infinity war he had to much physical strength. of which i didnt like the beginning of showing the end of 'thor, ragnorock, victorious ending being totally useless. a better ending and more tense/suspenseful scene would have been showing them fly off towards thanos ship in waiting.if thanos got his strength from some unnatural method, i missed that being explained. then why no others like him? comics say he is a titan. why no other titans?the key points in the movie's end fight scenes were far to subtle and why did iron man have to die because he used the glove? it was never explained. thanos never suffered using them, only destroying them. and so many others had it, why didn't they use it? even if it would kill them, whether they knew it would kill them or not, they could have ended it all instantly.the time travel thing was oh so sloppy. seems it was used only to go over the list of all the other movies. was more like a reunion documentary than an actual movie. bored the crap out of me. and the stupid mistakes made me upset.so now they have all the stones, with or without a glove, why did they need time travel machines to go back again to replace them? wouldnt the stones have let them do what they wanted to do, restoring any history they wished, one without thanos? and they could have brought back vision, why didnt they? etc etc etc.captain marvel was vastly wasted. so was her haircut. what was the point of that? she said she was needed elsewhere? who cares whats happening in the rest of the universe when its not going to matter after the glove puts it all back right. the only and the smartest thing about the movie was when thanos took her power stone to beat her. that was the best 10 seconds in the movie. but with that stone, they should have been equal. but then not equal because thanos isnt strong enough to smash entire ships by himself like captain marvel is. she is, without a doubt, by far the strongest character and that strength was not used.oh ya, that the glove just had to get back to him was such a joke of a cliche. again, should have been used before. the center point of the movie should have been making use of the glove by other means.thanos and the glove. he is smart enough to build a vast empire, yet he can only think to use the glove to kill. not to created a better method of existence without killing? he not so smart after all. and neither are any of the others for not suggesting something of that sort.the time travel thing should have put it all back right from the point of before thanos snapped fingers. should have gone back to the point where star lord should have shot thanos and ended it all, and then actually shoot him and end it all. of which that star lord didnt shoot him was the stupidest and weakest part of infinity wars. he was going to kill him but got so upset at him that he didnt kill him. huh? how does that work? who else would not have instantly shot thanos upon hearing such news?the only thing this movie was successful for was giving out as many paycheques as possible. the most cameos any movie ever had. did they really need to do that? showing 3 second clips at the end in the credits of each actor would have been better. at least less boring.they didnt just want to end the story line, they wanted to end my interest in it also. i watched them all just to make sure i didnt miss anything that might have been worth while. some of the others were just great. this one was far from it.",negative
Great conclusion to phase 1 - 4 (except spiderman:far from home)Really good for fans of comics as the Easter eggs will make you tingle in places. Mostly a good action filled movie. Good departure for the main avengers,positive
"Can't believe all the bad reviews. This was a great film that will last for decades. It's funny that some reviewers say this would never happen in real life, of course not dummies open your imagination.",positive
"OK so I always struggle with time travel as a plot device. Mostly because I consider it to be lazy in terms of the story writing ... don't like how the ending went? ... we'll go back in time and undo it! It's LAZY.And when I saw Endgame in the theaters I LOVED the beginning and they kill Thanos and I'm thinking ""ok he destroyed the stones ... how are they going to undo this?"" and then they go ""TIME TRAVEL"" and my heart just sank. So the first time through I missed a LOT due to being bummed out. And I walked out of the theater with a disgruntled smirk.However ... the second time, I had a chance to pause and rewind when Dr Hulk explains the time travel rules and, to my surprise, they actually do make sense.
Which made me far less irritated when he explained why they couldn't just go back and kill baby Thanos. And with that part making better sense I was able to pay more attention to the other bits that bothered me the first time and upon second viewing I realized that they actually did a pretty decent job of telling the story and nearly everything lined up.I still have bones to pick ... for instance, it was purely coincidence that Nat and Hawkeye went to Vormir? Cuz if Nebula and Rodi had gone then they would've been screwed. Seriously nobody knew the trick to getting the soul stone but they sent nearly the only pair that could make it work? Just dumb luck? OK ... fine. And I don't understand why the 4 had to land on Morag and then split up ... but ok. And then Captain America going back in time wouldn't have messed up his own timeline but he would've messed with Peggy's. Wouldn't that mean he would end up on a different trajectory? So he wouldn't have ended up on that bench at the end?See this is the problem with time travel.And I was disappointed by some missed opportunities. What I loved about Infinity War was the mash-ups of the different worlds, the characters meeting and collaborating. And with the exception of Nebula there weren't really that many mash-ups. I would've loved more Okoye ... even some Okoye would've been nice. She was relegated to 1 scene and then the end ... bummer. I would've loved a lot more Rocket. I think it would've been better if they'd left Shuri alive and had her contribute to the science since that part of Infinity War was awesome. And more Captain Marvel of course though I know why they did what they did with her ...All of that being said, the final battle is one of the greatest things I've ever watched. I loved it both times and wanted to watch it again immediately after finishing which means I'll likely watch this film several more times.Endgame is a wonderful conclusion to an outstanding film series ... the most epic ever attempted. And while it's not perfect it's still very well done.",positive
"Not as good as Infinity War, but still a very satisfying conclusion to a lengthy, beloved franchise. Lots of great laughs and awesome moments.",positive
"Does this movie have loopholes, of course it does - nothing is perfect but you tend to ignore them and focus on the pure joy and excitement you get from watching this movie. So many emotions and how they connected their very first movie to the last (no spoilers) - it was sheer brilliance.A job very very well done. Didn't disappoint.",positive
Best movie ever I have seen and will suggest it to everyone,positive
"I'm a HUGE Marvel fan and have been so excited for this movie, and to be honest, I'm disappointed. It was a decent movie, and I was invested in the story, but it was no where near my expectations.This movie was way too over hyped and in my opinion, messy. Humor was good, emotion was there (at the end), and concept was cool. But, ruined certain character arcs, was poorly executed, and was not worth the hype I gave it before seeing it.There were moments that made me very emotional, laugh, and made me jump with excitement which is all a plus. I came out of the theater crying a mix of happy and sad tears, but the more I think about it, there were so many flaws (mostly to do with character arcs). It was so fast paced with the characters and ruined the genuine connection we built with them in past movies. It's almost like they're completely different people. All in all, it was an ending we won't forget... even though it kind of flopped.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is everything you've heard and much, much more, this is tied with Infinity War and No way Home the best MCU film.This is a movie that broke me, put me back together, and broke me again in one of the most impactful cinema experiences ever.This is one of the best cinematic experiences I've ever had, the portal scene is my favorite scene in all of superhero movies, and this movie has the saddest ending of all time, it broke every rule and I would not change a thing. This is one of the four movies that has actually made me cry in my life and there are no words for how lucky I feel to have seen this in the theater.The portal scene is movie magic, I will never forget seeing it in the theater, this movie is the best MCU movie right behind Infinity War and every character arc is perfect.The only grade I can give this movie is an A+",positive
"I was ecstatic-- So ecstatic to see this film. But after just watching it. Honestly I don't know what to feel...The first 2+ hours was a snail's pace. I felt there were too much unnecessary dialogues. And being true to heart of watching all the Marvel movies, this one made me yawn at least 3 times.The ""good stuff"" only came towards the last hour. But even then the action sequences wasn't THAT great in comparison to Infinity War. It was a brief good entertainment to say the least...I believed the writers were trying to make it more of a sentimental kind of superhero movie instead. Which, don't get me wrong, it's a nice approach. As there were some touching moments and it can definitely bring out the tears (mostly likely affecting the sensitive folk) ...
I just felt it was a tad bit much (emotion > action). Maybe a nice balance of emotion and action would do be more suiting, as I've always felt this ""balance"" in the previous Avenger movies.All-in-all, it was still a good movie. Not that great as typically people would expect (from the overhype and all). The ending was a real nice touch to the franchise. Now THAT brought on the water-works. Salute to that!So thank you--- thank you to all those who've worked on Endgame. I believed you tried your very best and though it didn't satisfied me fully. It still left others happy, overall. So people, do give it a watch. As there's still some worth in it. *Salutes*",positive

"Just watch this movie. Not really been a fan of the Avengers series because it's been repetitive, same Heroes, same action, but this last one i found very entertaining and for me the best one.The story gels together well,but there is a lot more emotion coming from most of the Heroes which shows their still human inside and sort of makes you feel the character more. The main thing about any movie, if you dont connect to the characters, it will not be any good.The people whom make these films from writers to special effects must be Aliens, because they are brilliant , intelligent beings to do something like this, i mean you got to be someone special to do such a massive movie like this and keep it all together and so many stars.Please bear this in mind when you watch a movie like this, how amazing the people who are involved in this.",positive
"Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10",positive
"I won't add any spoilers. It was a great marvel movie, but not one of my favorites. They had so much information to try and wrap into three hours, that they just left gapping plot holes. 2nd half of the movie rocked, but still massive plot holes.",positive
"Here is my spoiler free review, I often like to discuss the negatives of a movie before the positives so here goes.I didn't quite enjoy Endgame as much the first time around since I had been spoiled about significant events in the film and it does suffer from quite a few plot holes. Some events aren't explained quite enough and require a good bit of mental gymnastics to hurdle. My main complaint like many others, despite not having much screen time, is Brie Larson (more on that later). Captain Marvel's movie, of which I do share the popular dislike for, was released barely over a month before Endgame. This is important because she is quite arrogant and emotionless in Endgame, a popular argument being Tony Stark is quite arrogant also, however we have had over a decade and 10 movies to watch and understand Stark's backstory and why he is this way, Captain Marvel not so much. I do however give Brie Larson the benefit of the doubt, after seeing how she is in interviews and such, I do believe the blame here lies with the directors. Larson and Marvel seem like completely different people. Her appearance is downgraded later in the movie too. There's also a scene with Fortnite.. which of course speaks for itself.All of the above is why I simply cannot give it a 10, one may think how can so many negatives only deduct 1 from a perfect score? Well, staying true to a spoiler free review that is quite the task to explain of course.As with any avid fan like myself and having watched Iron Man in cinemas 11 years ago, here we are 22 movies later and there isn't much more I could've asked for. Lot's of previous questions answered, closure brought to many story-lines, many epic moments and surprises. Had the franchise not been so long until this point, my rating most likely would've been 7.5. Somebody that has watched all previous instalments will appreciate Endgames nods at it's predecessors, lots of rewards for longtime fans. Is it as good as Infinity War? Not quite, it does shortly follow however, up there with my favourites IW, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man. A must watch for any Marvel fan. There are however still unanswered questions as with any MCU movie, which will most likely be answered in the upcoming titles.TLDR: Slightly political, plot holes and an undesirable character that ultimately get's trumped by the excellence of the other 95%",positive
"Wow! Concluding an 11 year phase, which has had some 20+ films, ""Avengers: End Game"" is an epic wrap up of various Marvel Universe films and, in particularly, it closes the book from ""Avengers: Infinity War"" which left a lot of cliffhangers.This film is a roller-coaster of emotions from start to finish, with a massive runtime of at least 3 hours, which is an awful lot. Personally I did not move from my seat for the duration of the film.All your favorite Marvel characters are present in some way or another. The film is presented in a typical comic book style; lots of the action which is extremely over the top and big, with moments of emotion that have the ability to bring tears to the eyes of even the most hardcore comic book fans. There are plenty of characters, most of which are allowed to have the development time that ""Infinity War"" just couldn't allow for. Sure it doesn't follow the true path laid out in the comics, but then it couldn't - the comic book universe and film universe are two different paths. The film represented itself absolutely brilliantly and gives cinema an epic masterpiece, the likes of which has been lacking for sometime - think ""Ben Hur"", ""Spartacus"", ""Lord of the Rings"" - this is easily along those scales as a generation defining moment. It's a vivid and stylish film with plenty of bang for your buck. I can not rate this lower than a 9/10.",positive
"It ain't perfect, no movie is, but Avengers Endgame is hitting on all cylinders from start to finish. It'll feel like one of those amusement park rides that once you get off you want to get back in line and ride it again and again.I guarantee you reviewers are using thesauruses to try and describe this movie and will fall short nonetheless.It is epic in every sense of the word. Period.",positive
"Can you use the prism of film criticism on a unicorn like the conclusion of a 22 film arc, two parter superhero extravaganza?Probably not.But even comparing it with other Marvel films or even Infinity War, this is an indulgent party which overstays its welcome. Like a constant rush of sugar, and some of those sugar highs are gloriously fun, at the end you are ready to say ""Goodbye"" and eager for something of substance.The major issue is that once time manipulation is introduced, then any existential threat is reversible.The first hour is ploddingly slow, the cast are good but boy they look tired and Capt. Marvel goes close to stealing the film.Despite that any film lover will have to see this...an event rather then cinema.",positive
"Warning this review is heavy on spoilers.That being said this is gonna be the best marvel movie by a landslide for a long time yes their are some unanswered questions left for future endeavors. That does make us think for a second what the hell, but long time fans and the people seen half of this series will perfectly understand.
This is an heavily structured movie.which consists three parts which is told in three hours. Well the movies starts with a broken and devastated team. The first hour of the movie focuses on the team putting themselves togather. Second hour is the solution for the snap. Third hour focuses on conseqences and the eponymous endgame.
Each and every character has his/her character arc and growth. Focused mostly on snap survived character and the core avengers team.had to add but even snapped have their moment to Especially Spiderman.This also works really well because it's well acted, written and directed. It's a combination that makes a great perfectly structurised movie. For me one of the flaws for infinity war is that cgi is clunky at times but endgame solved that issue. For me this movie is a solid 9.8",positive
"She is a minor character just like many others we have met throughout the years, helping out in the fight against Thanos.The movie is at times a little bit slow and dark (also in the literal sense), but is ultimately a worthy final chapter in Marvel's 22-film saga.There is exactly one 10-second ""girl power"" moment in the movie, so for those who worried that Endgame would become a ""SJW mess"", it isn't.",positive
"I can only conclude that Disney are using bots to post 10 star ratings for this film.
Infinity War is better in every conceivable way.
I have to confess that after infinity war I had no idea how they could possibly top that.... it was going to take some great writing to turn the events of IW and create a movie that was better again.......I didn't happen.
I can't emphasize how bad I thought the story was.
It feels like a desperate attempt to conclude this saga early so they can start on the next wave.
1. You can't introduce a character as powerful as captain marvel into a fist fight.
2. Never ever ever use time travel in any movie... unless it's a comedy like bttf or hot tub.
3. Don't create scenes that make no sense just to appease the woman's movement in Hollywood...cheapInfinity war deserved so much more than this.Do yourself a favour and finish your saga with infinity war and forget this mess of a movie ever existed.",negative
"The Marvel Cinematic Universe came to an eleven year, semi-conclusion, with this extraordinary film. It concluded a 23 film saga, rich with Marvel characters and stories, that culminated into an amazing franchise plot arc. Marvel hasn't missed a beat during this whole run and even though, we kind of, anticipated that, eventually, they would cross everybody over into one big, giant Avengers film, it still amazed a very satisfied public. It made the fans happy. It made the average, every-day, audience happy. It also was the highest grossing movie of all time, for a little bit. It was, hopefully not, a wonderful swan song for some as well.The Russo brothers had been spearheading the direction of the franchise's plot arcs, during this later half of the franchise run, with Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: Civil War (2016) and Avengers: Infinity War (2018). After setting up the big finale in the later film, everyone in the world wanted to know what happened after Thanos (Josh Brolin), snapped his fingers. The MCU had an appeal with audiences across the board. They were smart to mix up the movies, in a way, that they can attract certain sectors of the audience into the fold, in order to get everyone excited for this grand finale.This brings us to the final endgame and the fate of the universe hangs in the balance. Three weeks after the events of Infinity War, our heroes are still searching for Thanos, in the weeks since he did the snap and the great vanishing happened. Thanos wanted to eliminate half of life in the universe, in order to create a better balance for its stretched resources, but like all bad guys, he did it the wrong way. Enter the remaining Earth's finest heroes, who find Thanos, thanks to Rocket Racoon's (Bradley Cooper), knowledge of technology, but the attack on Thanos is futile. Since there is no way to fix things, the Avengers go back home to lick their wounds and wonder what will come next.Five years go by, the still-remaining Avengers stumble across an idea to go back in time and retrieve the infinity stones. By doing this, they are able to change the course of history before Thanos gets a chance to snap his fingers. A lot has changed in five years. The current stage of life on Earth is rocky at best. Things are not good. This plot direction allows the Russos to give the audience a wide array of interesting character developments that happen to our heroes. The lives of characters like, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Tony Stark (Robert Downey JR.) are playfully, but creatively entertaining and thought-provoking. The character development in this film is done quite well.The Russos piece together a tale that is perfect for the comic book fan, as well as, the general audience. Every character in the MCU gets a fair shake at making an impact in the overall plot. Every actor has their moment to shine. The villains have their moments too. The story is perfectly crafted to work as a major motion picture of heroic proportions. The film has a cool prologue, is set up in three nicely packaged parts and has a history making epilogue. They had the right story, based off of the original source material that made this enjoyable for audiences everywhere.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",positive
"It has taken many years and lots of work to build up to this amazing movie. This completely satisfied and exceeded my expectations for how I hoped they would pull this all off. I have been a huge fan of the movies leading up to this and this did it all justice. All the hidden ""Easter eggs"" from the other installments have been hinting towards this and I can't believe how big this has all gotten over the years. I was glad to see that even though this movie had a very serious fight at hand that there was still some classic Marvel comedy that made for some very funny moments. There was laughter, tears, and cheers through this movie. It was an emotional roller coaster that I already plan on going to again soon in theaters. It is a must see for those who have already been fans of the MCU and if you haven't followed it to this point this movie won't make sense or mean much to you so go back and watch the other movies. It is all worth it.",positive
"I think there's a cynical generalisation that Avengers: Endgame, and by definition the MCU, belongs in the same category as the likes of Fast and Furious, or Transformers, i.e. a lazily produced, generic production line, superficial big-budget, dumbed down blockbuster; watering down any substance and story in order to appeal to the mass consumer market. This couldn't be further from the truth.In fact, it's that willingness to be more brave and take an un-patronising approach with the audience which enabled it to become the highest-grossing movie of all time.Marvel took a gamble. They decided not to appeal to the lowest common denominator, but instead weave a rich tapestry of character arcs and narrative exposition, which was developed to greater detail in the 'trilogy within a franchise', i.e. Civil War, Infinity War, and Endgame. Indeed, I struggle to think of another movie in the MCU that does so much justice to all the characters, or encapsulates their all too human traits in such profound and tragic detail.I say that purely on the basis of scale, and Endgame's ability to 'cover all bases'. Take Thor, for starters. Now I read in one review that Chris Hemsworth's performance (specifically the comedic elements) was too 'on the nose' and overplayed. I couldn't disagree more. The Thor we see in Endgame is a complete subversion of the borderline toxic masculinity that shrouds him in previous instalments. He's broken, pained, tortured, and Hemsworth captures that in a sublime tragicomic reinvention of the character. Never have the stakes been higher, and never has a superhero been more mentally ill-equipped and insecure to face his demons. I think as a viewer we empathise wholeheartedly with that. Not all heroes are the one-dimensional, cardboard cut-out, indestructible, and incorruptible knights akin to Dominic Toretto or Optimus Prime (although these characters do get corrupted at some point or another this is carried with nowhere near the same degree of authenticity or pathos as Thor's). His ego, and self-esteem, have been dented (no, decimated) by his 'failure' at the end of Infinity War/start of Endgame. It's Endgame which serves as a spiritual journey for him, to pick himself up and prove himself ""worthy"" once more. This theme is underlying with most of the characters in the movie, in fact, but not in such a powerful, or personal, way as his. It's testament to Hemsworth that you don't know whether to cringe, laugh, or cry at his plight and instability. The term 'beautiful disaster' comes to mind.This may be just me, but I always thought of Captain America as something of a non-entity during the events of Infinity War. Come to think of it, that was almost certainly an intentional decision. After Civil War it's almost as if Steve Rogers is ashamed to be associated with the Captain America moniker (his dropping of the shield in the climax of that movie symbolic of his disbanding that identity altogether). He's become a more humbled shadow of his former self. You could debate therefore, that Steve depends on 'Cap' to harness his strength and resilience, that he's incomplete without him. In Endgame, though, we get a triumphant return to form. After the reality check that was the devastating resolution to Infinity War, his humbling has given him a newfound sense of heroism, confidence, and most importantly modesty. In my mind he's the stoic backbone, the rock in the team through which everyone gravitates around.Needless to say, the greatest character development comes in the form of Tony Stark. Robert Downey Jr's mesmerizing performance has been increasingly fine-tuned and nuanced as the MCU has progressed. In Endgame he finally comes full-circle. Once the selfish playboy millionaire who never truly stepped out of the shadow of his father's legacy, in Endgame his transformation is complete: making the ultimate sacrifice in a completely selfless act, but not before finding true fulfilment with the woman he loves, and finding true acceptance, or closure, with his father's influence in his life. The thing I found most profound with Tony in Endgame is his embodiment of 'the hero' archetype. For perhaps the first time ever in the franchise, in the form of his daughter Morgan, he doesn't need to wear the suit to be 'the hero'. He's just her dad, and that's enough. I think this is indicative to his character's journey from Iron Man. He no longer serves to his own self-interests, exacerbated through his previous use of grand posturing and artificial superpowers, but now rather displays truly heroic qualities from within, for the benefit of others. Tony Stark is the lynchpin which forms the emotional crux of the movie, made all the more heart-rending through the heightened sense of responsibility now bestowed upon him.One of the most surprising character departures comes in the form of Clint Barton, the reason being that in previous instalments there was always that feeling he was just there to make up the numbers. Maybe he'll pop a wisecracking one-liner, or show off some sick archery skills, but with no real depth through which the audience can truly engage with him. Fast-forward to Endgame, and we see him in a nightmarishly self-destructive spiral, slaughtering those he's decided are unworthy of having survived 'the snap', in some vain hope of avenging his families disintegration. Ironically, by the time we catch up with him in Tokyo any moral compass or conscience he may have possessed have disintegrated too, having turned into a violent mercenary alter-ego by the name of Ronin. It's a radical left-turn for the character, one which adds another layer of resonance into the failure and loss caused by the repercussions of Thanos's actions. Very similar to Thor you can see he's visibly traumatised, barely holding it together, ashamed, grieving, and now consumed by very un-heroic traits.Avengers: Endgame is just as must a story of redemption as it is a mission to reclaim the Infinity Stones. This truly is the fight of their lives, not just against a terrifying threat, but also against their own eroded feelings of self-worth and purpose. It's in this chaos that they must pull together, now more than ever. One of the notable additions to the movie which I must mention is, of course, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, the comic relief whose presence brings some much-welcome levity to an otherwise sombre start, and adds to the delightful camaraderie which underpins the teams relationship.The 'three-act structure' (beginning, middle, end), as highlighted by film critic Mark Kermode, is utilised to daring and startling effect in Endgame. There's something very haunting and elegiac about the entire first-act. The filmmakers allow time for the audience to immerse, or acclimatise, themselves to this new colourless reality where the heroes are down on their luck, barely getting by, wandering around aimlessly and looking for a new sense of meaning in the fallout of 'the snap's' devastation. This in-turn heightens the emotional intensity, and as a result our allegiance to the characters, ready for the absolute sucker punch in the climax of the movie. We're just as determined as they are to prevail in the face of overwhelming odds.There's a scene, which one critic derided, where Natasha Romanoff breaks down in tears while trying to eat a sandwich calmly and collectively. He argued that this was silly and was just there to pad the film out. I think he missed the point entirely. This scene perfectly emphasis the futility of our heroes readjustment to this new reality. Natasha is falling apart at the seams, trying desperately to put on a brave face, in the face of an inevitable and tragic truth. Sometimes a simple piece of storytelling like this can hold a such deeper meaning or resonance.I was also very impressed by the reinterpretation of Thanos in Endgame, as opposed to him in Infinity War. Whereas before he was a world-weary conqueror, disillusioned and ruthless but ultimately led by a sincere impetus of moral righteousness, now he's a despotic tyrannical warlord. No longer interested in preserving the sanctity of life in the universe, instead he pursues a more greedy and egocentric ambition, to wipe out life as we know it altogether, starting from scratch and fashioning himself into a sort of false God. It's this despicability which makes Thanos an even more threatening presence, especially when compared to our now-vulnerable and emotionally scarred heroes. Josh Brolin delivers another magnetic performance, and without his involvement I do believe the success of the Infinity War and Endgame would've been seriously compromised.The climax, when it comes, is absolutely electrifying. Basically the culmination of a 22-film saga, it's the ultimate reward for an audience who have persevered and followed these characters throughout an astonishing multi-layered journey. It runs the entire gamut, right from when the holy trinity of Iron Man, Thor, and Cap face-off against Thanos, to Cap's worthiness to wield Mjolnir, to the spine-tingling emergence of the portals/resurrection of the rest of the Avengers, to the battle to end all battles, to the realisation that a sacrifice must be made, to the period of mourning and self-reflection afterwards, and finally the transition of Cap/Agent Carter's ethereal dance into the end-credits montage, which is the cherry on the cake.Personally I found that Endgame was satisfying on every emotional level, so much so I left the screening completely astounded and awestruck. It was truly epic in every sense of the word. The directing/scriptwriting team of The Russo Brothers, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely should be lauded for their sheer commitment to the story and characters, and reluctance to sell-out for a quick buck. I think those who choose to disregard it as just 'lazy' and 'unimaginative' are cheating themselves of a hugely gratifying experience.",positive
"A must see,
Best movie ever!!!!
I really think this is the best super hero movie ever made!!!
Thank you Marvel",positive
This film is a very satisfying finale to 11 years of build up. The acting as always is amazing. The film as some great action sequences (especially the final fight). The film is able to combine the comedy that most of the other marvel universe films have and has very emotional drama. Overall Avengers:Endgame is a spectacular conclusion to the infinity saga that also has a lot of great fan service packed in to it and it does not drag even with a 3 hour runtime.,positive
I'm so grateful that in my lifetime I'm able to follow this journey of a epic superhero story. I salute every single one that made this possible from the beginning. It's not easy to keep all the actors working together over a few years to deliver something as big as this. And there isn't a single thing that I don't like about this movie. I won't say more but I believe many of you will be blown away like I was. Go watch it!!,positive
Good movie & emotional but not better than infinity war and 3 hours i saw it so long and first hour was so boring and for the time travel was so Provocation any ideas for time traveling Russo brothers do what they want and don't care for our minds I Think the time travel is owned by DC sorry marvel,positive
"This movie is everything. It's funny, sad, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and so amazing. Stunning visuals and storyline, Endgame is basically a must watch and it was a wonderful experience for me watching it.",positive
"Kinda slow eh? Long drawn out scenes where nothing. not even music is playing. Hulk did nothing, Thor was fat the whole movie,...and The biggest flop Ms marvel did nothing and was in the movie for 6 seconds in a less than spectacular final fight scene. Other than that the movie was pretty great...just slower and not as interesting as Infinity War.",positive
"Terribly disappointed in the effort. There should have been something ""more"". The movie plods from scene to scene with no real tension, almost as if marvel is giving the viewer the cliff notes on the last 10 years of films. Even the end battle was snooze-worthy, including the mostly useless Captain Marvel showing up as the deus ex machina.",negative
"To the best 11 years of my life. Thank you, Marvel, thank you for making my youth have a perfect ending.",positive
"Come on, it's one of the best comic book films of all time. Fun, funny, and emotional. I'm not even going to spend time reviewing it really. I'm in the midst of rewatching the MCU and one thing I will say is this: Robert Downey Jr. Is a gem. At this point he could've really phoned it in and few of us would've noticed or cared but he gives everything he's got in this performance. He's the best actor in the MCU.",positive
"This movie is great, emotional, epic with lots of great moments and the ending of the movie is the best and when the movie ends, there is going to be a smile on your face with lots of tears on your eyes. The only people who say this movie is bad are only toxic dc fans and the ones who don't know what is cinema. Endgame absolutely is the best marvel and the best comic book movie have ever made.",positive
"That movie is best movie of all my favorites movie. Acting, Cgi, Story, Humor, Action, Development is just perfect. It is the end of infinity saga. None movies can beat that movie. You must see that. That movie will make you laugh, goosegumps, cry and love that movie. I know everyone is confused with time travel, but just enjoy movie. It is betauiful end of og 6, but clint, thor and bruce will still be around. I will miss tony, nat and steve. Alot peoole is angry for thor and hulk, but it is not end for them.
You will love that movie more than 3000.
Whatever it takes.",positive
"The best of marvel, a rollercoaster of emotions im not yet recovered of this epicness. Very good even if you dont like suoerheroes movies",positive
"If you saw Infinity War, I think you knew where the overall arc of this would go. I went into Endgame a little arrogant, thinking I knew the whole plot. But one of the big surprises that this movie drops is that it constantly subverts expectations. If you've managed to avoid spoilers, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with where Endgame goes. What I thought would take the whole movie is done and fully explored in the first 15 minutes. This is absolutely a good thing, superhero movies are always at their best when they're experimental and unafraid of abandoning the formula. While I can't say it completely split off from what was expected, I was excited with every turn or twist in the narrative and I have to applaud the creative team for not just retreading the formula and delivering something off-kilter, at least for the MCU.Unless you aren't familiar with the marketing, Endgame largely centres around time travel and I was also impressed that they balanced this concept while running through the emotional gauntlet. Most time travel stories come in 2 varieties, the goofy comedies (I would put the Back to the Future franchise, Happy Death Day, Hot Tub Time Machine etc.) or in the completely serious (11/22/63, the Butterfly Effect, The Time Machine). Endgame puts a spin on it where the stakes are very real but you get the classic humour from the best MCU entries. Its a fine line to walk but Endgame does it as an art form, the movie is both very funny and at other points heartbreaking. Its harder to accomplish than you think (even in a normal movie as opposed to this gigantic franchise picture) but they got it done. They also handled the time travel aspect well, some movies fall all over themselves trying to explain how time travel could exist but this was a situation where other than some technobabble, they add a few lines as a catch all and then they move on. Maybe that won't be good enough for some but I just accepted it and kept going.With so many movies and so many characters to include, doing them all justice and giving everyone ample screen time would have been impossible. But another highlight of Endgame was that they gave all the original players (Ironman, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye) a side story or mini-arc that was both respectful and added to their respective stories. Its amazing that I can say that just thinking about it now and I tip my hat to them again. I did see this with a group of diehard MCU friends and one of them was upset with how Thor was presented in this move, so it may not be flawless for the whole contingent of fans. But I didn't hear many false notes played and every bit flowed together well. I was also pleasantly surprised that Nebula (played by the wonderful Karen Gillian) got a satisfying amount of screen time that payed off well, it mirrored Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) subplot in Infinity War. The only one who I was disappointed in was our villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) who was a much more interesting character in Infinity War. You could relate to his thought process and identify with him, I feel like the support he got threw Disney off and they made him more of a sadistic jerk in this one to get the desired reaction.This movie and this franchise features the cream of the crop with the A-list of Hollywood actors and actresses. They all excel together and apart and there isn't a weak performance in the group. This shouldn't be news, with a cast of this calibre, there wasn't even a chance that there would be a weak spot. Some people get more to do than others (I doubt you're going to see this for Don Cheadle's inclusion but if you love War Machine for example, he's not a major player in the action) but everyone does top notch work and I expected nothing less.There's so much good here that it feels weird to say anything negative. The only thing that really caught my attention is that after the first 15 minutes, the rest of the first hour drags compared to the rest of the movie. It's not uninteresting or boring but it feels like when you're cranking your engine to start your car, you're waiting on pins and needles for the movie to really hit its stride. It gets there and it does its job incredibly but you are waiting for it to fire up for a little while. The other note I would give is that with the inclusion of so many characters, some of the appearances are a little one note. Ant-Man is there to largely dump exposition and pump up Cap and Carol Danvers is in the movie way less than what you would expect (I was in the camp that enjoyed Captain Marvel, if you didn't, this may not be such a bad thing). But these are very minor issues in a movie that scores at least 9/10 things right.Endgame will be so many different things to so many MCU fans, whether you see it as a kick @$$ blockbuster, the culmination of the MCU to this point, the final farewell to some of your favourite MCU originals or maybe the best action movie you'll see this year. I think it does about as good of a job as you can expect (if you're even a casual Marvel fan, you're going to dig this) with the pressure, the expectations and the weight of all the success the franchise has had dominating the box office for over a decade. There are points of the movie that are slow and not as interesting but when Endgame kicks into gear, it flies down the road. I still slightly prefer Infinity War but its a 1A) to 1B) comparison as opposed to one being a 10 and the other being a 7. Unless you're suffering from serious superhero fatigue (which I wouldn't blame you for) or just dead set against the MCU, you're going to really enjoy this movie. Endgame is a 9.5/10 that checks all the boxes and caps the MCU to this point in a fun, touching and above all exciting 3 hours at the theatre.",positive
"Okay..so spoilers be darned..THis movie was kinda very slow. Still a great movie. But can we talk about the ""Captain Marvel"" SCAM. They tricked us into thinking that Marvel played a big part in this movie. When she only has about 12 seconds of air time...12 seconds...ok that is an exaggeration...it was probably 10 seconds.",positive
"No comment needed.Best MCU ever. Chris Evans i love you. Robert downey jr you're da bomb. Chris Hemsworth. Scharlett johanson, she is my spirit animal.",positive
"Well, just got back from watching this movie. I'm a long time fan of all the MCU movies since the very first Iron Man, seen each one of those 20+ movies 3 or more times each. I was in awe after watching Infinity War (IW) and I had the highest of expectations for the EndGame. The joy I felt watching Thor with his new blueish glowing axe and sparking eyes in IW was something imprinted in my mind. Yes, I really expected some glorified battle at least between Thor and IW did gave me the impression Thor is now the mighty superhero, the strongest at least to guide everyone else to whatever was planned to reverse the damage of Thanos in EndGame. Within the 15 first minutes instead of a mighty Thor, we get that laughable drunk guy??? WTF Marvel.Time travel? Ok... it may work or it may not in a movie. But honestly didn't feel like a suitable mechanism for the MCU universe. It felt like the ""easy to get back mechanism"" trick to restore whatever we have shown so far to the fans. I would rather prefer somehow an arcane ancient relic to be searched and found that would do the trick rather than this ""seen so many times"" approach of time travel. Honestly, didn't like the whole time-travel thing.The final battle... not even close to what we have seen in IW. Despite having every hero in there, it was very flat. Thanos was presented as just a bad guy, not that smart impressive genius and ""correct"" in his own mind"". He didn't had the stones, still he looked like he is indestructible. How come this guy has such strength??????? I could say ok if he had the stones, without them, he still is an impossible-to-beat hero.Captain Marvel... well I hope MCU does not expect this character to be the new superhero to stand up and carry the whole thing to phase 4. One major issue is she is much more powerful than anyone else. I can't connect with that easily. Even Thor which I believe is the strongest among all superheroes had to go through a lot of pain and suffering all these years to reach at least his maximum potential (to watch him ruined by the authors in the most disgusting way... but let's put that aside). Captain Marvel? No, right at the start she can fly, needs no air, spits fireballs and can bring down a whole spaceship in seconds. So, why the heck she wasn't there in the front line to finish this battlse right away?? Utter crap.Finally, deaths of superheroes. Why why why why why? If you want to retire a character, there are dozen other ways to do that. I felt like these were forced deaths. Ok, I can understand some could die one way or another but all deaths seem to be rediculous; the whole point was just to eliminate them from the future MCU. Ok, just retire the characters in a memorable manner, no need to kill them. It felt like a part of my heart was ripped away in the worst manner; completely unjustified deaths. Other reviewers explained that much better than me and I completely agree with them.Overall, it was of course visually brilliant but lacked in what matters, the story and this makes it an average film really. Not completely disappointing but didn't feel it made justice to the whole MCU phase 3 or as a worthy IW sequel.",positive
"This movie was a joke,average superhero movie where the heroes win and everyone's happy, hounestly zero dialogue this whole thing is just liked because marvel is ending, this movie made people ""cry""?really?the only thing that made me cry was my money I spent on seeing this garbage, thor was ruined along with hulk, thanks was dumber down,and capitain marvels horrible scenes were pain full to sit through,hounestly I'm glad people are coming to their senses and rating this movie lower now that they rewatch it, it's full of plot holes and the time travel is embarrassing lazy writing that's a disgrace to real time travel movies,besides the hype this movie had nothing it was 100% hypebased in fact I dont think anyone acctually paid attention to the movie, the ending was extremely predictable and the final battle was bland with the only background colors being brown and destroyed ships so disapointing after the amazing movie that showed that superhero movies can be more then saving the day and the bad guys losing",negative

You've read all the reviews.
And you're living under a rock if you haven't seen it yet.JUST GO SEE IT!",positive
"This review contains spoilers.Avengers: Endgame is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War and is the conclusion to the infinity war saga. The movie takes place after the conclusion of Avengers: Infinity War and has the heroes attempting to reverse the cataclysmic snap that occurred in Avengers: Infinity War.Avengers: Endgame does a lot in the movie. This is an ensemble movie that has a lot of expectations. For the most part, the movie is able to meet the expectations. There is a grand spectacle for audiences and an impressive climactic battle. The movie also delivers solid character arcs for the three original members of the Avengers: Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. These characters have the biggest tie to the Infinity War saga and to see it all come back is worth the price of admission.Thanos is still an intimidating villain, but in this movie he is not the same. The Thanos of Infinity War was killed and the Thanos present in this timeline is an alternate version of him. They have the same goal but they are different characters. The movie uses Thanos as more of a concept as the heroes already killed him at the opening of the movie. The movie did not have much in the way of a back and forth between Thanos and the Avengers. That was one of the better parts that Infinity War was able to execute and have impacted the story. Infinity War made the villainous characters in Thanos' employ more intimidating. They felt like more genuine characters instead of being the background filler they became in Endgame.The plot to time travel was a surprise but it was expected. As the series wants to keep its characters, there needs to be a way for them to come back. The time travel plot was expected for the surviving characters to undertake. What was exciting was that each of the time travel moments was used to do character development. Chief among this was Tony Stark talking to his father. The time travel arc felt like a hybrid heist plot. Once all of the stones were collected, the movie went into the final battle.The final battle is visually impressive but the problem was that Thanos' army was impotent. Thanos' army seemed to only be present to be shot at and beaten up. The army was not intimidating at all despite so many characters from Infinity War making an appearance. The villains were much more intimidating in Infinity War. The battle was an obfuscation for the game of hot potato that occurred between Thanos and the Avengers.I would recommend ""Avengers: Engame"" directed by the Russo brothers. This is a solid conclusion to the original Avengers.Grade: A.",positive
For a 3hr film it flies by. Ties up the MCU nicely and the best film I have seen in a while. Highly recommend,positive
This film is a Super Movie but if you didnt watch other avengers Movies dont watch it. It full of wonderfull moments like the war of thanos,positive
Just watched avengers endgame for the second time (still watching the credits) and the first 2/3 made so much more sense!! Been about 6 weeks since I last seen it and I loved it then too! (More so the fight scenes but now I've gotten much more clarity on those marvel Easter eggs!! Very well executed and very smartly orchestrated too!!,positive
"Avengers: Infinity War was a pretty mediocre film, all things considered. It suffered heavily from overload (too many characters and plot-lines) but Avengers: Endgame ties things up really well. So well, in fact, that I've watched the film three times now and I'd be up for watching it again sometime in the future.You've got humor, strong emotional pieces, a much-appreciated smaller cast of characters and an absolutely fantastic final act.Avengers: Endgame is simply the gold-standard for the MCU.",positive
"Predicted end !
Weak drama !
Graphics was not that high !Infinity war was way better than this !",positive
No superhero fan will be disappointed with this movie!,positive
"The hype surrounding this film after Infinity War was unavoidable. This is the finale to a very long lead up of films and that final action scene is money well spent. Endgame doesn't have that flawless conclusion but at least it's ambitious. It is exactly how a massive ensemble cast should be filmed and it never feels one sided, it's an Avengers film. My issue with the film is more about the repeating villain and large plot holes left from the time travel. It lacks answers and leaves the clean-up to Spiderman Far From Home. I miss the times when films had to be complete and explained. Infinity War was a better film and offered more.",positive
"Overrated, boring nonsense movie playin da appeasement game.. Infinity war set me up for what I thought was going to be the best marvel movie ever but end game felt like it was trying too hard to please everyone!",negative
"When Thanos snapped his finger, it shook the world. How could Earth's mightiest heroes avenge the ashen fallen? Could they at all? Would any plan they concoct be plausible, successful, or, most importantly, dramatically satisfying? Now that we're at the Endgame, our fears are meeting the truth, and what a glorious ending it is.
This Marvel Universe experiment should've been an unwieldy disaster; just look at what DC failed to do. Producer Kevin Feige has created a hand-wrapped gift to those of us who love epic storytelling. The ""Infinity"" franchise has been a symphonic display of heroism, comedy, pathos and ethos that unbelievably ""concludes"" with its most emotionally substantial film ever. Endgame culminates tears, cheers and years of storytelling into one incomparable piece of epic finale storytelling, the likes of which we're rarely lucky enough to see on the big screen.
Unlike most of the Avengers films, the Endgame story lays heavy on its viewers. Dense, long, and somber, it can seem burdensome, until you realize how immaculately constructed and lovingly toned it all is. Each character gets their moment(s), and not just superhero poses and fan service throwaways. They get to be human, making their final standoff not only a battle for the cinematic ages but a heartfelt dramatic timebomb, hearkening recent saga classics like Return of the King or Deathly Hallows.
I'm keeping the details light to avoid spoilers, but Endgame is so much more than its individual plot points. The quiet sadness, cheer-worthy action and inspired sparks of humor are too transcendent to be ruined by some words on a digital screen. These superhumans have given us a glorious celebration of the goodness of being human.",positive
"Infinity war was amazing, but end game is just behind, i dont want give spoilers.

I love this movie. ..hope there will be another one like this,positive
"Avengers: Endgame will be a film that I will never forget. When I first saw it I loved it. It serves a satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga with how it wraps up what was started in Infinity War while giving wonderful send offs to some of the most recognizable characters that we've grown to love ever since 2008. Overall, this movie was fantastic and personally is and will be a film that is not forgotten due to it being such a satisfying conclusion to the already great Infinity Saga",positive
"Avenged Endgame serves as a super nice popcorn movie. But the building-up for the final battle happens way too slow, way too dull. The battle itself is epic but ends too soon in my opinion. Some of the punchlines in the film seem too contrived and almost bored me into tears. The movie tries to dig in all the main characters but fails to convey the depth. With that said, the visual and sound effects do deserve being appreciated in an IMAX movie theater.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame' continues from its previous instalment 'Avengers: Infinity War', where a chain of catastrophic events destroyed half the universe. The remaining Avengers now come together for one final time to reverse the actions of the evil Thanos and restore the order of the universe.Overwhelming. It best describes the final chapter that culminates Marvel Cinematic Universe's 21 iconic films into one. And that also describes the experience of watching your favourite superheroes come together for a singular goal, for one last time. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo ensure that the humongous build-up and the avalanche of expectations do not get the better of them. They deliver a largely wholesome product that is full of moments laced with action, emotion, comedy and drama. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely take you along, even if you haven't been following the franchise. They do an incredible job with the screenplay to balance emotions with visual spectacle. So if you're not a fan yet, chances are, you might become one after watching this instalment.Avengers: Endgame is also several films in one because of how it's meant to serve as a farewell tour for the original gang of six who headlined The Avengers: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Since it's the final chapter for most, Avengers: Endgame is naturally built around them, so it can tie up and put a bow on their standalone arcs. And it delivers on most accounts, with a couple of tragic deaths, a dose of wish fulfilment, and even a possible tease of an enticing future. That does mean other characters, War Machine (Don Cheadle), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper), aren't as well-serviced, others like Nebula (Karen Gillan) merely serve the plot, while the likes of Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) barely feature.While the screen time for each character is not equal, their significance in the story is. And there are enough surprises in store, as far as their fates are concerned. 'Endgame' delivers quite well on the emotional quotient, bringing out superpowers and vulnerabilities of its cinematic demigods through their measured performances. From an upright Captain America (Chris Evans) to a stoic Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and from a straight-faced Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) delivering the punches to the reassuring presence of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), 'Endgame' has it all and a lot more. Thanks to the conviction in performances, you also might just find yourself rooting for the bad guy, Thanos (Josh Brolin) at some point. However, it's the comic collective of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Ant Man (Paul Rudd) that ensures there are enough lighter moments in this otherwise heartfelt finale.The action becomes progressively intense, but never overbearing. In fact, it remains relevant and true to the narrative, such that it weaves in enough opportunities for major plot twists that even the diehard fans may not see coming. The extensive CGI work adds to the visual appeal, even in 2D.In celebrating the past, Avengers: Endgame does more than just help bid goodbye to the original gang, some of whom pass the torch to the next generation before they walk off into the sunset. (After all, Marvel has the future to think of.) It allows the audience to reflect on their own emotions as well, for how the superheroes speak to them about responsibility, teamwork, and love among other things. Avengers: Endgame is the culmination of what is ultimately a blockbuster TV show on the big screen. The MCU is unique in what it has achieved here, and it makes you wonder if Marvel itself, let alone someone else, can create something like this again. For the time being, it leaves diehards with many questions for what's to come and how the universe will proceed after such a seismic event.For the non-fans, the film's explanatory tone might come across as a speed breaker at times, but for the fans, the same invokes hope and excitement, leading to constant gasps and howls.Overall, 'Avengers: Endgame' is a befitting tribute to the Cinematic Universe that has spawned larger-than-life superheroes and super fans. At three hours plus, 'Endgame' delivers on a lot of its hallmark promises, leaving its fans with a range of emotions and fond memories.",positive
"My quick summary of Engame:
How is Thanos so damn powerful all of a sudden?
Why spend 10 years explaining the power of Caps Shield and Thors Hammer n Stormbreaker only for Thanos to show up with a random weapon that is unexplained and is way more powerful?
How is Sam the new Cap when hes not a super soldier but a normal human, especially considering all the epic encounters Cap went through now we have to believe that Sam is of similar strength n stature?
And my biggest question... Why the hell did the MCU introduce Captain Marvel at the end of Infinity War like she was going to be the saviour ( even giving her a solo movie ) then only using her for a total of 5 mins screentime in Endgame which ended with her struggling to beat Thanos n then getting blasted?? What was the point of that? Shouldve just saved her for phase 4! Shes basically the Superman of the MCU but cant match Thanos?i scratch my head..??",positive
"This movie is pure awesomeness. This is a movie, i will be remembered for eternity.
Just a big thanks. Cinema was never so much entertaining.
Can't wait for blu ray disk",negative
"So, when i just looked in here for viewing the ratings, all i ever saw was 1 rating. I don't know what's the matter with the haters and i never will. And honestly, i don't care. I just wanted to say it.Now about the movie, it was a masterpiece in many ways. First of all, the performances, the ensemble cast. It was a beauty. Then Silvestri's music. The story, the pacing, the humour. Then the emotional depth, RDJ's acting.Everything was right about movie. The cliffhanger of Mjolnir wielding was exceptional. I loved it. I always will.",positive
"Best Avengers movie till now, the acting is good but the deaths of our favorite characters are heart breaking. Hope they didn't die. Overall bad people lose and good ones win. 😅",positive
"This movie is near perfect. It doesn't work without the MCU films that came before it, but if you've seen them all, WOW. packs a serious emotional punch. Fun, funny, sad, I got all the feels.",positive
What an amazing movie loved it gutted with the end though,positive
Avengers endgame is in my opinion one of the greatest superhero movies of all time it's a great ending for iron man captain America and black widow the battle is amazing seeing all the heroes from the mcu get together to fight thanos each time I watch I get really excited theres not much bad to say about the movie apart from I didn't like what the did with Hawkeye but thats the only bad thing I have to say about this and I'm really excited for the upcoming movies in the mcu,positive
This movie deserves an oscar. If you haven't watched the movie yet you should watch it.,positive
"There are so many 10/10 ratings on here for this film but frankly it's not that good, the hype was better than the film. Yes it had great moments and I'm not saying it's a bad film because it's not. But it's not the best film the MCU have ever made.",positive
"This movie was freakin awesome!!!!! I can't believe it was 3 hours long. The story was so good that it went by fast. It had a little bit of everything. I gotta see it again and I need it as soon as it's available to purchase. If you haven't watched all of the past Marvel films, do that first so you're not lost but I promise you will enjoy this film either way.",positive
"I am not a Marvel fans so I hadn't seen many marvel movies so far . I think a good movie
especially such magnitude like avenger 4 should let most people can understand content even I didn't see other marvel movies before. As a non marvel fans moviegoer , avenger 4 is not a good movie for the audiences like me . So that why I think this movie has wild room to improve because I still think audiences like me are not the minority",positive
"Spectacle and nothing else
as fans said here its meant to be for them but even they dont like it
totally undermines the excellent previous movies for too much fanservice and useless plot threads that go nowhere
sadly ive seen this movie twice and regretted it both times
such a slack way to wrap up what was mostly a good-excellent run of movies",negative
"""Perfect"" is the only thing I can say. Could not imagine a better ending.",positive
"There is no other way that an amazing journey like Avengers could've wrapped up. The fire started with Iron Man in 2008 with some marvelous people including the one and only Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreau and ended with the epic piece directed by the Russo Brothers. As Tony Stark quoted, :""part of the journey ended"" and left a legacy to being remembered by so many generations. The movie is definitely a masterpiece of this era which puts us on emotional rollercoaster, enjoy a flashback of the memory lane and a lot of kick-ass stunts. It tattooed our head and heart so deeply that we can never move on from this brilliant piece of jewel. One can only hope that marvel will lit the beacon again in the coming years to sustain this honorable legacy.
My advice to all the people, Go watch it, even if you are not a fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe or ""superhero"" movies, you would find it once in a million worthy for spending your money and time both.",positive
"I agree with many other reviews in that this Avengers is over hyped. However, this movie IS STILL REALLY GOOD. I think a lot of people are giving it bad reviews because people had too high of expectations. Infinty War was a lot more action-packed and became a legendary film partly because Thanos's victory had such a large ""wow factor"" to it. In terms of pure enjoyment, infinity war takes the cake. However, the plot to endgame is really good and the action scenes are still pretty amazing.Honestly, my main disappointment with this movie is what they did to Thor's character. Thor was an amazing character in IW but in endgame he is kind of pathetic, DESPITE becoming one of the most powerful avengers by the end of IW. Personally, I wish they had found a better way to use Thor's character in this movie.",positive
"I find this an amazing ending to a grand series of movies. I can agree with most the flaws of many previous films, from pacing to forced plots at times, but this movie manages to tie everything down so nicely.Also a very exceptional end to an exceptional hero, Tony Stark. Sad that RDJ will soon be leaving the MCU franchise, but this movie has definitely given me hope of looking forward to future movies following what is left of the Avengers, and how everything will go from there.",positive
"Endgame was the most hyped film of the season for three reasons. One is the shocking anti climax of infinity war which ends with a cliffhanger. Second it was rumored to be the last film of most of our favorite characters due to various reasons so fans were mentally preparing themselves to see them for the last time and say them goodbye. And last is that the makers remained tightlipped regarding the film which increased the curiosity level of the audience.
With all the hype, does endgame meet your expectations? Let's find out.Positives:
The film is divided into three acts. Though the first act is slow its very intense and emotional. The second act was the most entertaining where time travelling is done as it has many funny moments. And the third act was action packed which provide you goosebumps and in end makes you emotional.Now let's talk about our favorite characters.1. Iron man: With 3 standalone movies, main lead in all avengers films, second lead in civil war, a cameo in incredible hulk and an extended cameo in homecoming, RDJ kept on earning the love of audience making him the God of MCU. In endgame, he once again win your hearts. Your heartbreaks when you see him skinny and weak in the beginning. He had some heartwarming moments with his daughter and also when he hugs his father while time travelling. And in the end when he snaps saying his epic line ""I am iron man"" and dies he nails a heroic image among audience. Don't know how MCU will be without him. We love you 3000.
2. Captain America: My favorite character in MCU. In 8 years cap's character was constant being a serious, mature and no nonsense Steve Rogers. In first avenger and the avengers everyone felt him as a boring character. But in winter soldier, he proved that he can be badass like James bond and Ethan hunt. In age of ultron he got a bit sidelined whereas though civil war was his film audience saw it as an avengers film. Plus, he earned the wrath of iron man fans for hiding Tony's parents murder and they mocked him saying that if bucky wasn't there then iron man would have killed him in the end. Later in infinity war he got less significance though he was given a great intro. In endgame, he plays a very crucial role who keeps on motivating his friends. And I thank Russo brothers for giving him the most epic scene where he lift Thor's mjolinir. That scene showed what cap is worthy of. And he gets a happy ending where he time travels and goes back to Peggy. Thank you Chris Evans for making Captain America my favorite character.
3. Black widow: though we miss her badass action in endgame she wins our hearts for sacrificing herself for the soul stone. Especially the fight between her and Clint to die for soul stone is tension packed.Negatives:
I can't believe how Russo brothers ruined the character of Thor whose fan following grew leaps and bounds with ragnarok and infinity war making him the second favorite avenger. I understand that he was depressed for not going for the head and it was fine showing him as a fat drunkard but in the end at least he could have given him some elevation. I liked professor hulk but we missed his smash. Also we wanted a rematch of him and thanos. Time travel concept is confusing and compared to infinity war, thanos character was less explored here.Verdict:
On the whole, endgame is a highly entertaining and engaging film despite being for 3 hours. But compared to infinity war it was not that satisfying. It will be a treat for iron man and cap fans. Thank you avengers for entertaining us for 7 years.",positive
"With among the biggest anticipation for a film ever this film needed to deliver and it did just that.A comparatively slow start was great build up to a huge ending and an excellent ending to the saga.Massive shocks and big plot twists make this a film that's essential to see twice to take everything in I think. The acting and animation is about as good as it gets for now. Some great humour as well.I will be shocked if another film in 2019 tops this in the film charts and maybe, as sagas go, star wars is now knocked off its perch at the top.",positive
"The movie was ok, not willing to watch the 2nd time",positive
"Since we started watching Iron man when we were teens up until now 11 years and 22 movies all those came to success for this movie Endgame. If it is not like this there can't be any other better ending.All of the hard work was worth it.
And RDJ you made us marvel fans and you made the mcu what it is today.",positive
"The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a behemoth. A cultural phenomenon that has enveloped the minds of audiences everywhere. Since 2008 when 'Iron Man' graced our screens in a small yet metal-bashing blockbuster, we knew something big was happening. Deep down. And now, eleven years later, this fantastical journey of spectacular conflicts and personable characters has come to an almighty conclusion. Generations have been anticipating, for a whole arduous year, how the remaining Avengers were going to stop Thanos post-snap.The burning question raised from this extravagant superhero soap opera: Does Endgame sufficiently conclude the franchise? It's an inescapable thought. Endgame was no longer just a film in an elongated series of interconnected stories. It was answers. We needed them, and we needed them executed satisfactorily.So, does it? Yes. A resounding yes. My inner fanboy was pleased with the sheer amount of fan service shoved into this epic three hour beast. The third act especially, which we all know is the climactic battle (I believe I'm safe to say that...), is teeming with mesmerising energy as the Russo brothers shove as much glorified content as they possibly can. However, do not mistake my inner child-like demeanour as a critical analysis of the film, for am I not blindsided. It's very easy to succumb to the colossal amount of fan service and forget about the criticisms. I would not do that to you.Treating this film as I would any other, I found myself embroiled with many reservations. This is not a perfect film. It is flawed with contrived plot conveniences and a narrative structure that segregates its tones far too excessively, consequently producing inconsistent pacing. Problem is, I am unable to discuss these issues with you. In fact, it's one of those rare films to which I can't really say anything at all, for it may be deemed a spoiler (and I'm not falling down that Asgardian pitfall again...)! Let's try though.The first act explored the humanistic drama beneath these heroes. Conflicting emotions as they adjust to the immediate vacuous lives after the events of 'Infinity War'. An interesting direction from the Russo brothers took which injected a dark melancholic aura, cementing the finality of this franchise. Then, the second act kicks in once a particular character is re-introduced. Let's just say I wasn't overly enamoured with the film during the second hour. Intrinsically implementing a barrage of references from previous entries, to the point that it becomes overstuffed and a detriment to the overall arc of the plot. The beautiful development of Thanos from its predecessor seemingly shattered in this instalment, resulting in a simplistic antagonist. And the exaggerated comedy came across as desperate, especially from Thor. Whilst appealing to general audiences and acting as a crowd pleaser, it unfortunately didn't gel with me. I blame 'Ragnarok'.Thankfully the third act saves the day, with what I can only describe as a sublime celebration of the cinematic universe. That is what Endgame is all about. Celebration. From the heart wrenching moments (yes, please bring a tissue or twenty) to the chaotic action, the Russo brothers celebrate eleven years of work into three hours. The last hour was entertainment done perfectly, and left me with moist eyes and a smile across my face. Performances were top notch from all cast members, especially Downey Jr., and I had minimal qualms with the visual effects. A few action scenes were edited haphazardly, but just a small nitpick in the technical department.So, let me change the initial question. Is Endgame the perfect superhero blockbuster? No. I would go as far as saying I believe 'Infinity War' was better executed and remains the best 'Avengers' film (not to be mistaken with best MCU film). Yet, regardless of my insignificant disappointment for the film itself, Endgame had enormous pressure. It could've simply buckled under the weight. But it didn't. For that, I applaud Marvel Studios and everyone involved. You don't need me to tell you to go and see it, just do it.",positive
"I just got back from seeng this on the big screen; first time to a movie house in 40 years.I will start by saying I do like Marvel and their superheroes...that being said, I felt Infinity Wars was too fast paced and lacked a coherent storyline. With all the hype for Endgame I was expecting a similar fast pace...only to be amazed at how boring the first half of the movie was. YES kiddies, a full hour and a half was literally 'snoozy time' when it comes to any story at all. To tell the truth, at one point about an hour into this I was thinking I was supposed to be thinking up excuses for why there was nothing of substance going on...For the entire three hour time frame, there could not have been more than 15% total with action of any amount in scenes; and that felt more like it was thrown in as an apology...frankly, I expected more; much much more than was delivered...at least all the characters who disappeared in Infinity Wars came back in Endgame...The short opinion...Huge Disappointment!",negative
I love how the directors overtly manage to embed and portray potentially cringe moments in the comics on screen!!,positive
"World is broken. 5 years on but still broken. But then is a hope, a small chance. They gather the remaining of the team (broken, depressed ) and go on for the challenge. But now they have a plan, ready to sacrifice and get along with their past differences which they lacked in Infinity War. Story goes total nuts. The time travel, retrieval of stones without actually disturbing the timeline but complicacy happens. The end fight is superb. The fallen are back and universe vs thanos happens. Who wins? You have to see this.
Completing the characters arc for many superheroes. IronMan, Vision, BlackWidow, Captain America. End of infinity stones chapter(fingers crossed). How they filmed the meetups during fight was good. Visual effects, sound were brilliant. and the wedding scene!
Returing the stones is a bit complicated and why it didnt disturbed the timeline? Rest is goooood.",positive
"There have been attempts for decades to emulate and transition the wonderous tales of comic books into visual, live action media. Many of the times, though iconic, things would end up too campy and unintentionally humorous, being as much a symbol of the first strides into film as examples of how NOT to do things.
But for a long time, Marvel was the underdog, even just 30 years ago, when it really was the powerhouse of the comics industry, with the best characters, and amazing adventures.
Even with the films of the late 90s and early 2000s, it was a while until the Iron Man film released in 2008, reviving Robert Downey Jr's career and giving him a much needed second shot in the spotlight of public attention. And it worked. Still the only dvd I have from any of the films ever made, and even with some other properties that did or didnt do nearly as well, there was at least the feeling that it would all lead up to that sweet, sweet juicy crossover to end all crossovers. In the realm of comic books themselves, the now classic crossing over of characters that literally existed in the same timelines and worlds, was still a big deal. Once this took place in film with he avengers movie, I just knew, upon seeing hints of Thanos, that something, someone would have to bring that world shattering, universe splitting dangerous presence to the playing field.
However, even if one compared all the stories and their film versions against the comic book counterparts, even when people say "" oh they are just kinda like the Ultimates versions of them"" I was still not satisfied. Though I almost always enjoyed the characters for what they were and what the actors portraying them could bring to the MCU, there was always a longing for more. Even with a Thanos that was a bit too soft, and too talkative, and not as powerful as his comic counterpart ( the hulk too was nowhere near what the comic character could do), I still enjoyed the films.
Through it all, and the patience of these last 11+ years, Endgame finally rewarded fans with a gripping, and fairly emotional ride through one of Marvels most beloved and ground breaking stories. Plot holes and the occasional pandering and some bad writing mean little as this era closes, along with the aging final year of the '10s decade(2010s) and this great film. Though this has been my extended opinion
, I highly recommend any fan of the franchise of comics that loved other MCU film to see this one. Check it out before disney tries to sell all the films together in a $500 dollar blu ray collection set thats not even in 4K and makes the infinity gauntlet look lightweight.
I am pleased to see families and young folks going to see the things which shaped the perspectives of so many like myself all those years ago, and with the closing of the curtain on the majority of the MCU, but all of it, we pass the torch onto the next generation. May they too 'forge' ahead, and reach for the infinite.",positive
"Writing it right out the cinema, the film was an incredible adventure, a must watch for the fans,
But --->spoiler<---- Tony Stark's death killed me inside.",positive
"It's literally almost a year ago to the day that I returned home after seeing Infinity War where exactly what I feared would happen did. I.E. meaningless deaths that meant nothing (Gamora, Loki, ALL the heroes who vanished after the snap), as well as a painfully predictable ""Part 1"" cliffhanger ending that copied the decades old comic book storyline beat for beat. In short, Infinity War was a MASSIVE disappointment overall.And now a whole year later......we have Endgame. Which featured NO obvious deaths, NO copying of any existing comic book storyline, and also managed to be the single most gratifying and well executed ending to a long-running franchise in all of cinematic history.Long story short......Endgame >>>>>>>> infinity WarThe year long wait to finally get it right was worth it.10",positive
This movie was a 10/10 in 3D iMax on the opening weekend. Simply one of my favorite movie experiences,positive
The hype for this film was better than the actual film. Whilst it did pick up towards the end most of the time it was mediocre. There were plot holes that didn't make sense in the established MCU timeline. What they did with Thor's character could have been really good but it felt too forced. Another forced thing in this film was the all female fight scene and was a bit over the top. Although Valkyrie riding a Pegasus was amazing. I think the MCU would really benefit if they stopped putting so many jokes in their films and made them darker. Of course that'll never happen whilst they're under Disney.,positive
"The best superheroe movie ever, every single moment is unexpected with an epic end",positive
"I enjoyed watching the previous ones.Now this one is too long, 3 Hrs.",positive
"This movie is awful. Shot very badly, the editing gives you a headache and doesn't show any movement of the camera. I'm not particularly a fan of the other avengers but this is a total bore all the time except the last quarter of an hour where there is action but thinking about it even the ending is stupid.",negative
"I 100% didn't feel that this movie is 3h long, Though this will be good to watch at home, Endgame is one of those movies that was made to be a cinema experience, in 3D or not (but it was better in 3D). I believe in most of the developments and paths the characters chose. For a movie with so many characters and converging plots, Endgame doesn't feel too packed.",positive
"Without revealing too much, I enjoyed the movie. Yes, three hours sounds like a lot, but I managed to do it without pausing for a bathroom break. Now that I think about it, this is the last time I'll sit through a three-hour movie. But enough about that.The movie grabs you and won't let go until the end. The three hours pass pretty quickly and even though Stan Lee is no longer with us, I'm sure he got a proper send-off. I just don't remember where. But I'm glad he was a part of the MCU movie saga. All of the Avengers do battle with a powerful enemy. Who will survive? Who will not? All that will be revealed when you watch the movie. If you've been following the MCU closely, this will be the major climax.",positive
They couldn't give every hero equal billing (they tried with Antman & Captain Marvel which is the minus one star) so they made the movie all about the original Avengers from 2012 and...the movie does not disappoint. Couple of 'wow' moments with a generous sprinkling of sweet tender moments throughout. The best finale anyone can ask for and a fitting curtain call for the original Avengers. Kudos and a big THANK YOU to the Russo brothers!,positive
"Finally we got a worthy ending to the dc universe heroes with this 22nd and final film in the saga.
3 hours of entertainment which will leave u wanting more.
although not as great as part 3 was still this is worth of your time as u get entertained often with lots of laughs and a lots of flashbacks as we get to see the past many times as that was the plot in this movie.
this is one of the worthy dc films as we got a ton of those in last decade due to high $$$ earnings and not all of them were good.
at least the last two avengers movies were great.
now I hope we get a big break from those movies until they figure out what they will bring next.

"If there's also any single phrase that sums up the guiding principle of the Marvel Cinematic Universe it's this: Hold that thought. (Truth be told, with Endgame's running time of three hours, ""hold that bladder"" would also apply.)But the bottom line is that it's as hilarious as mush as it is Heartbreaking.It's helpful, before going to see Endgame, to cast your mind back to the contradictory feelings of that final scene. This one focuses on the efforts of Cap and the remaining Avengers to implement a do-over - essentially rewinding the effects of Thanos' snap - feels at once sad and deeply satisfying, complicated and surprisingly comic. If many of us have grown up with the MCU, the films themselves have also grown more complex, like a fine wine.In a sense, Endgame is an example of the MCU cannibalizing itself, but it has always done so. And it does so here in a fresh way that is closer to homage than lazy appropriation. These affectionate flashbacks also serve as a tip of the hat to all the loyal fans who have held this sprawling mythology so dear.Spoiler Alert? Sure! THOR IS FAT!!!As high as the stakes are in Endgame, it is also a very funny movie. The humor of the story - some of which takes place in the future, five years after the end of ""Infinity War"" - has to do with surprising ways in which the lives of certain characters have changed (along with their personalities and, in some cases, their physiques). If Infinity War was about failure, Endgame is, ironically, all about acceptance and moving on. After 11 long years, the Infinity Saga is finally, fulfillingly over.There is no post-credit scene. But oh, what a going-away party these old friends have thrown for themselves. You'd certainly be in more tears then you were during Infinity war's climax. Tears of joy for most, that is.",positive
"Characters getting to little screentime, one of the biggeste heroes reduced to comic relief. Former build-ups waisted. No clever twists. Loong wait while the heroes reminisce. A great bad guy turned stereotypical.
Meh... for me the line best ended with Infinty War. That was a great movie",positive
"Honestly this movie could have not been done in any better way. It ends the dead/retiring characters arc's in an amazing way and it sets up the others just as well.
I also didn't know I needed Korg playing Fortnite in my life.",positive
"I am not a big fan of Marvel movies. They are on average pretty dumb, makes no sense, and no internal logic or coherence, and usually ends with a horrible CGI massive and boring battle. This movie is exactly like that. But like most Marvel movies it is also very fun. The first two third of even better than average, the first act being 'The Leftovers' - Marvel edition, and the second act a fun heist movie, but the ending is so by the book and uninspiring that I was quite underwhelmed overall.
If you want to see good action - MI6 last year put the bar very high, and this movie was not even close.",positive
"The ending of the Infinity war was perfect - some died, some survived, it had everything - comedy, thrills, action, it was the perfect ending. And then this garbage came and everyone is so obsessed about it, everyone raves about it. I watched it and I was in a complete awe. Why did you ruin it? Why are they alive again so other characters can die? I know it is for money but this to me was one of the worst, most disappointing ends of all time. I dont get the hype, to me the whole universe is ruined with this lame moneymaker move.",negative
"21 films, 11 franchises, 11 years An Epic end of an Avengers Era!!One of the best MCU film I have ever seen in my whole Life.The movie has everything that you needs. It has enough thrilling and fighting scene along with great amusing moment. The cast played in movie is brilliant specially Robert Downey Jr, Chris evans, Chris Hemsworth.
Not only these movie is epic but also very emotional. Last 30 minutes you can felt how heartbreaking and emotional for the True marvel fan when our favorite avenger Tony stark A.K.A iron Man died.
I can only say that these movie gives an amazing conclusion to an epic journey.These movie really deserve an Oscar",positive

A job well done!",positive
"After 21 movies, this epic saga has come to an end. Avengers Endgame is one of the finest superhero movie ever made. The movie perfectly captures what made this franchise so unique and dear to all the fans. The movie is packed with humor, emotional moments and offcourse some epic battles. Those who are the old fans will obviously love this movie but the new ones who haven't seen any marvel movie would still find something good. Overall this movie is not just an movie but an experience. An experience of lifetime which can only be enjoyed on the largest screen possible.",positive
"There is no favorite egg at the end of the movie. Many people have been waiting for a long time in the cinema, but they didn't wait for what they wanted. Later, some people said that there were colored eggs. It was the sound of making armor in the first part of iron man. There were 11 knocks, indicating that in the eleventh year of marvel, when I went to watch the film for the second time, I had to wait for a long time at the end of the film to listen to the sound...",positive
"Good but this has the most problems out of any phase 3 marvel film. Time travel is cheesy, none of the acting was EXCEPTIONAL except for RBJ. They didn't know what to do with Thor or hulk but they didn't really focus on them too much so its fine. Captain Marvels character is terrible. None of the time travel stuff makes sense and they keep breaking rules. Why is CA on the bench I thought it created an alternate timeline. When nebula was caught why didn't she GET OUT OF THERE. Your particles still work LEAVE. Why can't Captain Marvel snap the gauntlet, she's the strongest avenger. Anyway it was still good, it's kinda just pros vs cons but it was fun (except for the first two acts).",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is an abundantly gratifying finale that rewards long-lasting loyalty to the series. Endgame is visually magnificent, it looks stunning with phenomenal scale and is executed exquisitely. Emotionally invested, we feel grief, pain & struggle.
This movie belongs to the originals. Tony, Steve, Bruce, Natasha, Thor and Clint. This is their story. A movie that will last for a very long time. I love you 3000.",positive
"A brilliant ending to the Avengers series. It doesn't top Infinity War which is simply in a league of it's own, but it does do it justice. It's a slower pace than Infinity War, but the build up is worth it.I knocked off a few stars for what they did with Hulk and Thor, who were two of my favourite characters from the franchise, especially after Ragnarock.It's a shame that there won't be another Avengers movie after this one, but I guess all good things come to an end.",positive
"First, i gave it credits, it's the most hyped and overrated movie of 2019...Imagine eating a very long steak unsalted and with no condiments.. yeah... that's what i felt for a very long 188 minutes...The movie is boring to the point making you watch the hours for at least 2,3 times, to make some sneaks to your facebook, news, sports, whatever... and why?Because it's extremely confusing, unfunny, action scenes are too fast paced and superficial, emotions are artificial and slow scenes are excruciating...Glad it's a end game....",negative
"Soooo. Just finished the movie and this will not contain any spoilers but I need to voice my heart to all Marvel lovers... 22 movies over 11 years and this one movie profoundly used all of them in the final conclusion. My heart is saddened by the end but so over joyed by the extreme care the Russo brothers took to preserve stan lees finally curtain call. This movie was the perfect mix of humor and emotion and I can tell you I have never cried so much in a movie ever... Being an iron man can it truly does end exactly where it begun!!! Phenomenal movie, true cinematic perfection and this movie will sweep come oscars time. But words cannot express my feelings! The end of an era and a movie that will top box office records for centuries to come!!! Thank you marvel, and thank you to the actors for giving the fans something to remember for a lifetime",positive
"In many ways, this movie serves as a love letter to the long time fans who have been here since the beginning. Unlike Avengers Infinity War, Avengers Endgame focused on the six original characters. It brought Hawkeye aka Ronin into the fold after being absent in Avengers Infinity War.Avengers Endgame is hilarious, emotional, action packed, brutal and just plain insane. All the six original characters had their time to shine in this movie. Hulk and Thor were the funniest characters in my opinion. They both served to give comedic relief in this movie.The visual effects and cinematography were amazing. It felt as if you were a part of this movie. The final fight against Thanos was amazing and seeing everyone who turned to dust reappear again was satisfying.The death scenes were extremely emotional and unexpected. I did not expect Black Widow to die as her own standalone movie is in the works. I guess her movie will serve as a prequel and will be set entirely in the past. Even though, Iron Man was on top of my death predictions list I did not want him to die. His last interaction with Spider-Man and Pepper Potts was emotional and made me tear up a little.It was surprising that Steve Rogers aka Captain America did not die as he was also on top of my death predictions list. Steve Rogers retired as Captain America and passed on the mantle to his friend Sam Wilson aka the Falcon. This was unexpected. I thought that Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier would become the next Captain America.To conclude, Avengers Endgame is a phenomenal movie. It is the culmination of 21 movies and three phases. It completely blew my mind and exceeded all my expectations. Avengers Endgame has become my favorite movie of all time. I love this movie 3000!",positive
"After 22 movies that slowly built up to this point, it was nicely executed, yes this one has some drama, some background on people's lives after the Thanos ordeal from the Infinity War, how people / characters changed etc etc. Has usual light heart witty jokes, the of course the Grand Finale, Watched on IMAX -3D and totally worth it. Got the tickets the first day they went on sale, Kids were counting days... Totally Worth it. Cant wait for it on Blu ray.",positive
"I'm eating peanut m$m's while boringly reading crap reviews, I would like to talk to some of these people and ask what they want. Why can't people just enjoy movies, it's a super hero movie, nothing is real. It's for fun",positive
The movie was great with the best ending I could ask for in a superhero movie (that I predicted BTW) and the action was on point!,positive
"Well.
Where do you even begin with this one.
Obviously I love the movie.
Infinity war was amazing, and the expectations were very high for endgame.
To me they delivered big time.
The way the movie made the characters arcs come full circle, with the previous movies.
And the funny Easter eggs only a marvel fan who has seen the previous MCU films.
The tone of the film is very dark, much darker than infinity war, which was a very colorful action packed movie.
Endgame has very dark lighting.
The depressed feeling the movie has the first half, is very effective.
THE HEROES LOST.
It's interesting, to see that side of a superhero story.
The acting is amazing in the film.
It's filled with surprises.
And the set ups from the previous films pay off very well.
I had a very cathartic experience watching the movie.
Obviously it was very sad a times.
And the whole experience felt like a big ending.
Even though more MCU films will come in the future.
This was definitely an end of a 10 year era.
I highly recommend this movie to every marvel fan!
Even though everyone in the world has seen the movie pretty much.
I can't wait for it to come out on Blu-ray so I can watch it many more times!
One of the coolest most unique experiences I have ever had in a movie theater.
I have witnessed history.",positive
"The film is good enough, held together by the fact the Russo's know how to do set pieces and some pretty decent superhero performances from the main characters. Hence the 7 rating.
When Infinity War launched last year it shot straight to the top of my favourite film list. Endgame had the tools and opportunity and freedom to be better, it's just not. I have watched IW about 15 times and still get shivers when Iron Man first suits or Thor landing in Wakanda and stark vs Thanos, well this is just movie genius.
In comparison Endgame has terrible pacing, after 2 hours of time travel nonsense we get to the only real battle of the film and it felt rushed and messy. There was no time for character placements or anything. The whole throwing the gauntlet round like a football felt like it was out of the Incredibles.
They tried the best for fan service but as a huge fan i'm so sad about the list below1) Hulk actually fight at all especially Thanos
2) Iron-man use a new suit to actually wow me
3) Totally absolutely ruined Thor. This was an absolute travesty
4) Thanos was ruined alsoActually there is a massive list of things that I would have liked done different",positive
"I'm assuming the low ratings are by comic book nerds. This movie was amazing. A laughed out loud, by myself, many times and cried a lot. I'm really surprised by how much considering this is just a block buster super hero movie. The thing is, I actually like movies. And I know they are entertainment. Are there holes in the time travel plot? Sure, but who cares. Just use your imagination to fill in the holes. Or don't think about it too much. It's not real life folks. I'm just grateful I live in the exact period of time where movies like this are possible. It's amazing what they can do. Imagine someone from the 1920's or 1820's saw this? Be grateful. This movie was a masterpiece. If you want less plot holes, watch a film, or read a book. This is a movie. And a damn good one.",positive
"Avengers : End Game was way too long. They could have wrapped up this story in 1hr 30min instead of stretching it out to 3hr. If you are less than a rabid fan I would recommend that you see this film at home. The crowd in my theater was attentive but strangely quiet and I didn't get much of a sense of excitement from the audience. Black Widow and Hawkeye had the best stories in this film and Ironman second. Ant man showed up and was fun and Rocket (the trash panda) represented the Guardians of the Galaxy (I'm a big Rocket fan 😊). I did not care for the Thor bit. I was disappointed with how they handled Thor's character - it just wasn't funny. The other Marvel characters showed up but the directors could have just set up cardboard cutouts and had voiceovers for all they contributed to the story line. It does not work as a stand-alone film - you have to have seen the previous films to understand it. I made my poor sister go to the movie with me (she had not seen all the previous films) and she felt tortured and bored (her words). She said that I now owe her ""big time"" Sheesh...",positive
"This is by far the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. Ever.I was looking forward to it after last year's Infinity War, to see how they would bounce back from that Thanos snap. But boy, was I disappointed. The whole ""time heist"" plot is tortuously senseless, it lacks any form of intelligence from any aspect, be it scientific or imaginative. What kind of ""writers"" are responsible for this? Or what were they on while ""writing"" this? The quick one-liners, barbs and quips are cringe-worthy and so are the ""comedic"" situations.One can objectively agree that the movie is way too long and boring for the first two hours, even my 11 yo super-fan brother thought so. It offers very little entertainment. The plot is too incoherent for any sensible adults and very complex to follow for the young ones so they just eagerly await the battle finale. Which does arrive at the end in the form of a badly choreographed CGI bukake scene with pyrotechnics and many, many cuts for anyone to follow what the heck is going on.Massive, glaring plot-holes abound from start to finish which I bet are invisible to the throngs of fanboys all over the world over-hyping and claiming this piece of hot, leaky garbage to be the greatest movie ever made. Along with giving it over the top reviews and ratings.Can't believe this is what sells to the masses and makes studios billions of dollars now. Makes me lose all hope in future superhero movies. I couldn't wait for it to get over and go home. A complete waste of time.",negative
It's the best way possible to end properly the avengers saga.,positive

The end of an era. It was a good movie but probably infinity war was better.,positive
This emotional ending is perfectly balanced with the action packed setup from Infinity War. Marvel did an amazing job making an often-surprising and satisfying movie to tie up all the plot threads. There is nothing quite like the MCU and this movie displayed how far Marvel has taken each of its characters relationships throughout the last 10 years. Loved it!,positive
"I'm not really a fanboy but I couldn't resist watching all the movies.
And it is true:
-the three hours feel like less
-emotion is insane (I had tears in my eyes too)
-acting is impressive
-action is awesome
-finale is epic and movingGo watch this best marvel and superhero film and enjoy the top of 22 films!",positive
Ok so first off the movie is definetly worth watching as it can be fun and even epic at times. But for me and a lot of people it came off as very slow and bland aside from a few jokes here and there for the first hour and 45 minutes. First of all the whole tony and nebula thing at the begining felt like a waste of time considering they brushed over it and had capt. Marvel save them like nothing showing that that scene really had no purpose. Everything else up until they show thor is all good. But yeah once fat thor shows up it is like a kick in the nuts to thor fans. We always expect to see a massive epic thor entrance but to get this just really genuinly sucked and really shows that Thanos is not the most powerful of them all. But there are more ways that they could've nerfed him they didn't have to make him fat. Now moving on to the stone collecting scenes i understand why they did some of the things they did and some of them were smart little nods but these scenes just felt like they dragged on way too long as they feel like half of the movie. After collecting the stones is when the movie truly shines and the final fight is arguably one of the best superhero fight scenes to ever hit cinemas. It does feel like the epic conclusion to 11 years worth of films. But how they chose to end it with cap dancing with peggy is a bit underwhelming. So overall as i said the film is definetly worth the watch but i do not believe it is worthy of the 9.1 it got nor do i believe it is better than Infinity War or The Dark Knight for that matter.,positive
Wow. I saw this movie the exact day it came out and I was kind blown by it and the fact it has permanent deaths in it is mind blowing. I will miss iron man alot and I wish to god he is only in prequels like before endgame cause even though I would like him to be in more films it would be a dumb move to add him back. One think I hate about the film though is the runtime 3hours and 1minute is about too long. Other than that I love this film. You should check it out if you haven't already.,positive
"First off, I enjoyed part 1 (Infinity War) like no other Marvel Universe movie. It was dark, ominous, the protagonists/heroes kept being kicked around and failing again and again. At the same time, the bad guy's ultimate motives were not-that-malevolent and adding the depth of his character (e.g. expression of love for his daughter) the result was making the viewer to like him, even if he was destroying our heroes. Unpredictable, mature, complex. Amazing.Liking that much the first movie was a tough start for part 2 -Endgame, as it might turn out not to be equally good. And it wasn't.I felt the plot this time was oriented to teens. Much more linear, super predictable, not-fresh ideas. The atmosphere was brighter, the plot shallower, the humour and acting was awkward at points. While in the first movie one hero dies in the first scene, in the second one gets getting better and better till a ""happy end"".Captain Marvel does not really participate in the movie, since she is OP (overpowered) and would ruin the balance. She just shows up to justify having her own movie and the last scene in Infinity War.If there was a cringe contest for this movie, it would be tough to decide between Thor or Hulk scenes, but first prise would definitely go to the ""all-female"" battle scene, which was there for no reason in the multiverses.All in all, the movie felt like a goodbye festival for Marvel movies, full on forced emotions, trying to explode inside you with the (very few) final casualties. But the recipe didn't work. Logan, was a success in this field, not Endgame.Watch it, just don't expect too much.",positive
There was nothing unexpected in this one. Of course the characters that were dead somehow came back to life. We all knew that had to happen before we watched it.Obviously this kind of movie is made for children and for adults with the minds of children. But I can't imagine any normal adult enjoying it.,negative
"Something we've obviously not seen before, and not sure, even with Marvel, we'll ever quite see again.It includes everything: development of already great Characters, spectacular action and incredible effects, humour, happiness, sadness - honestly, what more can you ask.Really don't know how they can possibly top this - up there with the very best of Action films, like Raiders.....",positive
"If you want, you can certainly find several weaknesses in this film. But why spoil the fun? As someone who, as a child, flicked through the superhero comics with big eyes, this film is a childhood that has come to life. Sure, it's a bit overloaded, but it always remains surprising, it's an emotional conclusion and, above all, a film for the fans, which became clear when half the hall jumps out of its seats and shouts ""Assemble"". And for that I say thank you!",positive
"The film was moving, stunning, emotionally driven, and filled with deep meaningful stories, and authenticity throughout. RBDJ deserves an Oscar nom for this performance, as does the film and its leaders as a whole.There were sniffles from beginning to end, laughs, claps, gasps, and a tangible optimism and heartfelt camaraderie in the theater.This film was brilliant across the board.",positive
"THIS IS A NON SPOILER REVIEW
Avengers Endgame picks up where Infinity War has ended. It's full of story, full of heart and full of respect for the characters that we know and love profoundly.
It's also beautiful to look at and has much better editing than most of Marvel. There are beautiful long shots and it's a spectacular view.
If you love Marvel, if you have seen all (and in this case I recommend seeing all MCU movies before this one - trust me, it will help you understand many parts) then you are probably going to love this.
And the marketing did do it justice - it really feels like an end of an era.",positive
"It's absolutely ridiculous how this movie comes close to perfection. Considering the characters' story lines and how much this film does for fans of the franchise, it's truly a masterpiece.",positive
By far the best movie I've ever seen. All the MCU films have been leading up to this and it does not disappoint! Go to watch this film before someone tells you what happens!,positive
"Okay, again I don't know how to define Miss Marvel, she sometimes seems powerful, but other times seems weak and most of the time completely useless. She claims not to have time for Earth when Thanos snapped, yet if she had been there she might have help or prevented it from happening in the first place.
Yet I don't know if she has the power, as it's all over the place. Okay, she somehow flies and shots energy beams by getting the power from the Space Stone ? Makes no senses.
But at last she's got powers, strong enough to fly through leaser beams and a spaceship, yet not strong enough to get past common foot soldiers ?
Okay a fluke I guess.
Later she tries to take the gauntlet from Thanos, something even Cap. American almost did alone, yet she can't, but she can take a headbutt from him no problem, it is almost like he is all CGI right there. Sigh
And she has the IG for a long time, yet she never takes it on to end the treat, no it has to be a normale human that does that, even though it seems she would handle that power just as good as the Hulk,as she did adsorb powers from a stone with no problems. And she has plenty of time while the female ""heroes"" assembles around her to help her, becasue her powers are all over the place.Why did you take so much away from Thor and Hulk, we really needed the two most powerful heroes in this fight, yet they are reduced to jokes most of the time, and Thor just say that he is no leader in the end, yet that was what Thor 3 was all about.Then there is the death of Black Widow, the one we all hoped would finally get a movie, guess this is Disney's way of telling us no on that.
The death of Ironman felt like the death of the Marvel Universe, the journey that came to a close and was telegraphed from a mile away.
And lastly you made Cap. America grow old, at least with his love, but it would have been better to show his slow aging instead, so he could still be a supporter to the cause.I feel like this is the last movie of Avengers we will ever get, as they are almost all dead, left or retired, and the supporting actors don't seem like they will go on either. We will get Spiderman and GoTG I hope, but it really will not feel tied in any longer.Also there is a huge plot hole in the movie, as there is now double the amount of all people again, yet for the last 5 years they have only needed to grow food for the ones that din't die, so there will be world hunger for years on all planets. Not to mention all those that died because the pilot, driver, nuclear engineer and so on was snapped away will still be dead.
So there will be lots of wars and unrest in all the world, not to mention the people that came back is 5 years younger in mind and body, but would be 5 years older according to the justice system and so on, and would have been declared dead so they wouldn't have any assets either.",positive
"People laughed, clapped their hands, some of them cried (including me). And what a satisfying ending, honestly this is best one yet.",positive
"The End. So we were told. So much hype, so much stuff to watch, 3 hours plus. Did not did justify at all. Time travel ? That is the solution, wow! so cliche. A lot of plot holes, no major epic battle, even the major epic battle that it shows it ends in 5 minutes. Very under in many parts. I did not expect so many cheesy lines, especially the ""I'm Iron Man"" come back.What i loved was the new haircut of the gorgeous Brie Larson,which btw was it all CGI ? did she even appear in the movie ?As far as the give away of captain america, ok wee need to show diversity once more and it ruins everything. Who is this guy ? are you serious ?",positive
"I managed to watch 40 minutes of this crap, and then could not stand it any longer. You must be a true fan of Marvel Universe to see it until the end. If you are not, avoid - nothing makes sense in this utterly boring movie. Acting is really bad too. High-end special effects cannot save it.",negative
"It was a bit slow and somehow the drama and emotional charge does not befit the characters. It felt shallow.
I saw no point of bringing Captain Marvel in. She came late and felt completely disconnected from the Avengers.
Hated the way of portraying Thor's depression. A fat drunk, really? That everybody makes fun of, come on! Like I said, shallow.
Aside from some minor plot holes, a few characters missing substance and an over-all crowded feeling, the film was a great endeavor and brought some inspired closure.
I am curious to see what's next.",positive
"How you rate this other than a 10 is beyond me. I love infinity war and it's probably more #1 but this is a perfect film. I laughed,cried and cheered. The ending sets up the future movie's which I'm excited for. I'm assuming the black widow movie will be a origin story. Definitely worth watching!!!",positive

I feel like i miss something after this movie. i wanted to see monumental fight scenes where our heroes use all they power with such dedication anger but also with pain i wanted too feel how much they need to give from them in order to save our planet. it was not that dramatic (also music could be more dramatic) and this is my most minus to this movie. i felt like oh now they will do same fight but with just better ending for the universe. captain marvel well first of all i prefer long hairs over the cut version but it's not that important. she has great power in most scenes she is doin all alone destroying all on her way. but in last scene i saw that she needs some help to go through all that aliens horde it was so confusing .... also thor ... he is one of the strongest so where are these dark clouds and thunders destroying multiple hordes ... where is hulk who jump in the air to destroy ships... if feel like i saw different scale of their possibilities in this movie. well beside that it was fun and as a fan to all superhero movies i will buy blue ray to see it again and maybe search what i missed. i used to cry after infinite war after endgame hmm not rly.,positive
"It's so well put together and emotional that anything that the film does badly is simply superfluous. The acting is spot on, the humor is good but not over the top. It wraps everything up so nicely, and the emotional moments make you feel. Iron Man dying had me in tears with his ""proof that tony stark had a heart"" floating across his lake. Captain America choosing to go back to his love in the 40s was gut wrenching. Everything was tied up, and it does feel like the end of an era in cinema. There will still be Marvel superhero movies. There still be heroes to look to. But new names will be taking up the mantle. It won't be the same, but not necessarily in a bad way. It will be just different. The end of the movie really hits you with how much these characters have changed in the last 10 year and 23 movies, and how things are different now. At first I thought the time travel narrative would be incredibly hokey, but it was so well done you can't help but give it credit. It's the most interesting use of time travel in a movie in a long time. Everything has been wrapped up. The only loose end is Loki and where be went while they were back in time. I guess time will tell.",positive
"One of the best movies I've ever seen , simply EPIC , Enough said",positive
"The movie was strong but it had a lack of fighting scenes and the final battle was kinda lame.
Ant-Man was freed from the quantum universe by some kind of rat.
They snapped with the glove twice.
The glove became like an American Football at the final battle.
The time traveling was confusing. I mean it was hard to understand how time works. At the beginning of the movie the understanding of time traveling was fine but after Captain America changed his past somehow it was hard to understand maybe it was just me.
The movie becomes a mess at the ending and just ends like that. I don't even know how Captain America remembered or even knew The Avengers after time traveling.
Almost forgot to say that Thor became fat and he took his old hammer from the past and then Captain America got to use the hammer. That is kind of a weird concept to me.
So a 7 is a fair rating to me",positive
"The movie was exhilarating, super fantastic, stupendous, I liked everything about it. Well done Russo brothers, you'll have ended the saga in a way that's very brilliant yet heart breaking.

"OK So 3-Hours is Not Little Time for a Movie.But with a Universe so Vast and Varied with Characters and More Characters Interacting and Interweaving among Various Plot-Lines and Adventures,3-Hours can Barely Contain Any Kind of Finality that is Completely Satisfying.But the MCU (Marvel Comics Universe) has been Leading Audiences to this Point Through Over 20 Movies.So it had to Wrap-Up at some Point. So They Could Reboot and Start All Over Again.The Production Crew did an Entertaining Job of Touching on the Major Characters with Touching Tributes and Insights.The Plot Utilizes Time-Travel, and that is Always going to be Touchy.So, with All Time-Machine Movies it's Best to just Let Real Science Alone and Focus on the Fiction of Science-Fiction.It's a Sentimental Movie. After All it is the End of a Long-Lived Life of these Superheroes and Endings do Tend to be Emotional.The Action has its Thrills and Spills in the First Two ActsCombined with a lot of Exploration of the Past.There is Certainly a Big-Bang for the Buck.But the Action in the Third-Act is one of those Battle-Royals where the Screen is Filled form Left to Right, Top to Bottom with Characters and Machines.All in Hyper-Motion and Tasks the Eye and the Brain to the Limit of Human Perception.This can be Exhausting, Incomprehensible, and Tiresome.Just Trying to Take-In any of what is Happening On-Screen.Let Alone Investing in the Power of the Presentation.It can be a Bit Much, even for Fan-Boys.",positive
This movie hits all the right moves and I couldn't have been happier with how they concluded this Marvel chapter.,positive
"This was obviously the best MCU film to date and im pretty sure everybody that saw this can agree. Without spoiling it there are some very sad moments but thats the most i can say. The whole story was great and it was just as good as any other great Marvel film. Even being a non-marvel kinda guy i actually liked the whole avengers series and i thought this was a good end to this 4 movie series. Watching these movies changed my mind about the whole MCU movies and i thought they were cool. Still not a huge fan but i enjoyed them for the most part. This movie is just a legend, enough said.",positive
"I was a bit nervous / anxious of seeing this movie, and thus got a mountain high expectations. When leaving the movie theater I was like: ""Was that it ?!"" but a day later I changed a bit my mind: it's a nice movie, but not worth a 10/10. I would give it a 7,5 but you can't give 0,5 point here :)
The very first part of the movie where Thanos is being killed is interesting because it got a nice twist, I thought ""How they gonna fill these 2,5 hours now?"" but then everything becomes the expected battle against Thanos we were all waiting for, the battle could also have been a slightly bit more epic, it was epic, but not epic enough imho, knowing it was (for the moment) the very last battle of the Avengers.
I liked the ""evolution"" of Thor after 5 years, but I didn't like the Hulk evolution, smart & brutal is usually something that doesn't match together.
The role of Captain Marvel in the movie is also disproportional, she is extremely bad-*ss during the whole movie, but when she fights Thanos they seem to be the same power...
There are also some illogical things about past / present / future characters (like killing the old Nebula has no effect ?) but it's not such a big bummer.
To be honest I preferred the ""Infinity War"" movie, probably because I wasn't expecting so much from that one as for Endgame.",positive

"I should say , Avengers Endgame could have been far better and way more incredible if around 20-30 minutes were trimmed off from the runtime that includes the first half scenes .
181 minutes is too much time and it is disappointing to see that half of this film is not worth it . A binding of 22 films and ending is satisfying and the best ever but , for the movie as a whole 8.5 IMDB (as per now) is over rated and the credit goes to MCU fans who got swayed with just last 40 minutes of the film for which I think they came .
This movie was not better tham Avengers Infinity War .",positive
"Personally as person who isn't too much into all this comic book stuff, I watched this and it wasn't even mediocre. This was a terrible movie. The drama, characters and action all where really bad. There were still some good scenes in the movie, however over the 3 hour long movie, most of it was terrible. A lot of the acting felt forced, especially with the female superhero actors. There was not a good presentation or an interesting and surprising ending. Not to mention the terrible comedy spread throughout the film. Constantly repeating jokes that were not funny, and lots of references that were rather unfunny and forced.This felt like a nerdy fan film sequel to the really good movie, infinity war.",negative
"The final battle, you really can not imagine the joy. The audience has been screaming all the time, and the scene I am looking forward to is really boiling when it appears on the screen. Three hours. I thought it was long, but it was short. As the last part of this stage, let us see the flesh-and-blood superheroes, not the rich and handsome men wearing expensive armor or the gods with their own lightning, The time machine not only takes them to find the original stone, but more importantly Let them marry. Let Marvel powder see that the original superhero is also emotional, just like watching the wolf uncle late. Humans create superheroes to satisfy their fantasies, but in the end they have not forgotten that fantasy is a fantasy life (a life without superheroes)!",positive

"Ship load of superheroes - Check (Eyes-full in an IMAX screen and some more)Stunning action setpieces - CheckSharp sparkling humour - CheckEmotionally charged moments - CheckEpic finale - CheckDirector duo Russo bros dunk us neck deep into nostalgia as we buckle down for a dreamy ride skimming over a decade worth of our favourite blockbusters from the franchise. Their nifty screenplay pulls together plot lines from all those multiple moments of magnificence to a rousing crescendo culminating in yet another audacious, heroic and dare, I say heart wrenching snap.
It is beautiful in how the writing draws on the twenty plus historic blockbusters to create what is going to be the definitive piece in the history of blockbusters.The movie delivers on almost every countAs sheer spectacle of ginormous proportions..As an energetic and exciting entertainer..As an emotionally charged roller coaster..
Russo bros have crafted a fitting farewell that elevates our favourite superheroes even as it pays an ode to each of them who would remain etched in the collective memories of the fans for a very long time, if not forever.Don't see how it could've ended any better ..Perhaps could've had some more fireworks ..Perhaps it could've been more 'snap'py.. But, again .. am just nitpicking here.Go .. Watch it in the biggest screen possible !",positive
"An interesting film and quite successful conclusion to the story with all the main and third-party hero lines involved to this point. But there are two minuses: soooooo boring and unnecessary stretching of dialogues and meaningful looks at each other which stretch the film even more... and a completely artificial looking drama where they tried to show it, especially with inappropriate jokes that are considered normal for Marvel's films in another situation, but at this drama they spoil it additionally.
However, this does not spoil the overall impression of the film, which I was pleased with.",positive

"I would say Endgame is in the top 5 of all the MCU. It's cgi was brilliant and at times the story was beautiful. There are three things that I feel endgame didn't do well. Thor. Although ragnarok worked with the action comedy, I feel they went to far in endgame. It feels like they where almost mocking the character and at every turn you had no choice but to laugh at him. Thanos. How can thanos without the stones be so strong? I understood in Infinity wars his power but even with the stones he got crippled but storm breaker but suddenly in Endgame he's even stronger with Thor seemingly unable to use storm breaker in the same way. I feel the whole time travel although great to look back at 10+ years that brought us to endgame, there was no structure, it all felt messy. I love the MCU and I still rate the film. For me as this is my opinion, had they got these things right it would have been the best MCU film ever. Like I said had some beautiful moments within the story and that helps pull you through the movie.",positive
"To keep this short and sweet, Avengers Endgames is one of the most visually pleasing movies of the year next to Alita Battle Angel. But what stops short is the political messages driven into this movie. Socialist activist, people who cry over star wars trailers and folks who say the world will end in 12 years will love this movie and won't miss a beat. But for those who are more attune and aware of forced idealism in entertainment to push across a progressive narrative may find it overpowering and in your face a certain moments. Other aspects left me a little disappointed as well, but not enough to get up and leave the theatre. Also to eveeyone giving this ten stars. Check out their activity and user names. Someone is really trying to boost this movie.",positive

They do.
They are all human. A super kind human, with huge hearts.
At the end that is what I get.Both directors very well done bringing up a new thing, joining the heroic plot, whilst it is superhero movie we believed filled by tons of tough guys, and not anymore, every single one is vulnerable.Thank you everyone, in producing this movie. It is a bad news for any superhero movies coming up next, though. Both from MCU or DCEU. One heavy standard has been stamped.",positive
"After seeing endgame, I felt I had to let this out
It probably the best movie to date (and I'm not hyping)...it got it all -action, suspense, comedy, emotional...just about everything a movie can possibly have...keep in mind it's a superhero movie but it exceed its limit...it also the best MCU movie in my book and it far exceed Infinity War.
Maybe the most exciting and beautiful part of the movie came up about the last 40-30 minutes and it's the best thing I've ever see in Cinematic history.Overall, it a 10 out of 10 movie for me
I don't really have to recommend you go see it before you do...just avoid spoilers before seeing it.",positive

"As a stand alone movie Endgame was fine, but as the penultimate conclusion to a decade-long franchise I would say it was disappointing. Some of that has to do with the fact that they had to follow up Infinity War which was such a great movie, and some of it comes from already established issues with the MCU in general. One of my biggest gripes is that, once again, they are completely inconsistent with pretty much everything:They don't follow the original story lines much and the abilities of EVERY character wildly swings between movies. Somehow half of the Avengers were able to hold their own against Thanos when he had the gauntlet and 4 stones, but then later they fair poorly against Thanos without the gauntlet or stones. The same goes for the ""Children of Thanos"". They were a formidable force in Infinity War and were completely wasted in Endgame.They relegated the two most powerful Avengers to comic relief. Look, I liked Thor: Ragnarok. I'm sure most people did, the comedy was a breath of fresh air over how serious the franchise has been. But they way over did it in this film and even worse, the comedy points were not well placed.There are issues with the entire time travel plot. I'm not even going to go into the whole ""alternate timeline"" idea because I don't really understand it well and everyone else who is a theoretical physicist on IMDB already has. My issue with the plot is simply that they decided to bring back everyone and fight Thanos in the 5 years later timeline. There are many issues with un-snapping half the population of the universe 5 years later. First off, every single person on a plane or space ship when they disappeared is going to die. The same goes for the vast majority of people on boats like cruise ships or military vessels that suddenly find themselves in the middle of the ocean. But my biggest gripe here is that a sudden doubling of the population is going to have apocalyptic results across the galaxy. After 5 years every government or organization would have adapted their infrastructure to support the current population. And this would only apply to the governments that were able to ""thrive"" after the snap. As Black Widow said early in the film, most world governments are barely holding on. I sure hope Spiderman: Homecoming at least mentions the massive famine going on world wide.In the end it felt like the directors were too focused on paying homage to all the different versions of the Marvel comics that have run (no matter how short) and completely threw away a decade's worth of character and story development from the films.That's not to say that there weren't good aspects of the film. The CGI was fantastic and the acting from most of the characters was phenomenal. That definitely made up for a weak plot and poor pacing.So, yeah, not a great movie and not a hot pile of garbage. I just wish this review was about some middle of the series movie and not the final one.",positive
"Where to begin? All the callbacks and tie-ins to past MCU films are truly a celebration of the MCU. As always, the action is exciting(Although sparse) and humour cracks you up. This movie reaches a new level going into the third act, with epic moments that put a grin on your face and an ending that might just put a tear in your eye. A must watch!",positive
"Finally it's here. But not the finale we deserve. The story is quite thin, the action is scarce and the 3+ hours is too much. The humor saves the movie. Without humor it would have been a total disaster. This should have been the finale that would be epic. Looks like they where going for the quick money instead of waiting to perfect it. Sad to see it end like this.",positive

"This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it's still up there for one of their stronger movies. It's not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie",positive
"I had a blast watching this when it first came out, easily my favorite of the MCU films",positive
"The Russo Brothers prove themselves equal to their nigh insurmountable task in this expertly balanced centrepiece to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that both pays homage to the past eleven years of films and sends the universe in bold new directions. There is a weight of consequence to everything that happens but it never allows itself to become too morose or sombre without a sting of classic Marvel wit, and it harmonises this more grim tone with a level of glorious action hitherto undreamt of; bringing a number of intertwining story arcs we've followed and become invested in for years to the most satisfying of conclusions.",positive

Really.. I don't like the fact that iron man died and will never come after this. But it was good ending.,positive
"The beginning............is absolute genius. The opening scene draws you in emotionally and gives you the true hatred for Thanos that you need in order to watch this movie. The rest of the movie erases that. If you think about this plot critically, there is no reason for the ending to be the way that it is.For the average fan, this movie is incredible. Not only does every character get their shining moment, but every moment you want as a casual fan, a CASUAL fan, happens for the first 2hr 40mins. The last 21 minutes however are lackluster. There is a LOT of fan-servicing.This movie however, is filled with plot holes that any critically thinking fan can see and loathe about. Not only are key mechanics not explained with any clarity, but they completely defy literally any concept of them that the human race of today have theorized about. The Russos simply write what they want into the storyline to make things work in their favor and that is that.SPOILER-SPOILER:

Tony's funeral is completely glazed over. I almost teared up when Pepper said her goodbye. But how do you not show a ceremony for his body? A STATUE maybe? This is THE foundation of the MCU thus far, cinematically, and you give CAP the glory of standing up to Thanos' armies by himself in the end? The Russo brothers blindly idolize Cap as an invulnerable super-human who can take any blow and get back up. Give me a reason for this.Captain Marvel is a badass for 3 minutes of the movie, and back-handed the next.Not to mention the Thanos that they fight in the end is not the Thanos that we've grown to hate. The Thanos we've grown to hate has killed trillions. He dies. The Thanos we get has not *snapped* yet, but the Russo brothers need a severed head to serve to fanboys.Why return the stones afterwards? Not only are you releasing the stones into other timelines and allowing for those timelines to create the Thanos we hated in Infinity War, but you're allowing your own timeline to be affected like the one's you manipulated the stones from. Not to mention the fact that Loki taking the stone and escaping in 2013 while having Cap and Tony go back in time WITHIN that separate timeline messed up further timelines. Are we to believe that the Avenger's are justified in ruining other timelines in order to fix their own?Why can't Thor speak to his mother about future events if she already knows that Thor in Endgame is in fact from the future. She know of future events but doesn't know about her incoming death? The movie's own logic explained that conversing with people in other timelines could ruin that timeline, yet not affect your timeline's future. With that said, why not just have Thor inform his mother of her death? This would not affect his timeline but allow Thor in the other timeline to have a mother. UGHThis movie is good for casual fans. This movie is a sub-5 rating for critical-thinking individuals. I only give this a 6 for the Russo brothers successfully drawing my attention away from fat Thor in the end and instilling that heroes with unideal bodies can be super too.",positive
"Thanos original purpose was to give his bride The Dead itself, the half of universe´s lives, as wedding gift. The evolving thing was too sense as a goal for a mad cosmic being as Thanos, anyway none care about it. The old comics are covered with dust and oblivion.I couldn´t stand the Captain America having the power of lightning and masterfully using Mjolnir, like he was expend training all his life with it. Totally sickining. ""He is worthy"" well he just need it to throw it, and wield it, just like that.Hawkeye the forgoten advenger was in a crazy rol, who cares? Where were Adam Warlock and Magus and even more The Living Tribunal?Why name this movies ""Infinity war""? with the excuse of the alternate filmic universe, very powerful plots are crumbling, one after another.Maybe that happens when you expect that new things overcome the old ones, or even that match just a little.",negative
Man oh man what a movie ! cant believe im alive to witness this i cant say much cause that would spoil the movie if i did all im gonna say is that everyone is in a for a roller coaster of emotions and just plain epicness!

"The movie is everything you want it to be and more. I was never bored in a single moment. The best part of the movie is watching them work and how they fit so much into a 3 hour movie which u would not want to miss a minute of. The movie opens with a subtle reference to infinity to spark ur memory of what happened at the end. The end made all 22 movies worth the watch and sets up the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe perfectly. You will happy, excited, and sad throughout the film. Without one of the best Marvel movies and best theater experience.",positive

Totally worth a watch and it caps the series off well but it's pacing is a bit erratic for my tastes.It'll be interesting to see what comes in the new phases. I won't say more because this movie deserves to have none of the secrets spoiled.Go see it guys.,positive
"Let me tell you, i love the avengers, i really do. People all around me praise how good it was, and how my friends said that it was a masterpiece and deserved a 10/10. But me? I don't think so. I think personally, it is wat to shoved. Time travel? Really? it is not really a solution tbh, and oh, there are also too many plot holes. The pacing is also way too damn slow, and it can get boring, at least for me. The action is great, but it is mostly time travel stuff. It ain't linear, so it may confuse some of you, especially myself. I just like infinity war better. Straight to the point, full of action and emotions. One of the things that i like about this movie is the ending with captain America getting old, enjoying his life. Really nice touch ngl. but this movie is an epic conclusion nonetheless. I would personally recommend to any hero fans, but may not for some who does not want stuff like i just pointed out.",positive

"Just after watching the movie I wanted to write a bad review comparing this with another creatures of cinematography from different genres which I personaly prefer more, but then I thought - why should I be so biased to a certain category of movies, revised everything and understood that this picture is oustandingly well.
First, it logically continues where we left in the previous part, from which that movie is significantly different - overall mood seems to shift from seriousness and in some degree of sadness to more bright and hilarious composition.
Plot is not completely straightforward and persuades a viewer to continue watching. The really bad thing is that there were some moments which in case of applying a deep inspecting seems to be silly, but, one the other hand, it could be understood as providing a simplificated view on the story, something balancing between nice-captured one without a plot and one having a plot but without any beautiful scenes.
Surely, there are lots of computer graphics, but, though, there are too many realistic battle scenes as for me, and even as I can't say that image lacks beautiful scenes, I would increase quantity of colorful episodes.
As a result - the movie worth watching definetely, but make sure that you watched at least the previous movie - then you'll get much bigger outcome since these two strongly connected in the logical sense and tell a single story.",positive
Appallingly bad. Full of plot holes and convoluted action scenes. Maximalism for the sake of maximalism is not entertaining.,negative
I'm a huge marvel fan myself and I saw the film yesterday and I come out of the cinema utterly disappointed. The movie had good parts like the scene when Captain America had held of Thor's hammer and how they brought professor hulk and Tony's daughter into the movie.I think captain marvel should of had a bigger part she's only at the beginning and end and the hair cut should go. Thor I understand that he had lost everything his home people and family but fat Thor look ridiculous. Ant man should of had a better entrance he got brought back by a rat. I also think that Captain America should of had his death like the comics standing up to Thanos instead of going back the Peggy.Overall it was a good movie. I liked it but I thought that it wasn't all there but again I did like it.,positive
"What a well written final Avengers film. Bit of Captain Marvel early but it mostly focused on the original Avengers & Ant Man for the most part of the first half. Had the right amount of humour & Thor was really good in this one. The Black Widow/Hawkeye scene for the stone, I had no idea what way that was going to go. The hug between Tony & Peter had me choking up, a beautiful touch. The all female cast leading a fight scene was tremendous. Tony steps up for the ultimate sacrifice. Cap finally gets his dance. It was the perfect goodbye & they sign off at the start of the credits. A goodbye to most the originals. Done in a wonderful way that Marvel perfected.Also, No credit scene",positive
"I avoided seeing this movie for the longest time. I just watched it - Jan 3, 2021.I have to say they did a very nice job. Fitting in aspects from all previous movies nicely. Excellent acting from everyone. You could tell how many of these actors really clicked over the previous movies as the chemistry was really nice here.I was surprised how many emotional scenes there were. If you were a fan of the previous movies you will enjoy this.The ending battle scene is absolutely awesome. It's exactly the type of comic book grand finale/battle you would expect.A truly worthy ending to fantastic story.",positive
"End Game holds the same epic scale as Infinity War but with everything the first part lacked. This time around, the Russo's provide a more personal, character driven-tale filled with important character moments that I felt Infinity War severely lacked. As a result, despite the stakes being lower in this instalment, I was 10x more invested in the story and action and I truly worried for our heroes this time round.Our two main hero's, Cap and Tony, are definitely at their best here, despite their tensions from Civil war being brushed aside a little too quickly. The two actors are masters of these roles right now and all of their work pays off, with both characters seeing incredibly satisfying ends by the film's climax. Not to mention, other returning hero's also have satisfying, but admittedly controversial arcs, like Banner and Thor (who isn't as interesting as he was in Infinity war, but is still much better than the pre-Ragnarok rendition of the character).Because of the more personal story, the action feels less noisy and instead more tense and satisfying, with the final battle being by far the best that the series has offered.While Thanos takes a back seat in this film, he still remains menacing in his moments onscreen and an incredible motivator for our heroes that we've come to love over the years.Overall, End Game improves every weak aspect of Infinity War, and acts as a perfect conclusion to the Infinity saga.",positive
"First time you Watch it it's awesome, second time you watch it its good.",positive
"Excellent script, fantastic story, got to spend the right amount of time with the characters.",positive
"Like many reviewers are saying, this is a very satisfying ending to the Avengers series. Most Marvel fans will love it, but it's certainly not worth a full 10.It takes a while for the story to get going. At first the feeling of loss does make an impact, but it gets slow after a while.The plan to fetch the infinity stones from the past is not very well executed, and the groups get back too quickly. But then there's the final battle, and that looks amazing! Good to see everybody back.The role of captain Marvel is disappointing to say the least. She seemed so powerful in her own movie, but here Thanos easily beats her.Captain America does get his happy ending with Peggy Carter, and I can see why actor Chris Evans wants to quit playing him. There's really nothing to tell about the captain anymore...Overall the movie is packed with lots of fun and also some really emotional moments. The CGI is top-notch, as can be expected from Marvel. The movie is entertaining and I want to see it again, just not right away. Go see it, you will not be disappointed. Just don't expect to have your mind blown...",positive
"It's hard to admit that there will be a superhero movie among the top 10 in 2019. Tragic, epic, affectionate, these words, which did not exist in Marvel's dictionary, can be shown in this final chapter. For passers-by, this is a business masterpiece with self consistent logic, orderly rhythm and proper arrangement. For fans, this is a youth farewell ceremony with supreme feelings.",positive
"I really do understand why it should have some emotional sides in this movie but I really don't understand why did they decide to put too much. It was way too much and made it boring especially in the first half of the movie.Ruined the last movie logic in some ways. First of all, in the last Avengers movie, at the last scene, Captain Marvel was called. Why did they put this scene in the last movie if they decided to give her the least role? It made no sense. The tension in the last movie was balanced but in Endgame there was no balance. One scene doesn't fit second one as it started losing it's consistency.Alright, it's not the worst Avengers movie but way worse than the last one. Is there any explanation of all those scientific stuff they made up? If you want to make a good movie of superheroes, I guess you should not use pseudoscience or very weak scientific arguements. They shouldn't mention those scientific arguements in the movie. It would be better without those weird explanations. If there were cuts around 1.5 hours of movie, it would easily get over 7 points from me but I felt like this movie took my time without any sense.Cheap tricks... I wonder why they used time travel idea in this movie and why did they say Black Widow had faced permanent death while Gamora had return from another time. Why did infinity stones didn't remain after Thanos used them to kill half of the livings but after Hulk revived all the dead people and Iron Man used them to kill all the enemies. This was very unclear.",positive
"This movie was bad for anyone who is not a paid Disney reviewer, a teenager or an adult who hasn't grown out of their teenage fanboy stage. There are too many scenes of unfunny one-liners right in the middle of people dying that it is a slough to sit through. The powers that people can do either changes or are forgotten between scenes. Even the action is so spread out with most of the movie being geeky time-travel talk. When the action does appear, it is edited so hard it makes it difficult to know (or care) what happens.If you just looking for a popcorn non-thinking, background while I do dishes movie, maybe this works. Any adult with an adult brain that likes movies to make sense of have some semblance of logic....pass.",negative

"This is a highly anticipated movie. Many have speculated about what is to come. But many were wrong. Many people had theories that this movie would include time travel or parallel universes, and they claimed it may be too confusing for viewers. I personally did not find the story line confusing. It was set at a good pace. If you watched all of the preceding movies leading up to Endgame, then any of the story line in this movie will not be confusing.Avengers: Infinity War left me asking a lot of questions. I wanted to know more about Thanos. I wanted to know what truly happened to the heroes and people who were dusted. I wanted to know why Hulk was so afraid of Thanos instead of becoming angrier and stronger.Avengers: Endgame was not the traditional Marvel movie where the plot line is so predictable. There was true emotional connection among me, the viewer, and the heroes who survived the snap. Each hero was suffering in his or her own way, and they were suffering collectively.Thanos was more of a dynamic character ere. He did not have the power of any of the Infinity Stones so he had to use his brute strength in battle. He was ridiculous strong and shockingly a highly talented fighter. He was ruthless in his methods. On the contrary, the Black Order were irrelevant and pointless. All four of them were so weak and useless. I was disappointed that there was not any development for them.I felt most bad for Thor. Let me just say he is one of my favorites in The Avengers. In Infinity War, he was the one who lost most directly from Thanos. Thor's brother and best friend (Loki and Heimdall) were both brutally murdered at the hands of Thanos while Thor was helpless. He went on his mission to forge Stormbreaker; this weapon was strong enough to defeat and kill Thanos even if he had all six Infinity Stones. Thor was incredibly strong with his new axe, and he was so close to defeating Thanos. But he ""should have gone for the head"". Snap! Thor was so depressed in Endgame. He felt most responsible for all of the people and living creatures that died from the snap. He was so depressed, that he became a drunk throughout the movie, and he was afraid to face Thanos again. This was hard to watch because Thor would never back down from a fight; he had no fears.Captain America has always been my favorite in all of Marvel. He is always grounded and focused. He is always willing to do the right thing even when the price is high. He remained a good man. Watching him go head to head with Thanos was a treat! When it seemed like he was going to fail, the impossible happened. Captain America was worthy to possess the power of Thor! Yes, he was able to use Mjolnir! He was so powerful and awesome with it and his classic round shield. It made Thanos so mad that that was where he swore he would burn the entire planet down and summoned his entire army on Earth.
Whatever it takes was the underlying theme of this movie. Each Avenger lost someone and something from Thanos' snap. Each now knew it whatever it takes is the only way to defeat Thanos for good. It was really sad to see some of the Avengers make that ultimate sacrifice; however, it was the best way for Marvel to end this story, and it was truly poetic justice.Thank you to Marvel for putting together such a miraculous movie.""Avengers, Assemble!""",positive
"Without doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. I was completely gripped from the beginning. Fantastic performances by all of the cast (not that we'd expect any less), I find it hard to pick a favourite character because they're all so awesome, in this film more so than ever. I was on the edge of my seat throughout all of the action sequences, and have known few films to evoke such intense feelings of hope, and also great sadness/ loss. The humour throughout the film is spot on, and in one of the most important final scenes you could have heard a pin drop in the cinema, it was like everybody was holding their breath - staring at the screen in complete disbelief. As far as I can tell, no one saw that coming which is a credit to the writers and directors who were able to piece everything together so cleverly. It's an absolute masterpiece. Just one warning, though - if you're anything like me you'll need to go armed with tissues.",positive
"Avengers Endgame is a perfect farewell packed with emotions and grandeur, Must watch for Marvel Fans...",positive
It was alright. Lots of plotholes and not much action.,positive
"Avengers: Endgame is probably the most hyped and the most anticipated release of 2019. Marvel's Avengers that has continued to entertain and wow us for so many years has finally come to a conclusion that has all the World held in its thrall.In the previous movie, Avengers: Infinity War, we saw Thanos erasing half the population including many of our favorite Avengers from the planet and in this film, the world is still trying to grapple with the loss. I will not reveal the plot but suffice to say that the story while a bit slow in the first half had me glued to my seat throughout. The twists and turns are so well planned that nowhere did they seem predictable and lest you breathe or break concentration, you will find yourself missing the many memorable moments in Avengers: Endgame.Everyone right from the Avengers to the supporting characters from previous movies of the Avengers franchise make an appearance here and what an appearance it is! You will feel like reuniting with family after many years of separation and left with a heart full of a myriad of emotions- happiness at meeting them again, sadness at knowing that this will be the last time we meet them and satisfaction that many of our beloved characters get their happily-ever-after.Avengers: Endgame is a movie well planned and expertly executed. The joy of having all my beloved heroes and heroines at one place is beyond words and the feeling of loss knowing I will never see them again together is heart-wrenchingly real. Stan Lee's last cameo of his life and the last in an Avenger's movie was so beautiful that it brought a smile to my face as well as sadness to my heart.I stayed off social media lest I accidentally read a spoiler until I watched the movie!
A movie that not only wraps up the Avengers chapter beautifully but also justifies each second of the three hour-long story, Njkinny recommends Avengers: Endgame to everyone. Go watch with friends, family or alone. Don't miss out on the unforgettable feeling of seeing an exceptional saga of heroism, friendship, love, and sacrifice come to a memorable conclusion in this film.Super shiny 5 stars to it from me and this is a movie that I can watch again.",positive
"There are two things that MCU got absolutely right in Endgame, it's marketing and the number of superheroes in the movie. Otherwise, it's a predictable, mediocre and just any other movie, made only for the fans with a lot of efforts. And I would definitely rate it lesser than Infinity War and Civil War.Instead of making huge debate, I'll just prove my point in bullets below:-They ruined Thor for everyone, he's just a comedy gimmick from now on.
-After watching A4, I believe the Infinity war should have ended at killing Thanos at his 'Garden' with Avengers losing 'absolutely all hopes'. That starting in A4 seemed pretty forced and misplaced to me, rather it should have started after 5 years.
-The whole idea of original avenger's stories coming to conclusion seems very forced especially Captain remaining behind in past.
-Natasha and Clint's so called emotional sequence where she dies, is one of the lowest point of the movie.
-Lets not even talk about Time Travel, I believe it was the easiest way they could write this movie. It seems very non sensical.
-Movie seemed burdened with its own weight of being emotional comedy yet action packed. At points you'll feel that it's unnecessary and even not that funny.
-One of the biggest flaw is that it's only made for fans, unlike previous 3 avengers. There are far too many references, that only fans will understand. As few critics put it, a fan service. Having said that, if you're a fan, you'll love it like hell.
-The final battle is the selling point, that's what all fans wanted to see.
-They did exactly what I was afraid of, undo the snap. Which translates to undo the previous movie. That's not something they should have done, again a lazy script.
-As engaging as IW was because of its plot, this one is only engaging for it's one liners. Again, that too only for fans because you won't enjoy if you haven't seen previous ones.It's a good movie, but unfortunately doesn't live up to the quality of Infinity War. That's just sad.",positive
"As the only, UNIQUE, AND BIGGEST REAL FAN OF MARVEL, who loved every sigle movie, character, and comic from them, I have to give this movie a 1/10, so maybe they could delete it and make it again, but RIGHT this time... and let's pretend ENDGAME NEVER EXISTED...COME ON! BAN RUSSO'S BROTHERS FROM HOLLYWOOD FOREVER!! PLEASE!! DONT MAKE THEM DIRECT MORE MOVIES! THEY RUINED IT! the writers gave them a GOLDEN script, and Russo's TURNED IT INTO DUST! they ruined it totally!! where was vision??? hulk??? anyone??? cap lifting thor hammer?? really?? that's not any surprise, that's OBVIOUS! cap was even more worth than thor since the beginning!!!!! HULK should have lifted the hammer, that would have been epic!! and a surprise! but, where was him?? he didnt even fight... the strongest and original avenger... and he didn't even show up end in the last 2 movies of this era.... NO, NO AND NO! I should give these guys a lesson of how to write, produce and direct a movie, HUGE MISTAKES that even a 5 years old kid would have avoided!",negative
"THIS MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC!!!!
only sad parts are when people die",positive
"After almost 48 hours of story Endgame is the epic fitting end the MCU deserved for the Infinity Saga. As someone who was never a fan of comics growing up, and only saw the first Iron Man movie as part of a work function, I have come to await every installment eagerly and this one most of all. It didn't disappoint and the non stop story made 3 hours feel like 1.5.",positive
"I cried. I laughed. I was shocked. My expectations were blown away. Perfection, enough Said.",positive
"What an end to an epic series. A roller coaster of action, humour and emotions.",positive
"A story that Russo brothers started 10 years back came to an end.The fictional characters made sure they remain with us till last breath.
Goodbye hurts no matter how beautiful it is and ofcourse not watching AVENGERS ASSEMBLE in future will even hurt more.Thats how impactful it was, even if you haven't watched any marvel movie watch them watch them all and witness the magic of how a 180+ minute movie binds you with emotions,actions and of course never ending love towards our superheros.
Kudos.............",positive
"Yesterday, I watched ""Avengers: Endgame"", and it's a great conclusion to the ""Infinity War"", and the most dramatic of the Avengers films. It was also surprising that a previous film, ""Ant-man and the Wasp"", although underwhelming, potentially kickstarted the vital plot of ""Endgame"".Due to failed attempts to reverse the damages Thanos had caused, we see the likes of Iron Man losing his confidence, to the point of even shutting down ideas that could actually work (time-traveling in this case), and Thor eating and drinking himself into depression in ""New Asguard"" while playing ""Fortnite"". On the other hand, others like Black Widow were going around looking for Hawkeye, who was still angry over losing his entire family to Thanos' snap five years ago.Then, Ant-man, having been trapped in the Quantum Realm for 5 years, which felt like a few minutes there, after coming to reality of what had happened during said 5 years, realized that one could weaponize the Quantum Realm to reverse Thanos' deed. This ends up being the main plot of ""Endgame"", as the goal of the surviving Avengers is to time-travel to various events of past Avengers and related films, and steal all ten Infinity Stones before Thanos could get them. They have to return the stones though, or else, according to the Ancient One, they could cause undesirable branches within the timeline, with Bruce Bender/Hulk (Bruce and Hulk are somehow fused together at this time-line) promising not letting such branch to happen.In short: I liked the time-traveling mission, and how Thanos of 9 years ago through his Nebula managed to see the future through present-day Nebula, to the point of spying on the present-day Avengers, and launching an attack on their base after their mission. This paves the way to the climax, where the Avengers have to fight Thanos once again.Before the attack, Bruce manages to use the Infinity Stones to bring back the fallen, who, half-way through the fight, with the help from Doctor Strange, join the battle again Thanos and his army. Obviously real-life, with heavy mix of CGI scenes, I liked how epic and urgent the battle ultimately felt on screen.As a bigger spoiler, a handful of Avengers and Marvel characters never come back.For starter, it looked like Thanos destroyed Vision for good while obtaining an Infinity Stone from his forehead in ""Infinity War"".As we already know, Camora was sacrificed in ""Infinity War"" in order for Thanos to obtain an Infinity Stone. We never saw her since seeing her younger self at the end of ""Infinity War"", despite being on the same planet as where the Avengers found Thanos on in ""Endgame"". Maybe ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3"" might address this?In ""Endgame"", the same thing happens to Black Widow while she and Hawkeye were fighting each other for the right to jump off the cliff... in order for the survivor to walk away with an Infinity Stone.Since they're naturally radioactive, using the Infinity Stones nearly killed Thanos, as he explains at the beginning, with obvious injury on the side of his face. This causes Bruce to voluntarily use it on himself to bring the fallen back to life. But, in the climax, Tony (i.e Iron Man) urgently steals them back from Thanos, and uses them to end Thanos and his army. Tony is not as lucky as Bruce, and dies from his resulted injury.From the resolution, the price being paid to bring the fallen back to life, and restore peace and order to the world, is realized, as the characters gather to mourn Tony at his residence. How the film ends, with Thor vacating his throne to fly to space with the Guardians of the Galaxy, really marks the end of an era for the current version of the Avengers. In short, I'd describe it as being ""bitter sweet"".But, that's not to say that the film is without demerits.The biggest issue is the time-traveling itself. The Avengers say to each other that changing the past won't necessarily change the future, as long as they don't do things that include meeting up with their past selves. That happens three times: Captain America, and Nebula interacting with, and even fatally shooting, her past self. Even Quill, in the process of finding that purple Infinity Stone, gets knocked out by War Machine, potentially causing the events of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" not to happen. (Remember, in that film, Ronan's men were simultaneously looking for that Infinity Stone.)In the resolution, Steve (i.e Captain America) time-travels to return the Infinity Stones back to their original spots, but is then revealed to have purposely returned to his original time to settle down with his old crush. This could potentially alter events and people till the present day. Many had even pointed out that Steve forgot all about Bulky. Let's say that he somehow found and reunited with Bulky in the past. In that case, the movie never addresses that. (He did hand his shield over to its new owner: Falcon.)And finally, with help from Doctor Strange, the characters affected by Thanos return, but they apparently never aged, making them 5 years younger than they're supposed to be presently.As a YouTuber, ""Somecallmejohnny"", said during his Sonic 06 review regarding Shadow: ""Why time-travel? That's almost never a good plot device! If it's done incorrectly, which is very easy to do, s*** like this can happen!""And also, the guys at Marvel Studio promised that Captain Marvel was going to be a huge part of the film. That honor goes to Iron Man as explained earlier, and even Ant-man weaponizing the Quantum Realm. Captain Marvel only ends up giving air support.In short: It is a great, but bitter sweet, way to end the saga of ""Infinity War"", even the whole of ""Avengers"", as the credits show the name of the casts with their signatures, but no secret scenes. Just, don't expect this film to be 100% perfect all the way.",positive
Fascinated to see all the super heroes..but more surprises and high moments were expected,positive
It is truly the best movie ever.. I cried my eyes out.. I think we got attached to it in a way we couldn't imagine.. Great experience and a must.. Thanks marvel for this perfect masterpiece,positive
"Mediocre
Revamp of old stuff, waste of time, okay ending.",positive
"I just don't get it. I tried to like this vacuous American drivel, but just can't. The whole thing is a stupid train wreck of nonsensical characters. hammy acting, loud thuds, baloney quasi-science and space effects. Just act well, have a worthwhile narrative, but no.Glinty effect hard on the eye visuals, like you just ate a kilogram of gummy bears, and now nature wants revenge. The acting is the worst, good actors that are aware of the camera and crew, so actually direction fail. Make a some cringe joke to try to distract.Just listen to the dialogue: I know, we'll use ether to time travel to go back in time to Asguard on board the muppet ship to get to the Smurf nano-crystals from Dr Oddface. Or something like that.Individually a character like Spiderman is fine, but with a Norse God and a talking chipmunk? It's like having a 'bonus' Hawaiian pizza. Not only do you get pineapple but you get chocolate and anchovies because more 'must' simply be better?Save it for a long haul flight or download it to your phone so you can watch it when you're on the throne. Well possibly your cell phone game might be more fun. If your IQ is under 70 or you are under 14 you might like it. Avoid the 3D version unless you like migraines and blurred vision, the gimmick that just won't die.",negative
"In life, I believe there is VERY LITTLE things that are either NEAR perfection or ARE perfection....Tonight, I witnessed perfection.
Avengers: Endgame is simply so UNBELIEVABLE, AMAZING and down right PERFECT.If I could give a strong firm handshake to each individual who worked on that movie, I would.They did it.
They have made something that is so PERFECT that I may start questioning my own reality on how something could be so good.Watch Endgame.
You will experience MANY things throughout the movie....But....Regret will NOT be one of them....",positive
"Avengers: Endgame was simply superhero perfection that was so worth all those Marvel movies. The storylines and action didn't disappoint at all that it had me at the edge of my seat every single second. Avengers: Endgame is not only a movie that Marvel fans should be proud of but it is one that Stan Lee would be damn proud of, no doubt. Simply amazing movie from Marvel.",positive
This movie has done anything better like What Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 did. A perfect movie that has a perfect ending.,positive
I loved this movie even though I decided to give only 8/10. The ending was very sad and perfect for the Avenger series.,positive
Robert Downey JR needs an Oscar. Fantastic performance,positive
"That began roughly a decade ago. Avengers: Endgame is a fantastic love letter to fans of the MCU that brings more heart and fan service to the table, and maybe even a more satisfying ending, though I must admit that I got choked up a few times (didn't cry though, just barely). It's such a great close to several chapters in the MCU.
As far as criticism goes. The only little drawbacks were that it doesn't quite match Infinity War's shock value and mind boggling action and that the movie's sci-fi plot device created some logical plot holes. I'll oeavitnatnthat, because I'm not posting spoilers and on balances I thought Endgame was awesome.",positive
"First 2 hours are kind of dull. I was expecting more frankly. Reckon it's predictable as well, the last hour was entertaining though.",positive
"OH MY GOD ARE THERE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE YET, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW.Also, I'm baaaaack! Sorry I was absent for quite a while. Also, this review is extremely late; I was planning on making an Endgame review for quite a while, but now I'm doing it! YAY!!!!So this is it. This is the big one. The ultimate conclusion. Avengers: Endgame. TONS AND TONS of hype was built up for this movie, and it's probably the biggest movie of all time even. But with all that said, is it any good? You better believe it. This might actually be the greatest superhero movie of all time, even better than Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Logan, and The Dark Knight. If you can top The Dark Knight, then you're an extremely powerful sorcerer.What's the story? After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos's actions and restore balance to the universe.Alright. What am I supposed to say about this movie that hasn't been said by literally everyone yet? Well, let's talk about the fight scene first: I think it is the greatest moment in cinema history. Now, I know what you're all thinking: ""REALLY? THAT'S THE GREATEST MOMENT IN CINEMA HISTORY? WHAT KIND OF LOW STANDARDS DO YOU HAVE?"" Well, I am an ENORMOUS fan of the MCU, and I'm not a master critic, so please bear with me! I feel like that scene is just sooooooo amazing because we see all of the Avengers together and trying to destroy Thanos and his army, and it's just so beautiful. Once Cap whispers ""assemble"", everything is just so amazing- actually, saying it's amazing is an understatement. Almost EVERY character from the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in it, and they're just doing what they do best: being awesome and murdering everything. Even the Thanos snap victims walk through a bunch of portals and arrive, and when I saw it opening morning (yeah, I managed to get tickets for OPENING DAY), the audience went WILD. What accompanies this mind-blowing fight is the insanely heroic and powerful score by Alan Silvestri (my favorite film composer of all time) that REALLY emphasizes how big it is, but that's not all! The end of this scene made me CRY. Yeah, a lot of movies don't make me cry, but this one DOES. So after Tony Stark snaps his fingers on the new Infinity Gauntlet and delivers his instant classic line, ""I am Iron Man"", he dies. The reason why this scene is so emotionally affective is not only the buildup to the scene, but the fact that Tony Stark was the man who started it all. Don't argue Carol Danvers because it took her 21 movies to actually be in the MCU. The funeral didn't help either. But anyways, another really sad scene in the movie is the Soul Stone Sacrifice scene where Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff dies as well. This wasn't as affective as the Tony Stark death scene, but it was still emotionally powerful because the buildup was, once again, properly dramatic. You can tell Clint didn't want her to die, and they kept fighting until Natasha finally decided to sacrifice herself. ""It was supposed to be me,"" Clint says in a future scene of the movie. The only actual flaw in the movie is that it feels kinda slow-paced, but that was probably the intention of the film to make it more serious and dramatic compared to most of the other MCU movies. The real hero of the movie, however, is the rat that saved Ant-Man from the Quantum Realm. The rat deserves all of the attention. I also like how they went back in time to get all of the Infinity Stones and added their more comical spin on the previous MCU movies (that is, until the Soul Stone scene). One more thing I'd like to mention is that Captain America/Steve Rogers goes back in time at the end of the movie to restore the Infinity Stones, but ends up old in the future and gives Falcon his shield, proving that Falcon is gonna be the next Captain America!!!! Meanwhile, Steve decided to go back in time to be with Peggy Carter (he found her in an earlier time-travel scene), and I feel like that's the ultimate part of emotion in the movie. Just... the ending is awesome and so is the rest of the movie!!!!!In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is a fantastic movie filled with tons and tons of answers after what happened in Avengers: Infinity War and even more really engaging things that make it really good as a standalone movie. If you like Marvel, you'll LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this movie!!!!!! The ending is so mind-blowing and the rest of the movie is really good, and that FINAL BATTLE!!!! Even the TITLE CARD emphasizes how awesome the movie is by playing a powerful and heroic version of the Avengers theme. One more thing: you know how I said The Dark Knight was my favorite movie of all time? Well, now it's this. Avengers: Endgame. TOO MUCH YES. I can't wait for Phase 4 of the MCU!!!! Right up there with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 as just some of the BEST franchise endings ever.Funny thing: I went this ENTIRE review without mentioning Stan Lee's final cameo. Personally, it's not one of his BEST cameos, but it's still a funny cameo. God, I miss Stan Lee... he was awesome. Things are never gonna be the same without his cameos...",positive
"I hoped for more. It was very well done, acting and special affects but storylines were hard to keep straight. A true fan may need to watch it several times to pull things together. Didnt like what they did to Thor at all! Loved the new Hulk though! So incredibly heartbroken that Stark lost his life. So now what? End of the Avengers movies? Hmm!",positive
I go to the cinema expecting something more amazing than Infinity War. I did not get that. This film was wack. Utter crap. Lazy lazy lazy. I go to the cinema and always turn off my phone. I reached over to the empty seat beside me and took my phone out from my inside jacket pocket. That has never happened to me before. Not ever. How can this be the sequel to IW? One scene had all the women jump into battle at the same time. What woke bs is this? That scene was pure cringe. And laughably bad. My actual rating is minus 1.,negative
"This film gives us something that the comics had but the films lacked: the ""Smart Hulk"".It's unfortunate that this new development with the character came about in the last film of the Avengers series, this is something that should've happened in one of the two hulk films. But I'm glad it finally happened here.In fact I'm very impressed with the way the CGI was done for the character here, he looks very real. They've improved motion capture to the point where the actor themselves can provide the model for the CGI's movements. This goes all the way back to Gollum from lord of the rings, Who was also played but Andy Serkis, who played Ulysses Klaue in this franchise.These avengers films have been basically about one catastrophe after another, in the first film New York City was trashed. In the second, some small city/state called Sokovia was utterly destroyed. In infinity war, the destruction is brought to Wakanda. And in this film, it's the avengers own base that is leveled.But the amazing thing is that this film ties together, I lost count how many films is there? Three Iron Man films, three previous avengers films, Black panther, three Thor films. That's 10 so far, and then 11 if you want to include the Incredible Hulk, which was slightly outside canon for this franchise. None of the X-Men films tied into this so those can't be counted. What am I missing? Oh, two Spiderman films so far bringing it up to 13. And then Captain Marvel, 14. I am sure I am forgetting something. And then appearances within Agents of SHIELD, by Sif, Fury, Hill. Oh yes, two Guardians of the Galaxies, 16.Nothing like this has ever been done and the amount of work that went into this elongated tale has been unprecedented.And there are even more films related to the stories coming out soon.What I love about these films is that they are exactly like the marvel crossovers that I have read, complex Iron Man, Avengers, they even had West Coast Avengers for a while, which became Force Works.There are so many great stories in marvel comics that can be mind for future films. But it's just that we've never had a cast like this, involving all of the marvel titles.I'm just very sad that they could not get the X-Men involved with this because I know they were part of the story too. But they did get Spiderman in there because the actor begged Sony to do it and they listened. Which was amazing.",positive
"Endgame is a movie surrounded with mountains of hype, but it lives up to it in ways you wouldn't expect. I will not say it is the most action packed film out there, nor was it destined to be, but it is surely the most emotional Marvel movie created.Plot- If you have seen Infinity War, you know that whatever the plot may be is almost a surprise. The writers could have made it easier on the Avengers, but they didn't, thus resulting in a highly entertaining experience in which you must accept the fact that the solution is mostly unbelievable. But this is a Marvel movie we are speaking of. Any realistic criticism should be set aside for movies based on reality.Writing- Marvel got it down beautifully. The way they portray characters in a new light, the way they nail those corny one-liners, the way they interlock the storylines is so amazing yet nothing far from simplistic. They didnt have to go far, they just needed a duration in which they could fulfill each characters destiny. And it is not a rushed process; there is a reason this film is 3 hours.Plot- This movie takes on a plot nobody expected. When it displayed a time lapse, I was shocked yet thrilled. There is a reason they didn't spoil much in the trailer.Characters- Nobody is cut short here. Although it is a long film, not one important character is left shorthanded. Maybe some are, but if so, they are left totally open eneded for another film. I cannot spoil this but I will say a major Marvel hero will definitely make another appearance in the upcoming film in phase 5. We obviously know about Guardians 3 and Spiderman: Homecoming, so I will not reveal who will be most prevalent.Writing- The writing is downright awesome, probably some of the best that they've done. We have characters that bend out of form, hilarity that actuallly has perfect timing, as well as emotion unlike no other Marvel film. For me, ""Logan"" had alot of emotional weight, and this was similar, although they pertain to alternating Marvel Universes. The humour is on point. Never a missed beat.Characters/Acting- For me, I always think about the contrast between actor and character. I feel like, just as most Marvel movies containing the same characters, that they were uber successful. You feel for these characters- maybe not as much as you would observing them from the start, but they are true to form. Who else would have played these mighty beings?Quality- Endgame is no joke. It's not a cash-in kind of buy, these people knew what their fans deserved. The editing is prime, the filming is loose yet focused, the sound is perfect, the animation is mind blowing- observe how they make Michael Douglas appear 40 years younger- and the sequencing is phenomenal.Overall. Endgame does what most logical people want, as well as what most kids don't expect- emotional justification. It's reality. It takes about an hour or so to truly kick in the full-on action, but when you're a fan of the series, you truly understand. It's more about the intensity. The action is delivered at a high caliber, but this story is primarily about the power struggle between humanity and the unknown. Truly amazing.",positive
"WOW!!!
End Game, that film blew me away,
It's truly a MASTERPIECE of cinema & not just of the comic book world, i was amazed at how beautiful & devastating this movie was & how deeply it affected me!!!
Everything came together perfectly to create something really special & powerful, that much talent & characters all come together in a beautifully touching way it really is a technical masterpiece of filmmaking!!!I'm massively into the ""Avengers"" movies but not so much all the characters own films as there's so many, but the ones i have seen have all been excellent, Captain America & Hawkeye are my favourite characters of the Avengers team & I've loved all the Avengers films right upto ""End Game"" & then just WOW!!!This is a very dark & apocalyptic fantasy Thriller, all the stakes are higher & the atmosphere is of sadness & loneliness, Clint aka Hawkeye really feels like the heart of this particular Avengers film as we see him as the ordinary & loving Family man who loses his family & becomes a dangerous vigilante, Hawkeye uses his skills to hunt & kill criminals & you feel his sadness,his anger & his despair & Jeremy Renner gives the best performance so far as the troubled Hawkeye, it's a dark path for a complex character & that's just the start of End Game.
The Awesome underrated Renner steals the show from the epic suspenseful opening back as Hawkeye, please give this guy his own movie!!! Renner doesn't get the recognition he deserves for his role as Hawkeye, his scenes are always favourite & he packs so much intensity into his part, best Avenger.
Captain America is the main big beating heart behind all this darkness & Chris Evans gives his most powerful performance so far as cap, Black Widow has some extremely dark & emotional moments & Tony Stark shows why he's such an important Avenger as well as the smartest!!! Heroes rise & Heroes fall.All the characters are fantastic here in End Game, each character is given more depth,drama & emotion so you really care for this team.
The apocalyptic world is very eerie with half the people missing, it's creepy & lonely looking, the atmosphere is dark & gloomy & our heroes need to change this world.
End Game still has hilarious moments scattered throughout it's huge running time as it does with the amount of emotional drama & action packed scenes, there's never a dull or boring moment i thought as i totally got into this dark new world created by the evil ""Thanos""
The Action is breathtakingly Awesome & the c.g.i fx are Outstanding to the highest quality with it's massive budget put to full use, this is an epic film in every way!!!
The visual look is stunning!!!
By the End i was an emotional wreck as the characters touched my heart & the action put on screen blew me away, this is the best Avengers movie it's also the ultimate Comic book movie & an instant CLASSIC.Just watch it & laugh & cry at a MASTERPIECE of cinema.
When it ended i felt a big sense of loss,sadness & Happiness & that's how this masterpiece grabs you by the heart!!!
Excellent but my personal favourite Avengers film is still ""Age Of Ultron""",positive
"The MCU has meant quite a lot to me over the years, this is the franchise the more than any other shaped me into the film nerd that I am today and in many ways is the reason I do this at all. I still have my Iron Man poster that I bought in the cinema in 2008, just before my 7th birthday, back when I had no idea what an expanded universe was and a film as ambitious as this was just a pipe-dream for Kevin Feige.With that being said it shouldn't too difficult to see how reviewing this film is pretty difficult for me. At the time of writing I have seen the movie once so here are my initial reactions, I'll try to stay spoiler free but if you want to go in blind I recommend avoiding all reviews.This film is a complete mess, but in a good way. I can't think of a more fitting conclusion to this era of the MCU than to just mash all of the plot points together and just see what happens. At this point the MCU feels like a 90s comic run where to appreciate the grand narrative and subtle character moments you have to have read every previous issue plus all of the spin off issues about each individual character until you just give up entirely reread Watchmen. If you have ever successfully kept up with a comic like that then you know how satisfying it feels to read the issue where all of the character end up in the same place and fight the bad guy as a team. That is the feeling that Endgame gave me, satisfaction.This is a movie for fans, not for film critics, thats is why I am so lost for words on this one. I would be lying to say that certain scenes didnt make me choke up a little and other didnt make me smile uncontrollably having had 11 years of context pay off in very entertaining ways. That being said the film lover in me has to point out the issues in the Russos directing style which comes to haunt much of this film, The Russo brother have too modes: funny and depressing. This works perfectly on Community with the episodes directed by them being some of the best sitcom episodes of all time (dont believe me watch the A Fistful of Paintballs / For a Few Paintballs More two parter). Here it can be jarring with hard cuts between scenes that are dark and grimy looking were the actors get to show of their dramatic skills to bright, lighthearted scenes of physical comedy and one-lines. Occasionally the writers slip in some great character moments into the more comedic scenes but if you already dont like Marvel humor then you might start to feel that run-time.Those are really the only observations I feel comfortable giving this early without having seen the movie again or allowing time for others to see it. I think that the issues with tone will matter to me less once I see it again but it still needs addressed.Really it should come as no surprise to you that I would say you should see this film and dont take my rating as gospel here (or ever) as I will probably change my mind on it later.",positive
This is the big one and the movie knows it. The overall plot was nothing surprising. I figured that the remaining Avengers would somehow have to use the Infinity stones to bring back all that died and there would be some sort of battle with Thanos. I was not expecting Thanos to die so early in the beginning and that massive time jump of 5 years. I figured there would be some time in between films but not that long. I liked the whole plot of them going back in time to retrieve the time stones from various points in times and to see those movies again but from different points of view. It was interesting to see Ant-Man play such a prominent role in this movie. He was like Dr. Strange in that he had a siginificant role in the film. The deaths were somewhat shocking. I was surprised we saw the end of Black Widow and Tony Stark. There was alot of humour in this movie as well and seeing Thor be pretty much the Big Lebowski was hysterical. When we finally see everyone on screen together for the final battle was just a crowd pleaser and great to see. Overall a great film,positive
"Avengers: Endgame is a superb wrap-up of 11 years of movies in the MCU. And its the type of movie, you will not forget seeing in a crowded theatre. The spectacle is amazing, the acting is amazing, the storylines are great and the emotional punch at the end is one for the ages.Avengers: Endgame lives up to the hype on all accounts. And it will be hard for any future Avengers movie to beat it in terms of pure spectacle and emotional payoff. This movie, just like the previous Avengers movie, is superhero cinema at its finest.",positive
"Although this is the usual Avengers fare it comes nowhere near the quality of the previous MCU outings. There are just too many characters in it. Hardly anybody gets a chance to develop. As much as I enjoyed other MCU movies, this one just felt like a bit of a chore. And the final half hour was just grindingly hard work as the camera worked its way through so many Marvel characters, that I wouldn't have been surprised to see all the X-Men, Daredevil, Jessica Jones and the full cast of the Beano thrown in for good measure.
But it's still watchable - just.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is without a doubt the best Marvel film ever, and my favorite film I've ever seen!!! Amazing from start to finish. Had a very emotional beginning and picks off from there. The actors were all amazing. I loved how unexpecting it was! It was a very beautiful, emotional, and satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga. It ended the character's story in a marvelous way, and I wouldn't have changed anything about it. This movie does not disappoint!!! Thank you Marvel for making this masterpiece a reality!!!",positive
"You remember, when kids, how cool it was when Bruce Banner got mad and became hulk without control? How cool the old spiderman movies were (tobey mcguire as actor)? Superhero movies have become franchising for kids, making them more funny than how they were before and they just feel different. I can really see that they are targeting little kids. These movies are NOT anymore for older people too.This movie was most of the time trying to be funny, sometime being, but the superhero part was just not feeling like it made me feel years ago (even the first avenger movie was cool). That feeling of ""Omg, wow, this gavee me goosebumps"" is gone with Marvel's movies.
Hulk that became rational and not anymore the violent Irrational beast? Thor fat and drunk? Other characters just boring. Superheroes movies don't feel like it anymore. They are cute for little kids but I felt really stupid watching it as a 25 years old.",positive
"I am huge sf lover but i never liked hollywood superhero movies except maybe (nolan batman trilogy) because there is no suspense when you know in advance who will win. would you like to watch football match knowing the result in advance?secondly i don't like this ""back to the past"" cheat card. so every time you end up dead or don't like the outcome you can go into past undo things, bring dead back to life and change the present. so basically ""endgame"" isn't the end, if ""bad"" guys also can also travel back in time? ok, i know this film targeted teenager audience and cannot be to dark or too complex (like real life is). film was fun, but it would be much better if they didn't use this lame trick going into past after half of the characters ended up dead in previous film.",negative

amazing adventures and love u 3000",positive
"I have watch endgame 5 times, thanks to A-list. I really enjoy every detail of this movie. To be honest, entire marvel movies more like tv show to me, and this is the season finally, to be accurate far from home is the end of phase 3 but you know what I mean. Don't recommend newbie to watch btw, you will 100% got lost",positive
No Negative reviews.. This is one of my most favourite movies of 2019,positive
Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.,positive
"The Infinity Gauntlet trilogy was one of my most cherished comic books growing up. I would have never imagined it would become a movie one day. With each movie after the original Iron Man that truly started shaping the MCU, it was clear Marvel was taking the direction of adapting my beloved comic to the big screen. I was very apprehensive but they surpassed everything I could dream of. After some 30 MCU movies, they got the formula down to a science with the right amounts of action, funny, epic, touching and overall awesomeness to please most people and the result is a memorable experience that is a perfect conclusion of this generation of MCU. Bravo, and from that little kid who didn't have much besides comics growing up: thank you!",positive
"It perfectly concluded the movies I have been watching from the beginning. Acting was amazing, story was spectacular, and even though it was darker than most marvel movies, they still incorporated light-hearted comedy.",positive
"Thor : At first it was fun seeing the somehow beaten up image of Thor but this should have been fixed till the end of the movie. We never see him again in his glory and even worse we see his hammer being used by Captain America. It was lame and ruined the image of one of the best characters.
Iron man: They kill him.....because? Not sure. Since the stones are that great, why cant he heal himself with them?
Captain America: He just takes the perfect ending and so he changes the past that they told us that it cant be changed. But i suppose in his case is ok? Why shouldnt Thor have done the same? Why shouldnt he save his people? I see it as far more important than Captain Boring having a girlfriend.
Halk: They took ll the fun out of him, i dont see why they thought it was clever to fuse his 2 sides.
What was that scene that suddenly all women were attacking together? As a woman i feel insulted. I dont need anyone trying to empower me through fictional characters.",positive
"Truly amazing, i love how it was done in three parts. Act one dealing with the loss, act two getting the team and plan together and act three all out brawl for redemption!!!",positive
"Watching this movie I imagine screenwriters struggling to write decent scenes while the producers demand a grand, comic-book-style finale to satisfy every fan of every Avenger character. The result apparently succeeds in thrilling long-term Marvel Universe fans. For the rest of us this is a bewildering and mostly tedious mix of melodrama and overwrought FX actionI have watched, and often enjoyed, the previous films from the Marvel Cinematic franchise. So I'm familiar with the backstory of the characters. And I know to come to these movies prepared not only to suspend critical thinking but also to let my eyes glaze over during the prolonged action scenes. To the extent I was able to do this for 3 hours I was rewarded with enough situation comedy to keep me in my seat.But the melodramatic angst of the characters in the context of the plot is just irritating. Are you pining over the fact that your buddy might not survive the effort to resurrect the half of the living universe wiped out in Infinity War? Do you and every Avenger suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder?The only protagonists that hold my sympathy and respect for ""keeping it real"" are Tony Stark and Thor. (I'm not sure who merits more credit for that: their actors or their writers.) Otherwise I actually found myself rooting for Thanos: Though we may disagree with his objectives, at least he thinks big and doesn't indulge in ennui. He hews to his principles and does not hesitate to sacrifice himself for them. He is the only true hero in this movie, which makes it a tragedy.",positive
"Pains me to write this review, towards one of my beloved franchisesThe movie was BORING!!! When writers meet a block, they write about time machines, and really. that is where the movie flops. Before it even left the page to go on film
Lets sum up,
-1 hour and 30 minutes of recap from previous movie/boring SUPER slow amp up towards for an ending, just to explain the horrid choice of time travel
-20 minutes of action/climax, that was mostly a copy n past from earlier movies
-30 minutes of SLOW boring endingDont even get me started on Ms. Larson's flat acting, or the fact the Marvel Cannon was ignored.. Guess Capt America is now the God of Lightning? Right....
This is a disgrace to the Marvel franchise
Save your time, and money. Dont even rent this",negative
"Avengers: Endgame is the fourth Avengers film, the sequel to Avengers: Infinity War, and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by the Russo brothers, it is a near-perfect conclusion to the infinity saga and a brilliant culmination of 11 years worth of films.Following the events of Avengers: Infinity War, half of life in the universe has been wiped out after the intergalactic dictator Thanos (Josh Brolin) acquired all six infinity stones and snapped his fingers. In the aftermath of this horrific act, the last surviving Avengers bound together to come up with a plan to attempt to undo Thanos' actions whatever the cost may be.As emotional as it is entertaining, Avengers: Endgame concludes just about everything on a high note while at the same time opening doors to new exciting possibilities. Despite the film's three hour runtime, every minute is used carefully and thanks to the solid direction of the Russo brothers, it is never boring. Each important hero is used to their full extent and the audience is constantly reminded why we have invested so much in their character development after all this time. For anyone who has been following the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the past 11 years, this will most certainly not disappoint. Unlike previous Marvel films, there are no post credits scene to stay back for.I rate it a solid 9/10",positive
"Ok so, starting off I will admit I have never been huge into the MCU. But goddamn this movie was amazing. Hands down the best fight scene I've ever seen in a non animated film to date. And so far the only action movie to bring me to tears.",positive
"I don't know how they were able to keep things so cohesive. This is, arguably, part 22 of the longest story telling in the history of film. It so good and so intricate. There isn't a moment where you are bored but to understand all that's going on, at a minimum, you should watch Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel first... but to enjoy the full maximum benefit you really should watch all the Marvel films.I'm going to keep this spoiler free because I hate spoilers and besides...no one should be reading any reviews if you are planning on seeing this. You already know what's the deal now and you are either invested or you're not.Let me just say that the CGI is just gorgeous. This is a pretty thing to watch. Bradley Cooper'S Rocket is just a brilliant piece of voice acting. Chris Evans is the ultimate hero. Not the strongest or smartest but he totally sells you on being the truest.This film is pretty emotional at points... in unexpected places for me. And it is a must see on the big screen.I just realize I didn't really review the film in the typical sort of review but I can say that there are moments in the film where the audience cheered and you didn't mind. This is the Super Bowl of super hero films. I like the way they wrapped it up. And i bet it receives a Best Picture nod. It will not win but it will be nominated. It definitely will clean up in all the technical categories.God, I'm going to miss all of this. Going to see a Marvel movie or two, every year... i can't wait to own it so I can host a marathon. Please enjoy this with your friends and family.. because in the end that's what it's all about and this film drives home that point.",positive

"With last year's semi-cliffhanger, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019) had a lot of ground to cover to reach a satisfying conclusion of over ten years of filmmaking. It's no wonder that it's just a smidge over three hours since there's a lot of ground to cover here. I'll admit that the only instantiations of these superheroes that I'm familiar with is via the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Still, it was probably better to go into the finale this way, having no preconceived notions of how the characters should act or the lore they're connected to in the comic books.For a three-hour movie, Endgame moves at a steady pace that accelerates toward the inevitable conclusion. Following a standard three-act structure, Endgame benefited from bringing all the heroes together in Infinity War and establishing a baseline to work from and a goal to work toward. It was nice to see how each of these characters handled such a dramatic universal event. This is even to the point where some of the character transformations were quite hilarious (Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk is still a gem of the series). With the stakes already established, the collection of heroes felt like they were actually fighting for something instead of just reacting to actions thrust upon them.While this film lived up to my expectations, a few scenes were far from perfect. In particular, a scene or two felt like it was pandering to the audience and saying, ""Look how progressive we are!"" Sure, it was a neat bit and combined somewhat well with all the other amazing bits around it, but I almost had to groan at how forced it seemed. At the very least, Endgame wrapped up a ton of loose ends that have spanned a multitude of movies and left a definitive conclusion to the most ambitious filmmaking event of a generation.A fitting and almost perfect end to an epic saga, I give Avengers: Endgame 4.5 stars out of 5.",positive
"There's only one word that can describe the first 2/3 of the movie ""dry"". Not only was there no action, but they wasted characters and it was just boring. If it wasn't for the epic battle and the sacrifice in the last 1/3, I would rate this movie a 1 or 2.",positive
"Spectacular, Emotional, Joyful, Unexpected, Filled with Actions.. Avengers Endgame is lifetime achievement.. It's the conclusion of 22 films.. It's like end of an era.. So please watch it in Imax or 3D and don't spoil the movie.. You'll enjoy it very much.. The ending is very satisfying..",positive
"It has been 11 years since the MCU started with Iron Man in 2018, and in 180 minutes all those build up has concluded. It is a great ending and everyone who is affiliated to the MCU in any way should definitely watched it.
Low rating because of Captain Marvel and how easy it was for her.",positive
"Infinity War is possibly one of the greatest movies there ever was. It has superheroes, comedy and suspense in spades and has you on the edge of your seat for two and a half hours. If you're not laughing you are biting your fingernails.Endgame is not half the film of its predecessor. It could have been a masterpiece if the writers had only continued the same formula. Instead they turned it into something resembling an Ironman and Captain America tribute.One of the most appealing things about Infinity War was that all of the heroes had major parts, had amusing lines and were in situations that made you care about them. Endgame features appearances of about 1 minute for the majority of the Avengers except Ironman, Captain America, Antman and Hawkeye. Even Thor who had a lot of screentime is diminished and for no particular reason. I mean, this god nearly killed Thanos, yet in the next movie is reduced to a comedy sideshow?In all honesty the movie feels rushed, it's like they had a timeline to get it finished and went with the script that was the best of a poor bunch. I mean, what was the point of Captain Marvel and the major movie before? She featured for about 30 seconds in 3 hours. Infinity War insinuated she would have a major say in the outcome yet her screentime was barely worth a credit which was the same for most of the other Avengers. In fact, why market this movie as Avengers at all?After all of the hype and the absolute triumph that is Infinity War, two and a half hours with little more than talking, then one fight scene resembling, but not a patch on, the Wakanda fight does not give this movie a right to a good rating. MCU phase 3 should have finished with Infinity War, on a high at the end of a rollercoaster with questions that need to be answered. Endgame leaves the questions answered, but does it in a tame, humourless way.Instead of moving to phase four with a bang, Marvel have gone with a fingersnap...Saying that, at least I can now say I have a body like Thor!",negative
"As all of you have been, I've been waiting for this movie for a long long time. We've all had our expectations set high, and let me just say you could not see anything coming your way. Avengers Endgame is the perfect culmination of the eleven years of movies Marvel has given us, perfectly balanced, as all things should be. You're gonna cry, you're gonna laugh, you're gonna be surprised. Solid 10/10.",positive
"After following the Marvel films for more than 10 years, it was a beautiful 'end'. The movie starts with a slow paced emotional tone and catches speed as the story goes on. Some of the goodbyes given to the main characters were heart touching while others were heartbreaking.",positive
"First of all the first Avengers Movie 9/10,2nd Movie Age of Ultron 7/10,3rd Movie Infinity Wars 8/10,The 3rd End Games 8/10 and it's only for the 2nd half of the movie which made up for the first half.
THE FAULTS (SPOILERS AHEAD)
1.Why was Thanos so easy to Kill in the first 30mins of the film.
2.Fat Thor was funny at first than disappointing as made him out to be an idiot.
3.Time travel?You can't change anything?yet can go back and place the infinity stones back in time from where was taken from in the past?
4.The Hulk (No Fighting)
5.Captain America can hold Thor's Hammer and control lightening?Is he a GOD
6.Some of the final Characters only show up in the last 30mins of the film.
7.Gamera comes from the future (Then cant be seen in the end of the Movie with the other Gaurdians of The Galaxy.?(Did she return to the future).
8.Spiderman goes back to school,(5years into the future?).
9.Thanos without his glove was so hard to KILL at the end of the film?
10.No real build up to the end of the big fight,(As how did Thanos bring his army to the future)?
-Overall I love Sci-fiction and loved how the movie was put together to a point,as it seemed like the director,producer,writer couldn't put together If this was a,Kids Movie,Teenager Movie,Adult Movie or a Movie made for the Comic Book Fans.A lot of emotion in this film.
Anyhow kept me interested for 3hrs.
#11. HAWK & BLACKWIDOW scene (over done) OMG both of them fighting over who's going to kill them self. (Yet no one told them a SOUL for A SOUL).
#12.NO COMMENT ON CAPTAIN MARVEL not being there for infinity wars?",positive
"Avengers is the best movie ever. Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic event that must be witnessed on the big screen, marking the end of an era for Marvel but one that still exceeds expectations with fantastic writing, emotional value, nostalgia, and visuals and set pieces that will be remembered for the rest of however long superhero and action movies continue to be made. Thank you, Marvel Studios, for making such a sensational universe and making the experience of being a fan an unforgettable one.",positive
"After watching Avengers Endgame twice I can honestly say that it is the BEST marvel film to date. Without giving anything away, which is very hard, this movie is very emotional and intense. I have been a fan of this franchise since the beginning and this is the best ending they could've came up with. The way this movie plays out is not how I would've expected and I love that. It truly is Marvel's victory lap. While it is long it is very worth it. There has never been a movie like it before, with 21 films worth of build up, and there will most likely never be a movie like this again. As I said I've seen it twice and plan to go as many times as I can. It is a one of a kind experience. AND for the love of god don't spoil it for other people or yourself!!!! The best way to watch this movie with a clear mind. Free of any spoilers. If you do this, you are in for a real treat!",positive
"This movie is my favorite of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has the weight of trying to pay off eleven years of story and it does it well. And I'm not saying it's perfect, I'm just saying that the many positives easily outweigh the negatives. Speaking of negatives, I don't really like the Thorbowski storyline, Hulk not getting his rematch with Thanos, and 2014 Thanos being the villain, because of how they killed off 2023 Thanos within the first twenty minutes of the movie. But those are just a few negatives, that in no way holds down the movie. Because other than that I absolutely love this film and I think there's a reason it's literally the biggest movie of the past ten years. And don't even get me started on the final battle, which is unquestionably the greatest final battle of any MCU film.9.6/10.",positive
"The movie drags on at points and the beginning and goes into some tropes that create problems.Feels like a clear step back in character writing for the villains, excellent final act and epilogue.Infinity war is ultimately the superior movie.",positive
"If you've seen the Marvel movies, this is their Thank You to all the fans. They didn't care much for the logic or story. They just wanted everyone to feel happy.And they did. I'm happy. Everyone in the cinema was clapping at the end credits.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame. Overall it was... ok. The intro got off to a quicker start than I imagined, and the expected final battle was certainly fun followed by a touching denouement. Those elements (barely) justify the film, in my opinion.However, the intervening 2 hours is a tedious collection of scenes, lame jokes and awful characterizations wrapped around an extremely tired and poorly thought out plot device. Should you see it? Sure. How can you not after investing so many years in the arc? But most people I saw it with were ultimately (at least somewhat) disappointed.Worst performance in the movie is easily Mark Ruffalo who has now solidified his legacy as the absolute worst Hulk and Banner ever committed to film. Thor was also terrible, but that's been a rapid devolution since Ragnarok.Surprisingly, the movie was pretty much stolen by the stellar performance of Jeremy Renner, which should build interest in the upcoming Hawkeye series (even if it is just a vehicle to hand off the mantle). Scarlett Johansson also stepped up her game and was very impressive.",positive
"Oh my God! This movie is horrible... stupid story.
They ""stuffed"" all the superhero characters, but why? The story did not better because of it. Confused, silly movie. I hate it.",negative
"The conculsion of the arc set up in the first three phases of Marvel is, to say the least, without a doubt the best MCU film to date. That is no small feat.Rather than just undoing the brilliant dark ending of its predecessor, it delves into the failures and shortcomings of the outcome in a brilliant and very important way, that is not often seen in these kind of lighthearted adventures.There are lots of brilliant twists and turns that are very much appreciated, and without spoiling anything, this film handles all that is set up in Infinity War gracefully.Overall, it is a beautifully made film, some of the best effects ever seen in film and incredible cinematograpy and cutting. It features some of the best battles ever put together.Truly a grand finale that I am glad to have seen at its premiere. Fantastic finale, and there is more, far more, to come from this wonderful franchise!",positive
This was a good movie. Loved it!!!! Loved the ending too!!!!!!,positive
"*Spoiler free review*What can I say, I am just another die hard Marvel studios fan that happened to literally cry while watching the saga end..When Iron man first came out back in 2008 my brother told me there is this new super hero movie where the guy wears a robocop like suit to fight bad guys. Growing up hearing mostly names like superman, batman n spiderman I really didnt care about Ironman. To me it was just another movie that wouldn't even get past the first installment.Little did I knew it would leave such a great impact on me and my feelings. So strong enough to keep me at the edge on my seat and fill my heart with soo many emotions that I never thought I had for all my favorite characters.If you are a Marvel fan like me, I bet you really don't need to depend on reviews like these. Because there is nothing that can stop you from watching the movie, if anything you could simply read reviews to feel excited and joyful to see soo many crazy fans like yours who have grown with all our superheroes together share their emotions and experiences.I wanna write so much, but at the same time I wanna save your time so you could go and watch this movie already. Just like me I am sure you have plenty of favorites that you love onscreen, and I can guarantee you that this movie will not only make it more nostalgic but also give you a permanent reason to love them for what they are and what they stood for, and how they ended their epic journey, forever in your heart.After all, we are meant to lose people we love, how else would we know how important they are to us?What a movie, what a journey, what a conclusion, what an epic battle, what a fun ride, what an emotional roller coaster, what a heartbreaking moment(s), what an amazing performance, what a timing, what a dialogue delivery, what a beautiful celebration!",positive

"I haven't heard more people upset about spoilers since the Star Wars prequels, so please consider this sentence the spoiler space you very well may need if you don't want to learn more. Then again, I'm going to discuss the idea of this film more than the actual movie itself.Avengers: Endgame is the blockbuster of 2019. It's a juggernaut that has the biggest cast of any superhero film ever, wrapping up almost 12 years of storyline and multiple movies, all to answer the question that came up at the end of Avengers: Infinity War: after you kill half of everything, what happens next?There's been a lot of soapboxing and online hand wringing about this film. Plenty of people feel the need to show that they're above the paltry populace, happy to proclaim their intellectual superiority and state that comic book related films demand that adults remain stuck in the days of adolescence. Much like the issues of today's politics, I'm not going to change anyone's mind that feels that way. All that ends up is two people shouting their talking points and refusing to learn anything from one another. But my snide comment is this: can't you just leave well enough alone?This is a popcorn movie that appeals to the biggest audience ever. And that's fine. You can ignore it if you like - we've never lived in a time where there's more opportunity to enjoy the media that you want. Me, I ignore mumblecore, critic beloved films and Oscar-bait movies for the most part. And that is also fine.All that I know is that I've seen nearly every Marvel film with the same set of guys that I've seen movies with since I was 25 or so. Each movie is an event where we get the chance to grab a meal, catch up and enjoy one another's company in the midst of our exceedingly stressful and busy lives. If a movie can do that, it's already a success before you even watch one frame. Movies bring us together, a light on the cave wall where we can hear a fantastic tale that's bigger than us. That's what this movie is - modern mythology of larger than life heroes who are the best of all of us battling the worst villains possible.Spoiler warning part two - here's where I get into major plot points. You've been warned.More than the overall tale, I enjoyed the story beats here. Hawkeye becoming Ronin, enraged that evil survived the purge while his family did not. The main sacrifice of this film isn't Black Widow's, but his. He was the first person who saw her as more than a killing machine and gave her a chance at life. Now, she repays the favor, taking him from killing machine back to family man. However, he must sacrifice their friendship and the knowledge that her loss will always be in the background when measured against the perceived greater loss of Iron Man.But hey - I've always loved the background characters more than the heavy hitters.There are moments here that really portray what the three main Avengers have had to give up to protect us. Iron Man must lose the stability and family he never knew he needed. Captain America's longing for Agent Carter, trapped by a glass wall that may as well be decades and not inches thick. Thor's descent into depression as he realizes that he couldn't save the day. Their fates each show them finally achieving the final part of their hero's journey save Thor, who is fated to repeat his journey over and over throughout rebirth after rebirth, even after Ragnarok, the end of all things.Those small moments mean more than the big explosions and special effects throughout this film. Tony's quick hug with his unsuspecting father. Thor's moment with his mother, who sees right through his deceptions. Even Quill's way too brief reunion with Gamora. The heart behind each charcter is why we care. There are hundreds of superpowered characters on the screen. The fact that we know the minute motivations of more than one of them is a credit to this tale.I love that this film both wraps up and begins new stories at its close. Sam Wilson must become Captain America, finally receiving the approval and friendship of the Winter Soldier. Thor realizes that his role is to be an adventurer, not the king, and gives the ownership of Asgard to Valkyrie. Even Steve Rogers realizes that despite becoming a grief counselor and telling people to live the new life they've been given, when the opportunity arises to return to his life, it's one he should embrace.Speaking of Rogers, I haven't heard an audience start cheering in the theater for a long time. The fact that he's able to lift Mjolnir, Thor's hammer, was not lost on this audience. Before, he was able to budge it. Now, his journey has made him truly worthy to lead the forces against Thanos, even if he appears alone at the seeming conclusion of the final battle.I also like the synchronicity that the first words that kicked off the Marvel cinematic universe were Tony Stark saying, ""I am Iron Man,"" which are also his last words. There's just something poetic about that.Hey look - I was happy that Crossbones got a few seconds of screentime. I'm that kind of geek. And if that fact upsets you, I'm never going to convince you that this is a good movie.",positive
This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in my entire life!! It's the best super hero movie ever!! It deserves a lot of Oscars. It's just epic!!!,positive
"""Endgame"" starts out well, presenting a credible atmosphere of doom and gloom in the wake of our heroes' colossal failure at the end of Infinity War. Much of the first act concerns grief and coping strategies, and Thanos creator Jim Starlin aptly gets a cameo as part of a support group, much to the delight of long-time Marvel fans.Then Ant-Man somehow pops out of the quantum realm and everything soon falls apart, in terms of a coherent narrative. If you're in this mainly for sheer emotion and fan-pleasing gestures, you'll still love it. But if you give the plot twists much thought, you won't.The characters make fun of time-travel movies such as ""Back to the Future"" ... but then go on to set wholly new standards for convoluted, improbable, and paradoxical time conundrums that no amount of explaining can address, and appealing to ""alternate realities"" splitting off is just hand-waving here. Nebula kills her earlier self but is unaffected? Thanos from 2014 is killed in 2023, so Infinity War is erased ... along with everything that this movie is supposed to be correcting. Most grievously of all, Cap goes completely against character and decides to lead a normal life in the past (irresponsibly neglecting the threats of the Red Skull, Hydra, etc.), thereby erasing his solo trilogy of films and much more. And so on.In addition, Thor is treated miserably, having been turned by the writers into a fat slob wallowing in self-pity and despair, even though early on he avenges the Snap he had just barely failed to prevent. This is the same guy who showed up in Wakanda? And Thanos, after Brolin's brilliantly nuanced portrayal in Infinity War, is pretty much reduced to a cardboard villain as well as in stature.Throughout, stuff just happens without adequate preparation or internal logic. I loved the scene in ""Age of Ultron"" when Cap was barely able to budge Thor's hammer, much to the thunder god's momentary chagrin. But now Cap can suddenly wield it effortlessly in combat? How convenient. And how exactly does Stark get the Infinity Stones from Thanos and do so all at once without being disintegrated, or at the very least majorly stunned, by their titanic power? Even if we accept the improbable sleight-of-hand here, recall how stunned Thanos himself was each time he acquired just a single gem. But Stark can acquire all six at once and not blink an eye? I guess we're supposed to be too caught up in the moment, loving the ""poetic justice"" of situations, to think about these improbabilities and internal inconsistencies. But a better version of this film would have been written in such a way that it both pleases and makes sense, at least in its own established fantasy terms.Frankly, you could easily navigate a space shuttle through the gaping plot holes in this narrative, and that's a serious problem. I could have focused more on some of the movie's strengths, such as some of the performances, the epic effects, and Silvestri's powerful score, but for me, this was certainly not the satisfying final act I had been hoping for.",positive
"This was an emotional roller coaster, extremely good. It had just the right amount of comedy, sadness, excitement, and everything in between to make you remember this movie forever. I would definitely recommend you to watch, although I have to say, what the hell were you all doing with your lives if you still didn't watch it yet.",positive
"Overall its a good movie and may be an okay finale, it seems like the Seinfeld finale, after a great run a disappointing end, the movie story didnt have fluidity and seems the writers just wanted to finish all endings quickly rather than the smooth flow like in infinity war",positive
Stan Lee is rolling in his grave what a horrible movie.Longtime comic collector and marvel enthusiast have just made my life easier. I will never be watching a marvel movie again.,negative
"I saw this movie the day it came out in my country (Israel) and I was amazed. I was happy, sad, excited, angry all at the same time in this movie, it has everything in it.All our favorite Avengers are coming back and team up again after being broken down and hurt and it's so amazing to see that.You won't regret seen this and of course in the movie theater!!!",positive
"What it needs to be a hero? Power? No. Sacrifice? Yes. It's not the end. There will always be a fight worth fighting for. There will always be a dream to avenge. Never ever give up. Do whatever it takes. And be a hero. Thank you MCU for giving us 10 years of lovely memories. To teach us about love, friendship and determination. It was a wonderful experience, thank you again.",positive
Not really expected that kinda of ending as it's superhero movie always gets good at end this doesn't; story and drama was good ; time traveling concept explained is confusing; little more action scenes was expected ; Already missing the lost heroes.,positive
It's even better Than Last year Infinity War Age Of Ultron was ok and the first Avengers Movie Greet. Endgame was the Greatest Superhero In history,positive
"The movie doesn't waste time with any recapitulation. It assumes we, as the movie-goers, are already familiar with what happened in the preceding movie. And, so, it starts off with a bittersweet opening scene at the Barton family picnic.As in, Mr. and Mrs. Clint Barton and their three lovely children.From there, we--the audience--are shown the ultimately fruitless aftermath. Not just three weeks into the future (where Thanos is anti-climactically executed by Thor). But, five _years_ into the future, as well!I don't want to spoil everything for those of you who haven't seen it, yet. Suffice it to say that the solution to the problem (inspired by Paul Rudd-as-Scott Lang) makes great use of all the past films. Both stock footage and new scenes ingeniously spliced together!*Of course, this wouldn't be a Marvel film without a little poignancy sprinkled throughout. Cap, as a grief counselor trying to believe every word he's telling to his ""patients."" Tony Stark, as a man trying to be just as brilliant at being a father as he was an inventor. And Bruce Banner, trying to hang on to the miraculous integration of his brains and the Hulk's brawn.Of course, there's also some comedy relief in the form of an overweight Thor and an out-of-place Rocket Raccoon!In short, we--the audience--at the movie theater where we saw this did just as we were supposed to; we laughed, cheered, clapped, and cried. And in all the right places. Especially the climactic battle scene against Thanos' past self...and his army. Of course, being a battle, not all the Good Guys come out alive. A lot of the returning characters (those ""finger-snapped"" out of existence by Thanos in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR) don't survive this second encounter with him. But, any watery eyes the rest of you get over the sad stuff will almost immediately be cancelled out by tears of joy.In short? If you go to see this movie, you will enjoy it. I guarantee it. And if you don't? Then, you must've gotten soul-gemmed!

"Following last year's Infinity War we are given free tickets to ride the emotional roller-coaster. I don't think I have experienced so many goosebumpy moments in one movie before which I am sure all of the Marvel fans will agree with.Of course, due to this being the end of an era it is going to be emotional but what else does the movie have going for it?High quality performances? Of course! Starting with the heart of the Marvel movies, Robert Downey Jr (Iron Man/Tony Stark) I think stood out above all. This is all down to the MCU being kicked off with RDJ and then the final snap ending with him. 21 movies building up to this and it was totally smashed by RDJ with a performance that I think deserves an Oscar nomination. It was gripping and you really felt everything he was feeling as it was conveyed so well. So much so that I had a tear in my eye when Spiderman (Tom Holland) returned and it even had me sobbing at the very end with his death and at his funeral. Top that with all of those people the character had an impact on throughout the movies and you get a really heart wrenching moment. Let's not forget about the performances from others as at no point did I feel anyone was slacking during this film. The young Tom Holland was most definitely impressive but Chris Hemsworth really did show how good of an actor he is in this movie. I feel like he doesn't get as much credit as he should in terms of the performances he gives.In terms of the story I feel as if the wait from the last movie (Infinity War) was definitely worth it. I especially liked that it took its time and wasn't just mindless combat the whole way through. I believe it really help the characters develop even more, obviously some more than others. An example of this would be Hawkeye, where as before you knew he had a family and he was the sort of 'dad' of the Avengers. This time it really shows what means the most to the character and what he is willing to do for what he cares about most. Also Jeremy Renners performance as Hawkeye in this movie was most certainly his best so far. Towards the end of the movie during the combat sequences I was amazed. From Captain America wielding Mjolnir all the way to the the infamous leader finally saying ""Avengers Assemble"". I just feel like everything I wanted to happen, happened. All of the characters came together well and there was even a woman power moment to keep everyone happy, in my opinion I don't know what else could be added!In terms of the special effects it was definitely almost perfect and it helped set the scene. The only flaw that stood out to me was when the characters came through the portal from Titan, the green screen shot seemed to stand out like a sore thumb. Other than that, with all those characters and entities on screen at once that need to be computer generate I think it was incredibly well made and I really give a round of applause to everyone that worked on this movie. A special round of applause goes to the Russo brothers for making something so special and astonishing.I think this is definitely the best movie so far in the MCU, a movie that will be difficult to trump. What am I looking forward to in the upcoming phase? Roll on Spiderman Far From Home and the Black Widow prequel movie!",positive
I was seriously in awe the entire time! Definitely worth the wait and the length! Every marvel fan will be proud of this movie through and through! I can't fathom how amazing this movie is! No doubt the greatest movie marvel has made.,positive

"The plot is compact and the details are excellent! Many tears, touching. Set the whole room roaring with laughter and make complaints about the max. Although I think about it carefully, the plot is still a bit buggy. For example, where does someone's army get so many particles to transmit. In the past, Loki ran away with the magic cube of the universe, whether it would affect the later time line changes, how to get back on track, dare not play through the details, that's all.",positive
"This is Marvel's most epic film, and possibly the whole history of cinema. Dramatic, profound, with comedy, TOO EMOTIONAL, and a great final worthy and good closing for our heroes. The last minutes are an ode, ALL THE PEOPLE APPLAUDED and then the room completely silent with a lump in the throat, the tears came out and ran down my cheeks.The bar is very high for the future of cinema. I do not have the slightest doubt that it will be the highest grossing film in history, unseating Titanic, Star Wars Ep. 7 and Avatar. (Until the Lion King arrives)",positive
"I don't understand why people give 10/10 ? cuz of drama ? it's avengers not shawshank i expected a real plan against thanos but time travel ? it's like they tried to write a thanos plan but they failed so they said "" okay let's do time travel "". gg wp",positive
"Well, what can I say? I am extremely lost for words. I won't spoil the plot, but all I can say is go see this film!!! It's going to be hard to say goodbye to the actors that played the iconic original six Avengers characters. You would defiantly feel bittersweet while watching the film. I laughed, I cried, I gasped! I felt the same emotions when I watched Infinity War!!GO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!",positive
"Just because Marvel made the movie Hollywood's highest-grossing doesn't mean that this is one of the best Movies in the history, also this is not one of the best movies of the Superheroes genre, not even the best Marvel movie which is Iron Man since this is the only one decent they have in their lousy repertoire called the MCU.Sorry fanboys but is the true.",positive
"It was suppose to be the most anticipating movie for any marvel fans after waiting for over a decade, but alas the story line was just repeating itself, rather lets just call it Avengers: Endgame repeated stories from the past films!
time travel was another huge disappointment! shows real lazy writing, screen cast etc! there are more than 14 million ways the screenwriter and director could have made it different!
a few punch lines and the end fight was only worth the money spent for watching it!
as a whole i would just say sorry marvel you just lost it ! please don't bring back anymore of your films!
you just lost a huge fan after watching this crap!

"Man, Oh Man!
Not only a movie, what an experience it is!We always knew in today's science, with all those facts and fictions, knowledge and theories - everything is possible when you sit down to write a fictional fable based on science. But the greater challenge is surely to make the story believable. And the Avengers series is the finest exemplar till now.Having said that, not all the incidents in Endgame are scientifically logical. First of all of course the Time Travel thing. Many movies built, many theories devised, but none without objections and counter arguments. But Endgame chooses to daringly overlook all the the basic accepted rules of time travel till now. Nebula killing Nebula, Cap fighting with himself and so on. All those invite so many paradoxes and holes. Plus joining the Quantum reality with time traveling also seems a little too much.But well, we are not judging MCU with those logic. They do not claim to create Sci-Fi movies anyway. They have placed themselves in a comfortable position where all the sci-fi theories can be consumed and exploited; and can also be freely ignored whenever necessary.Coming back on the movie, all the characters contributed to the cause, all those little open threads weaved back cleanly, all the disjointed dots blended back beautifully, even new historical events kept on popping up in between and seamlessly got integrated in the current affairs. Wiring up a story with all those characters, their histories, their cinematic importances (read individual brands) is not a facile thing, but they pulled it off masterfully.Come, and experience the ultimate larger than life visual delight. See it in your IMAX, you won't regret any penny spent.Pretty sure they had written the Endgame story first, and then the Infinity one to knit back all the corners down. And pretty sure they have stories of the next episodes of Avengers and of the individual's in their kitty. But all the members of the Avengers family got so colossal image after battling such a mammoth interstellar opponent, fighting with some earthly nuisances would might make them funny.
9/10 for the marvelous experience, one point deducted for overlooking some basic principles.",positive
"An experience of a lifetime.
The end of an era.
An era of entertaining movies and characters we grew to love.
When Marvel Studios put everything they had to make "" Iron Man"", who would have thought that we would end up here.
How do you top ""Infinity War""?
Simple, you start over.
What does this movie have?
A Fat God of Thunder.
A raccoon who sends mails.
A green superhero who is incredibly funny.
A superhero that not all kids are familiar with.
And of course, a mad purple being burdened with the prospect of bringing balance to the universe.
When you walk into the movie, you expect action.
And you jump right straight into it.You will revisit old MCU movies.
You will follow the original Avengers as they try to reverse the destruction caused by Thanos.
You will laugh, you will cry, you will shout your guts out. In the end, you will be quiet.
Because this was what was supposed to hapoen.
Part of the journey is the end.Shoit-your-guts out scenes:
Cap is worthy of Mjolinr.
Hail Hydra.
Thanos getting his head chopped off.
Avengers assemble.
Cap Marvel kicks Thanos' ass
And of course "" I am... Iron Man""The arc ends with where it began.

"Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic triumph, a film that not only delivers on the promise of its predecessors but surpasses them in every way. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Endgame serves as the culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first three phases, a fitting conclusion to a decade of storytelling that has captured the imaginations of audiences around the world.The film picks up where its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War, left off, with half of all life in the universe wiped out by the mad Titan Thanos (Josh Brolin). The remaining Avengers, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), are left to pick up the pieces and figure out a way to reverse the devastating effects of Thanos' actions.From the opening moments, it's clear that Endgame is a film that is willing to take risks and push boundaries. The opening scene, which features Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) losing his family to the snap, sets a somber and emotional tone that carries throughout the rest of the film. The first act of the film is a slow burn, a chance for the characters to reflect on their losses and grapple with the enormity of the task before them. This may be off-putting to some viewers who are expecting non-stop action, but for those willing to invest in the characters and the story, the payoff is immense.The film's cast is its greatest asset, with each actor delivering a nuanced and heartfelt performance that adds depth and dimension to their respective characters. Downey Jr. In particular shines as Tony Stark, bringing a vulnerability and rawness to the character that we haven't seen since the first Iron Man film. Evans' Captain America is similarly impressive, his stoicism and unwavering sense of duty serving as a counterpoint to Stark's more emotional journey.Hemsworth's Thor is another standout, his grief and guilt over his failure to stop Thanos in Infinity War manifesting in a new physical appearance and a deeper understanding of what it means to be a hero. Johansson's Black Widow and Ruffalo's Hulk also get their moments to shine, with the former taking on a leadership role and the latter finally finding a way to merge his two identities into one.The film's action sequences are breathtaking, with each set piece offering something new and exciting. The final battle, in particular, is a feast for the senses, with every Avenger getting their chance to shine and the stakes never feeling anything less than monumental. The use of time travel as a plot device could have easily become convoluted and confusing, but the Russos handle it with a deft touch, using it to both move the story forward and offer moments of nostalgia and reflection.The film's technical elements are also top-notch, with the visual effects team delivering some of the most impressive work in the history of cinema. The use of color and lighting in particular stands out, with each scene carefully crafted to convey a specific mood or emotion. The score by Alan Silvestri is another highlight, with the composer using themes and motifs from previous Marvel films to tie everything together and create a sense of unity and cohesion.If there's one flaw to be found in Endgame, it's that the film may be too reliant on its own mythology. While longtime fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe will no doubt revel in the film's callbacks and Easter eggs, newcomers may find themselves lost or confused by some of the references. However, this is a minor quibble in an otherwise flawless film.In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is a monumental achievement, a film that transcends its genre and serves as a testament to the power.",positive
I personally preferred most of the other movies. It was just way too predictable and not that funny.,positive
"What a waste of time. I am so sorry for all the Thor & Hulk fans. I really am. Movie makers played everyone for fools with all the hype. Lord of the Rings and Avatar remains my all time favorite. My advice to all those who havent watched the movie yet, please do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD. It is highly likely that you will feel wasted like me, so at least you will have saved the money.",negative

"ProsYou wont notice the time. 3 hours?? Pfftt, feels like 2.Each character gets his/her time to shine.The plot is definitely interesting enough to hold the attention span of action-only nerds.Cons:Don't compare this movie to Infinity War.I don't wanna spoil the movie by explaining too much.Go see it.",positive
"This film was a beautiful ending to the saga of Avengers, although we do not know if there are more films awaiting us. It was such a meaningful film, with so many touching moments that make us think back to the old times of Avengers, one of the most iconic groups we will ever see in this generation. Avengers made me cry, which was not expected. Not one single superhero adventure saga movie has ever made me cry. But this one did. Infinity War left me breathless, and Endgame left me even more speechless. Iron Man's death was so well crafted, so deep and meaningful. This film portrays everything Marvel ever had. Everybody. One huge entire family. The film unfolding every step of the way. This film is truly an unforgettable one.",positive
"The craft of this last story is almost perfect. I am a critic of all flaws and I found myself still looking for anything else but one concept flaw regarding a single character. Thanos is a fearsome foe even without the stones and credible at it. The whole in the souls of the survivors are showing in their eyes, passing through the screen, towards the audience. The acting is good, very good, despite this being a genre much widowed by real scrutiny in this respect. I even shed a tear for the eyes of the kid who never answered Antman's question and rode away on his bicycle. I smiled on some of the finger snapping being done at certain points. I actually lived the story and felt it reached a true and righteous ending. Thank you guys for bringing this story to us and our kids and remember us to cherish the presence of our loved ones each and every moment for each and every moment we spend hating others is a lost one on them.",positive
"There is a lot more right with this movie then wrong. Marvel fans will love it. It is too long by about 35 minutes and focuses mostly on the original six Avengers (who after 20 Marvel films are no longer the most exciting of the line up). The battle scenes are amazing but also happen so fast it will all be a blur. (It's meant to be watched more then a few times.) The plot is confusing and Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) is barely in it. (A big over sight as her film was a major box office hit.) Unless you are a fan (and who isn't) you'll want to take a hard pass on this one. Do not watch it in 3D!! The glasses just darken an already gloomy screen image. Not worth it. Otherwise, it's a fun popcorn movie with enough emotional highs and lows to merit the hype surrounding it. Might be best to see it in IMAX or at the drive in.",positive
"Maybe it's because they overdid marketing on this movie and it ended up raising my expectations to ridiculous levels, but I was honestly disappointed when I watched the movie. The final battle was... Boring. And I get that you're all for feminism nowadays, but do you really need to repeat the whole ""us girls got your back"" scene like you did in Infinity War?",positive
"It's the right ending for the movie yet a bit sad at the same time
it has a great combination of action humor and drama
I loved how they linked the events to the past and I also liked how they end it
the only downside that I thought Captain Marvel would have a major role into all if this but in other side i am glad she didn't
I don't know I considered that as a downside anyway
....
I am just sad that we lost Ironman or I could say Robert Downey jr
it was the perfect ending for him even for Captain America.

this movies shows in depth the motion of most of the Avengers in a good way
it's the best Movie that Marvel offered
I just hope they don't lose it after this movie

Thank you Marvel",positive
"A lot of people clearly liked the Avengers: Endgame. I heard Chris Evans cried in some places when he watched the finished movie. I could see what he meant but I didn't cry. In fact there was so much going on that I felt I needed a scorecard. Who was on screen, what was their motivation and what happened 2, 3 or 4 movies ago. I have seen all the movies but clearly not as up on it as some I met, who apparently had seen some of the movies several times.Overall not bad but here are a few moans -The infinity stones always seemed a MacGuffin to me. They appeared from nowhere and had strange powers, often not explained much or used much either.I heard but don't really get Thanos's motivation. He seems to have some hand wavy reason for wanting to reduce the universe's population. Paradoxically, even though, he's the villain it plays into the rather PC idea that there are too many people. People are a blessing, not a curse.Captain Marvel was played up a bit. She's the only one who can save the universe? Apparently she's been busy elsewhere until now.Now in conclusion, not bad but not good. OK movie but could have been shorter for my liking.For comparison, I had a brief look at what I'd watched in a cinema from the last 12 months and the ones that stood out include First Man, Shazam, Glass, Jurassic Wrold: Fallen Kingdom, Deadpool 2, The Happy Prince, Christopher Robin, Green Book, White Crow, Dumbo, Wild Rose. I find most of them better than Endgame.",positive
"Three words to describe the methodology inherent in destroying a franchise - or any story for that matter. For all the intrigue, conjecture, speculation, and cosmic potential Endgame enjoyed long before its release - and might have included - they opted for the least fascinating and pedestrian of stories: when it all else fails, just go back in time and change it! I do not mind heavy CGI movies with no substance; they're entertaining from a technical perspective, and when a decent story props it up, at least there exists some satisfaction. That said, with Infinity War, there was great possibility. I'm not going to bother with a detailed review here ... this movie was wrong ... all those richly detailed characters, all those amazing back stories, all that simmering creativity, all that ingenuity and inspiration totally and utterly wasted. I gave it 4 Stars just because it's nice to end the misery, but it is difficult to appreciation the wastefulness. Sad really.",negative

The star rating doesn't go to 11 and this film deserves it. Ties everything together beautifully. Great acting and a great story. 3 hours zipped by. If marvel movies are your thing you won't be disappointed.,positive
"Don't enter the theatre with preconceived notions of what you wanted them do do with this movie, no. Instead let it unfold as Infinity Wars did, an unexpected storm. This movie was epic, the acting, the cinematography, the story, the mixture and combinations of joy, pai, and suspense...all the years of a finally woven Marvel heroic tapestry. Finished. But in a way that leaves me yearning for more, but relishing the memories of the characters I once simply read about as a child from the 60s to seeing them in the big screen like never before. Man this was a great movie! A must see. Hollywood Oscar folks time to stop overlooking these cinematic treasures. There were some Oscar worthy performances in here. Phase was of the age of marvelous Marvel heroes hit it crescendo. And it was one for the ages!",positive
Overall average movie still infinity war is the best..they ruined some of the mcu characters such as Thor and Hulk. In the last 21 films we knows that how strong is thor bt in the endgame thor was a in a comic role only they ruined the character.emotional weight of the story is rly praise worthy cinematography and visuals are marvelous.like the matter of thor plenty of mistakes is there in the film. Overall average film,positive
"After Infinity War came out it was going to be a tough task for Endgame to top it. In many ways of course Endgame is more satisfying because it brings this iteration of the MCU to a rousing, emotional conclusion.As much as I came out of the theater with a great big smile on my face and even some tears were shed. I can't help think that there could have been some things that could have been changed that would make the film better. The running time is certainly daunting. The first hour is very somber as it had to be bit it does take the film alot of time to get its footing. The 2 things that really bothered me were the handling of Hulk and Thor. I have never been a fan of Mark Ruffalo as David Banner/Hulk. Here he is turned into a hybrid of both characters, it didn't work for me. But even worse they turned Thor into a joke character. I really didn't like this. I get that Ragnarok reset the character on a more comedic path but they went overboard here. The performances are really good, especially Robert Downey Jr. He has been the center of the MCU and has carried it well. Chris Evan's is very good as Captain America. Everyone gets their moments. The film is less frenetic and more introspective than Infinity War. But the last hour is pure magic. They went all out and succeeded at least in the conclusion.The great thing is that the MCU for all of the bombast and high budget effects that the films feature they have very good character development and arcs. We care about what happens to them. It us no easy feat with such a wide variety of characters that they could pull it off so well.But they did.",positive
"This film was a marvel masterpiece, and had it not hav had the flaws im gona mention it wud hav got 10/10, but what they did with hulk and thor gutted me, hulk, since avengers 1 has had a weakend state, in each and every film, weaker and weaker, i gave them infinity war because i was expecting a big thanos finalè with hulk, but saying i was let down is an understatement!!! He was there biggest trump card!!!! And theyve totally taken all the aggression out of him, stupid!!! Really stupid!!! Then thor was made to look a gimmick, even wen he was worthy with both axes he was still fat, stupid. Then the lineup with the women superheros was totally ridiculous!!! Then theres captain marvel, who didnt even get a messed up hair doo by thanos never mind a whopping!! So who cares who captain marvel fights in capt marvel 2??? Cus if the powerfullest villian in the universe cant beat her then who cares!!! U can tell which way marvel are going in the future. These flaws was totally ridiculous to me, if these errors had of been rectified i wud hav given it 10/10 but if 8.5/10 was a fair score to me,",positive
"(To read ONLY if you saw the movie)
I want to make sure that this review is more about pointing out the reasons why I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would.As big, lasting fan of Marvel, I had trouble enjoying this long-waited finale at the fullest. After being left lost and confused on the event of Infinity War, we had to wait for a year to fully understand what was going to happen, and few months to start getting ideas with the small, lying, teasers. Yes, I say « lying » teasers, because today, most of Marvel's trailers provide false scenes that either make you hope or bewilder you (true MCU fans know what I'm talking about). Once more trailers were released and more information given, I was even more hyped. But when I sat at the theatre, watched the adventurous story unwrap, I started noticing how flawed and holed the narrative was. The first 5 minutes are amazing, I won't lie. But then, the story turns into this sad and forced comedy where we see a feeble Hulk dabbing, a depressive Thor that indulge his friends to play Fortnite, Tony being a jerk as always - even though he has a daughter, which I thought would have changed his stubbornness - and of course, the most annoying character of all time, a greedy overpowered woman named Captain Marvel. Then, we have the chance to understand how are they going to retrieve the stones in the past, and when it could explain it a very easy explanation, Hulk gives us the most complicated explanation about time-travel I have ever heard (you need to see the movie to understand this part). Then as the story goes on, we have a bit of action, a crying Thor (again), a great teamwork between Tony and Steve, a sad event with Natasha's sacrifice, and then once all stones are recovered, we jump immediately towards the nano-gauntlet getting the stones attached to it. We have no idea how Tony built it, how much time has passed, what is this new Thanos doing... nothing. Leaving a massive hole in the story (just like the ending).But I prefer talking about the real issue of this movie - which isn't the massive CGI content that really is a significant reason why this movie discards itself from real cinema - which is the final battle. That battle can appear epic, for someone who only crave action and lasers and people dying from team-working heroes. But if you pay close attention to that moment, the battle doesn't make any sense at all. At any moment, they could just shred Thanos - like late arriving Captain Marvel shredded his ship in the blink of an eye. They are so many heroes, all together, strength attached, powers combined, and none decides to think « let's take him all together ». No, instead everybody just prefer attacking the meaningless troops that other characters like Wong, or the Wakanda's army can take care of. It's ridiculous. I know, the directors need to build tension and really focus the main characters's mindsets when it comes to fight - and of course, the actors's contracts that determine if someone will die or not. But that battle was straight up messed up. You're telling me, that in 14 million possibilities, no one sliced up Thanos's arm? The whole movie got destabilised because of Dr. Stranger's line saying they only won one battle. Yes, it creates tension and a very unpredictable story, but it lacks of sense.Eventually, Marvel is no longer supposed to make sense. Now, it's just action, bad writing, and all about the actor's contracts.",positive

"WARNING: this review, like others, may give you a bias when watching the movie. Please keep in mind that this is mostly my opinion.From the end of 'Avengers: Infinity War' I have felt as though the story was incomplete, as though the movie ended before the climax. But I guess that was the point. Because Endgame is the climax, the finale, the ultimate conclusion.The opening few minutes were ingenious for building on the concept of how impactful Thanos' actions were. Someone must have cried in that scene. I can't say I saw what was coming in the next, maybe, 20 minutes.Moreover, it was even harder to think of what could possibly come AFTER those 20 minutes. But I suppose with the Infinity Gauntlet about, there's no telling what will happen, which kills the sense of wonder in this Marvel universe.
Besides these 20 minutes, I was not that impressed by the remaining first half of the movie, but boy, did the last half pay off! Movies like this make me wonder if cinematography can get any better (for example, the opening scene of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice).I am not a huge Marvel fan, so I won't be able to notice all of the inconsistencies that this movie apparently has with the first movie (according to several fans I know), but I am confident that Marvel Studios has the answers. I always did like the first The Avengers movie, by the way.I don't like what happened to Thor (if you have seen the movie, then you'll know what I mean) and the Hulk thing was weird at first, but I got used to it.Maybe I'm the only one who didn't find this movie ""an emotional rollercoaster"", but then again, I'm not a huge Marvel fan. Similarly, I didn't get most of the jokes even though I have seen most of the movies. Regardless, the movie sure doesn't disappoint and I liked the ending, too.I primarily gave this movie a ⭐9 because of how much it stands out from the other (is it 21?) movies.",positive
"You know what surprised me the most about this film? It's that it had some minor problems that - in any other film - would bug me out, but in this film, I honestly didn't care about them. The small issues here and there were overshadowed greatly by the sum brilliance of the film.
What issues? First of all, the inconsistent tones in some scenes. You would expect that a film carrying such a grim premise would not be providing as much humour as this film does. Captain America delivers a serious address to the Avengers only for Rocket and Antman to respond with humorous remarks. I recall some moments where a very serious scene transitioned into a humorous one that completely disrespected what the previous scene had tried to establish. But like I said, a minor issue, mostly because the humour was restricted to the first act of the film.
And that brings me to my second issue, the first act. The first act had some incredible moments. Thanos getting his head chopped off was COMPLETELY unexpected and made for a truly icon scene. But after that, it went downhill for a bit. The pacing slowed down to the point the film felt sluggish. I remember in the cinema feeling as if I was pushing against a blockade in a river, trying to push it away so the river could continue running its course. It did not help that most of the scenes in the first act were revealed in the trailer so you felt as if you were rewatching instead of experiencing something new.
What else? There probably are a few issues here and there that others will pick out, but that's all for me.
Did these issues ruin the film? ABSOLUTELY NOT. The film was incredible. It's leagues above any MCU film. I am usually quite critical of MCU films (rating most of them as B-rated action films) but this was a great film. The last two acts were so utterly brilliant that they outweighed the first act. The execution was excellent and a testimony to the skills of the Russo brothers, each character was given their own moment to shine and develop, the plot served up many plot twists that diverted expectations, and God damn it, was it emotional.
There is literally no way you can not watch this film. Even if you're not an MCU fan. Just watch Civil War and Infinity War (that's all you need to fill you in on what's happening in Endgame), and then just watch it. Do it. It will provide you with a cinematic experience like no other.P.S: Another minor issue I had was the scene where all the females united. I'm all for female representation, but it was so clearly forced that it added for a :/ moment during what was one of the best battle scenes I've ever witnessed in film.",positive
"No doubt avengers ultimatum is a film with many hits but the hype of us marvel fans sometime knowing that thanos is going to die is fantastic.With the black widow dead, with the iron man dead for using the gauntlet and with the america captain killed by the robbery in time it was very sad but anyway marvel studios has a huge job ahead because it has to train new heroes and phase 4 promises and now knowing the pos credit of the film black widow, it is not known if natasha's sister will be a villain or heroine because I don't know much about this character that both appeared in falcon and winter soldier and now appeared in black widow but what she's recruiting people close to the heroes that's okay and for a good thing it's not.I will wait for the progress of this unforgettable story of the marvel universe.My final grade is 8.",positive
"This movie had so much riding on it, and it wins in every way, shape, and form. Avengers: Endgame manages to hold onto the comedy and drama the franchise is known for while being the most emotional film in the genre. In the theater there was an immense amount of crying, cheering, and laughing from the emotional opening scene to the absolutely epic and action-packed finale.Avengers: Endgame is easily the best film in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe and one of my favorite movies of all time.",positive
This best film to watch having high rating and box office being the highest grossing film. I watched it hall it was so nice.,positive
"Wow!!!!!!!!! I loved it!!!!!!!!! That is by far, the BEST MCU movie I've ever seen! I was really devastated when Natasha and tony died! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 But I loved the scene when Wanda fights Thanos! It was awesome! Everyone needs to see this movie! But watch the other movies before you see Avengers Endgame so you will be prepared. That's what I did. See this movie and remember, PART OF THE JOURNEY IS THE END!!!!!!!!!!",positive
"Off the bat I'm going to say I loved the film. It made me laugh, made me cry and felt like a proper ending to what has been an amazing saga! The final battle scene was simply fantastic (as you would expect) and it was probably the most well acted out of all the Marvel movies.That being said, I think I preferred Infinity War (I'll need to see Endgame again and potentially update my review)I loved what they did with depressed Thor, making him a fat drunk, it was funny and clever..... however, the fact that this god, the most powerful avenger remained that for the rest of the movie really irked me and the more I think about it the more it's annoying me. He should have got back to his usual self at some point before the end battle.Also, the girl power scene during the battle. I'm all for empowered women but it was quite ridiculous and felt like they added it about 3 months after finishing the movie, and for those reasons it loses 3 points from me 7/10.It could be that we've only just been spoiled with infinity war that I'm not giving this the 10 it could well deserve and like I say, I will watch it again in the next few weeks and reevaluate.",positive
Without the credits. The movie is 2 hours and 40 mins. The movie is boring at the start. It has a slow build up. It gets good..,positive
"It was a great conclusion to the Infinity saga but it lacked effectiveness for neutrals like myself. Only true fans will reap the full benefits of Avengers Endgame especially if they decide to look past the senselessness and predictability of the movie.Memorable moments are guranteed, however for neutrals this will be one of Marvel's most dissapointing films. It doesn't live up to the hype and it's way too predictable. Too many jokes, just the right amount of drama but not enough action.The best moments are the ones that make this movie slightly worth watching. If I had a blu ray of this movie I would skip to the most important moments because most of the film is pretty predictable and not very entertaining.Overall it was a good movie, but not one worth watching again.Spoiler : There is no post credit scene.",positive
"I am not a huge fan of the last Marvel movies. There are some very good movies, but the most is around average. Never so bad as most of the last DC movies. But Endgame is really game over for me.Please continue with X-men and guardians of the galaxy. It is enough for me. The rest I do not care anymore, it is ok like this. They professionally ruined it for me with Endgame.The story is very shallow, the solution is very shallow and also the action scenes are very shallow. Hours long they are busy with: yes we have something, but I have doubts, but it is great, but I don't know etc. And ofcourse all the heroes are very hurt and some are saying no at first, but already fast they overcome their hurt... And by the way: let's do some time traveling! Let's redo all the finding of the stones and snap the fingers a few times, it makes live so easy.So you have a 'big battle' where nothing happens and some action and after that it is saying goodbye to everybody. Oh wait! We forgot to think about a few death people, we just push commemorating them somewhere in the scenes. Iron man is the most important. Oh and captain Marvel is fixing everything ofcourse. I think she can save the whole universe on her own, who need the Avengers? And captain America has his ending: he is much older and guess what he did al that years? We do not need to guess because even that is explained, like we can not think for ourselves.Are there no good points? There was some humor and the graphics are looking good, but that is never the problem. And I see many people are happy with it, which I can not understand. But I do not need to. You can never make everybody happy, it is taste and interest. And for me this was a bad movie. Maybe the worst Marvel movie.",negative
"The best end for marvel studio movies, and best story and drama",positive
This is what all fans where asking for. It will hopefully beat avatar in box office,positive
"Marvel have done such a great job at creating a broad storyline, that pieces together like a puzzle. This truly is a Marvel fans fandream movie. It does sag a bit in the middle. Some characters are a little underwhelming, Thors storyline was dull. I did feel like there was more invested interest in Captain America, because the Russo brothers have already built that character up so much.But that last battle was amazing. It reminded me of the feeling I got when I first saw the final act of the Attack of the Clones, truly awesome!",positive
"I waited for years to see Endgame. After Infinity war the expectations were very high. As an superhero movie fan, the endgame were just perfect. I saw the movie many times and i still find it very good. One of the best movie ever.",positive
"No matter how it turned out, I would have nothing but respect for what the filmmakers behind the MCU managed to pull off in just over a decade. A slate of 21 movies sharing characters, themes and story-lines - connected by a joint goal to get the audience and the characters to one harmonious conclusion. After 2018, in which we got one of the MCU's finest films in Black Panther, and surely their most ambitious (at that time) in Avengers: Infinity War, the pressure for Avengers: Endgame to deliver on a decade of build-up and potential seemed like an impossible task.I can't help but think of what happened with Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. We started with a terrific punch of fresh air in Batman Begins. Then Nolan made what is considered by many to be the best superhero film ever made in The Dark Knight (it's not my personal favorite, but I do love it). TDK became one the most successful and highly-praised films of all time. Then the pressure - how could the third film in that trilogy possibly live up? The answer: it didn't. The Dark Knight Rises was a thoroughly entertaining, well-acted movie. But it was riddled with plot-holes and conveniences that contributed to a film that simply could not help but feel disappointing compared to what came before it.I say all that to say this: Avengers: Endgame lives up not only to its terrific predecessors from last year, but also the entire 21-film run that came before it. It serves as both a conclusion to and celebration of all the films that led up to it. It delivers on every single expectation (at least from this fan) and then exceeds them. It is as epic a film as the industry makes in this time, and there isn't a minute of the three hour run time I would shave. So many of the little easter eggs and sly moments from the past decade of these movies are called back in brilliant and inventive ways, while at the same time delivering something completely new.While I liked Infinity War, my biggest complaint was that the film's editing felt jarring. It had the task of juggling many story-lines (and I respect the monumental effort), but it seemed like it just shuffled between them too quickly - rarely giving us time to mourn for lost characters or fully soak in important events. Endgame completely fixes this issue. This is a master class in film editing and if the Oscars ignore it in that category come awards season, it will truly be a blemish on their continually tarnishing record. It does take its time, but in the best way possible. When characters face dark or emotional circumstances, we truly feel them. These are characters we, the audience, have bonded with for over a decade. And all of that emotional connection pays off perfectly.Another great highlight is that many characters who fans feel have been kinda left out the last few films get big and important story-lines in this film, finally moving from supporting players to huge plot-shifters. It's great to see so many great characters finally living up to their full potential.Everything else works. There's a reasonable amount of humor to balance out the heavy drama. Every actor delivers some of their finest (if not their best) work in this series. The special effects are phenomenal. Character design, production design, and cinematography continue to hold up the high standards set by other great films in this franchise.I really don't know how Kevin Feige, the Russo brothers, and their talented team of filmmakers and actors pulled this thing off. It's quite a feat. I go see a lot of movies in the theater as its my preferred viewing venue, and this is easily one of the most enjoyable movie-going experiences I've ever had. Avengers: Endgame begs to be seen in the theater. This is the masterpiece we were all hoping for. Kudos to everyone involved. 10/10.",positive
"Watched it in 4DX. Premiere morning.
This film makes me happy, sad, gives me peace and anger at the same time.
It's a new caliber of superheroes movie. 3 hours means nothing.As other marvel films, the sound, the effect and CGI is a top class.
Story wise, yes we will find some minor loophole, and yes, it's argueable, but I can't think of any major plot hole that can makes me hates this film. Especially it's a film that conclude all previous films.If you feeling happy, angry, sad or peace, believe me we are did.. and that's why this film is amazing and beautiful. A film that truly 11/10.
It's a no brainer if you think and feel the same as me.",positive
Not sure whether they were trying to be drama or action movie. Tried to build character development and hence made it too slow. In fact could have trimmed 30 minutes off the movie.The time travel bit was no surprise I guessed beforehand that was the only way they could get out of the situation. It was handled ok.Great CGI and action scenes.In the end I guess I was expecting more of an action movie than a character development move.,positive
"WOW! This movie is FANTASTIC in every single regard. I won't spoil anything because I'm not gonna be that guy, but WOW just take my word for it. EVERYTHING about this movie is done right! Thea cting is psot on. The effects are groundbreaking. The story is the one of the most clever stories I've ever seen. The action scenes will go down as one of the best action scenes of all time, FACT. The directing was perfect. The writing was perfect. Just...everything was perfect! Thanos is one of the best film villains in cinematic history! Josh Brolin will get a nomination for best supporting actor at this year's Oscars. I'm betting money on it! Robert Downey Jr may also get a nomination too. Is it feminine of me to say I cried a little bit during multiple parts of this movie? I'm not a liberal and I don't cry easily but WOW, this movie actually pulled at my strings a little bit and I give it mad respect for it! I genuinely think this film will be the one to win best picture at the Oscars in 2020. It will at the very least get a Best Picture nomination with other nominations in best screenplay, directing, actor, supporting actor, and every technical film nomintation like sound and effects. These movies are basically the Call Of Duty of films...they just get better and better, and we never wanna see them stop! GO SEE IT.",positive
"The movie was like a bad dream, almost like a nightmare of a Marvel fan, full of weird things who doesn't really make sense. I mean, seying Thor fat and having both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir, only in some fan's nightmare. Seeing Hulk and Banner as one, is also different. And Captain becoming an old man after he lived his lost life...",positive
"I have watched movies and rated them 1/10 without writing a review. But Avengers: Engame build up so much momentum with Infinity War and all that PR upfront, positioning A:E as the ultimate finally of the MCU that the failing of the movie is ultimately that - the sad finally of the MCU.Cinematography: Well done, good CGI as in previous films. Some scenes were shot to dramatic for the actual content of that scene but that's pathos (not a relative of Thanos) in American cinema. Some surprise moments that would are shot perfectly highlighting them (Captain America).Storyline:
*If you don't mind spending the ticket money please watch the movie and decide for yourself.*
Time Travel is a tricky concept with different approaches but there are some theories established and they simply make certain developments during or after time travel impossible / illogical. At this point, I can get behind Stark figuring out time travel with Quantum mechanics. After that the problems for that movie start...A) Illogic of time travel:
The group enables Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos to follow them into the 5 year future where he tries to grab all stones at once. This Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos gets killed in the future which makes it impossible and illogical for all the things happening from the time that Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos left his timeline, e.g. the Infinity War movie and all this Thanos did in his quest for the stones.
If Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos leaves his time (past) into the future and no Infinity War happens, Starks Timeline with a daughter also would not happen. Nevertheless, she keeps on existing after Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos is killed in the future. Zero logic.B) The handling of the stones:
Thanos has his gauntlet specially made in Nidavellir with the power of a star as all stones together hold all of reality. Now all it takes is Stark and some nano-tech to handle them and channel their power? Not realistic by the logic of the MCU explained before.
B.a.) For Ronan (Guardians I) it was almost impossible to wield one infinity stone and the Guardians barely and only survived by splitting the energy between them. The Hulk is almost killed but survives because it's Gamma Ray- okay. But that Stark simply can put on all stones and is not instantly ripped apart makes all previous told content irrelevant and makes this facet of the MCU ridiculous. It's a story line decision to kill of Stark for dramatic reasons but there would have been much better, logical ways. Other characters like a god (Thor) could have handled the stones by the unrealistic Iron Man gauntlet adopting to the persons hand.Over all, a white board, pen and a few hours would have shown the writers where the illogic happens and how to make it right in the sense of simple reasonable logic. This however is an unworthy end to the MCU and previous film.",negative
"Avengers: Endgame is more than a movie. In its three hours of projection, what is seen is a parade of superheroes and visual effects, true homage to the legion of fans who, since 2008, as in a great TV series, have been following the saga.Who is a follower of the Marvel Comic Universe on film screens, knows that after half of humanity and most heroes have been ""wiped out"" by Titan Thanos, bets on a possible rematch between the survivors and the possessor of the powerful Inifinity Stones was a matter of time.The remaining Avengers (Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Combat Machine, Rocket and Nebula), still without knowing the whereabouts of the Hawkeye, make a trip, with Captain Marvel, to the planet where the Titan is, where fight an unsuccessful battle for the recovery of the cosmic gems.Five years later, Ant-Man returns from his journey to the Quantum Realm, which began before the Thanos' crushing ""snap"", and finds a world totally devastated, with abandoned ships and cars, empty streets, and a memorial named after thousands of dead, including his. Her daughter Cassie is alive, but she has become a teenager.Realizing that he traveled in time, Ant-Man presents the idea to the Avengers, at first rejected for being unlikely, though not impossible according to Hulk. The scientist explains that when we travel to the past, this becomes our future, while our present becomes the new past.With Captain America and the Iron Man as protagonists, the team travels back in time, where they will recover some fundamental concepts to heroism such as honor, sacrifice and tragedy.The Avengers, as we shall discover over time, are susceptible to the strength of this element and, unlike what we have become accustomed to seeing in the old comic books, are subject to impermanence, as can be seen in the final battle, one of the most impressive scenes already seen on the screens.Among the losses, the saddest, certainly, was that of Stan Lee.",positive
"The fans of Marvel's fan in my country is amazing. We are treated a 24 hours round the clock screening but there are several improvements that can be made. I will write less spoiler but still include a spoiler warning.First, camera angles, some are too confusing and complicated. Make it still?
Second, a good idea to have a flashback(even a minor one) showing how the outcome of an event occured.
Third, don't show the place that simply too dark, we don't know who hit who vice versa.The best part? The battle and the appearance of the female's saviour (you know who)",positive
"I couldn't have hoped for it to be as satisfying as it is. After 11 years, the Infinity Saga closes with the ultimate showdown that the MCU could have provided. I'm honestly not sure how they can top it.Following the snap that concludes ""Infinity War"" with 50% of all living life in the universe extinguished, the remaining Avengers struggle to cope with their collective loss. Reunited with a couple of missing friends, the heroes come up with a daring plan, to collect the Infinity Stones before Thanos and return to their time, undoing the snap with one of their own and returning those lost.""Endgame"" is perhaps, the ultimate fan servicing sequel of all time. Shorn back to (almost) only the original Avengers, the film is then like a greatest hits tour, as the time travel element allows the characters to revisit past MCU highspots from another angle. The film also includes dozens of lines of dialogue from previous films, and dozens of visual or emotional call backs and pay offs. The amount of characters it services is masterful, with each getting at least one or two strong character and action moments over the run time. (Whilst I'm on the runtime, any concerns that three hours would be a problem are forgotten as the film flies by)It's not totally without flaws. It's a little laggy in its opening sections, and I'm not sure that the world following the initial time jump in entirely believable, but these are minor criticisms against a film that, with 11 years build up and 22 films back story, is more complete and rewarding than you could possibly have hoped it would be.",positive
"I have read a handful of reviews on here and not just the ones that highly rate the movie.The first thing I will say is I can see why the last Avengers has been split into two parts. I also think this is absolutely essential to consider before leaving your rating. It is my opinion that to truly enjoy this end to the MCU (for now) you need to carefully think about the film. Did you go to see the Avengers return to their former glory or did you go to see what was going to happen to Thanos? Ponder that question carefully!Without a shadow of a doubt the end of Infinity War is one of my favorite movie endings of any film released in the past 10 years. Who was sitting in the cinema expecting them to role the credits when the mad Titan had snapped his fingers and wiped out half of the Universe - did it come as a surprise to you? It shouldn't have, he told you he was going to do it and was way to overpowered to be stopped. Sometimes the ""bad guys"" are just too strong to be defeated by your favorite characters, sorry to disappoint! Cut to the first hour or Endgame, when Thanos gives his epic dialogue on the ""garden"" before Thor cuts his head off. Thanos was a no nonsense straight-talking super villain hell bent on his agenda. This is why he is one of the best written Villains of our time. We then find he is so good he even foils their time travel plan somewhat until the last 40 odd minutes of the film. I was truly on the edge of my seat wondering if he was going to do it again, when he got the stone again I honestly thought this was it and then of course Iron Man snaps him out of existence - which was indeed satisfying. You can see Thanos thinking calmly that ""its over"" he had failed, he then sat down and you could see his acceptance he has lost. ""You have my respect Stark"" - Thanos, Infinity War. He lived it out in his last few moments. Beaten and outsmarted.I went to this film because I wanted to see Thanos be beaten and I was not disappointed, he did not go down easy. I suspect a lot of us did the same. That is my review.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic masterpiece. The film expertly ties together the past decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, delivering an emotional and action-packed conclusion to the story of the Avengers. The cast is at the top of their game, particularly Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America. The special effects are top-notch and the film's pacing keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The directing by the Russo brothers is superb, they manage to balance the film's many characters and storylines perfectly. Endgame is a fitting end to an era and a must-watch for any Marvel fan.",positive
It's great but I don't like time travel plots as it feels like a cop out and they just reseted in a unoriginal and unintelligent way. I need this to be longer.,positive
I was just expecting more action... I was relatively bored for the first 2/3 of the movie.,positive
"More is not always better and a lot more is definitely mind-bogglingly hard to wrap one's senses around. After a slow build that effuses with emotional and relational devastation the movie thae turns towards a building resolution with multiple scenes of bravery and sometimes sacrifice. With so many super characters and subplots, its pretty difficult to really absorb the more intimate prolonged exposure that most dramatic movies offer. There are numerous attempts of pushing the audience's emotional buttons that abound in this superhero finale and in that effort there are a number of typical and well-execute ploys by scriptwriters to milk the scenes for all their worth. This grab bag of personas and dramatic and comedic turmoil all come together in a pretty full package that at times bulges at the seams. This is a movie that tries really hard to encompass the full panoply of the Marvel Universe which is likely too big for just one or perhaps two full length films to capture comprehensively or adequately. But nice, if impossible try.",positive
"The entire movie, as entertaining as it is, seems as though everyone involved was ready to be done with it all.The plot is unfulfilling. The inclusion of several characters seems forced.The action is satisfying, and everyone will find someone to cheer for.We're meant at the end, to weep for the grand conclusion. I weep for what could have been.",positive
"What the.... did Disney do? I know the wannabe cinema fan will be like ""that was a well deserved ending""... Like how? The story does not add up.. Really does not make sense... The solution to try save everyone is like xmen day of the future past concept ""reset button""The actors really Marvell this shows that Disney is loosing it with there political agenda? All the scenes she was in felt like a reshoot.. Like they had no plans for Marvell and it was forced!

"My spoiler free review of Avengers Endgame:
The best MCU movie. The theatre I was in went totally nuts. It had spectacular action, it was surprisingly funny, and emotionally captivating. It manages a large roster of well developed characters which are very well executed, everyone gets a moment to shine. Delightful throwbacks to previous outings as well as smartly placed pop culture references. A truly satisfying finale for the 22movie and 11 year story arc which we have come to love.",positive
"Pride of MARVEL ... thanks you Russo brothers for such great MCU ending, brilliant events and twist",positive
I was so happy yet sad with this movie. I have had days to process what I saw and while it was a great way to tie up the stories it is so hard to watch knowing that's it's the last time for some of my favorite Avengers. Looking forward to watching it again. Loved it 3000.,positive
"It would be impossible to talk about this movie without spoiling anything, but this is truly the Endgame. Avengers: Endgame felt like the closing of a chapter and the culmination of a decades worth of movies and a truly epic saga. We have followed these characters for 22 movies and it has all led to this movie, a combination of heart wrenching drama and epic action sequences.As a comic book reader/fan there really is something about seeing a movie like this that evokes a certain emotion in you, while I have enjoyed pretty much all of the MCU films this and movie and the first Avengers did something that is entirely on its own level. In the Avengers, seeing the moment in which the Avengers first 'assemble', there is a very emotional response. This movie has a similar moment that evokes that same emotion of seeing the characters you have known and love from the comics come to life on the screen. Endgame truly felt like a large comic book crossover event that ties everything together satisfyingly.While this film definitely has 'plot holes' and flaws, to me it is a 10/10 film because I truly doubt that anyone would be able to recreate the magic that this film represents, 22 movies in over a decade, this saga represents more than a single cinematic motion picture can accomplish but elevates the artform of 'film' and forges its own category of epic sagas.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is better than I ever could have imagined!!! A love letter to the past decade with so many Easter eggs, just an absolute joyride. The last half hour is a spectacularly jaw-dropping, emotional, goosebumps-filled piece of cinema unlike anything we've seen thus far!! (A forever Christmas gift for my 10-yr old self)Marvel closed this out by pitching a perfect game!! Just ... wow. This 22-film story arc has been an amazing ride! Thank you, Marvel and everyone involved with the making of these films! #ThankyouAvengers",positive
"Let's start with this, the plot has little flaws or plot holes here and there. And if you didn't watch a whole lot of other previous MCU films. Maybe this is not for you.For me, who watched every MCU movies ever produced. This one has it all.
A new take on hero movie, part of it like mission impossible. Very well thought out story. A hidden layer of means. Take its time to resolve many things, not rushing it.If Ironman I is a 10, this one is a 11.",positive
"It was good but IW was better. Reminds me of Kill Bill Vol 1, remember how good Volume 1 was, then they released Kill Bill volume 2 and it was anti-climactic and weak compared to the superior first movie. It does have some great scenes but they were few and far between. Movie had too much filler.",positive
"Even though I was able to predict the plot, this film was absolutely amazing. Incredible action, tear jerking & the perfect end to the Infinity Stone Arc. Only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was because 1 character I can't stand. Luckily they weren't in it much.",positive
"One of the main reasons why this movie is only a 7 is because of the super high expectations and how excited I was for this. So for me it was kind of a let down but not just because of the hype. Personally the pacing was just God awful, and it's not because it's a little slow to start, but it's the massive amount of jumps the film takes. I can watch slow movies with a build up, but when everything changes so quickly and then goes back to slow repetitively it creates an frustrating feeling. The movie also has many unexplained plot holes, with most movies this is fine, but when you need to know the details (which are very important for marvel films) then it hits the plot a lot. I also feel like the movie tried too hard to be emotional. There was no need for the way it ended or the sad spots in between. Not to mention, the cgi on captain marvel looks great. Still a good better then average movie, but not the best ever.",positive
"Fist I would like to say I don't generally love superhero movies. And I'm not really I big MCU fan and stuff like that.All that being said this was not a good movie.
It felt very predictable and formulaic the it was just like every other superhero film I've watched except a few with a few different villains. I thought they made the Hulk character really stupid. The he's not interesting if he doesn't get mad that's what makes the character interesting. Also the whole time travel thing didn't make any sense and just felt like other scenes and different movies.Then there were so many plot holes. Like isn't the timeline now all messed up? If you like action It's average. If you like story it's pretty bad. If you want something original you've come to the wrong place.",negative
"If you know me well, you will know I am not a huge fan of Marvel. But this film worked so incredibly well for me! This was the perfect culmination of everything from the past 11 years, and it was everything I want personally from a Marvel Movie, which is experimenting with different genres within superhero movies (I shall not reveal said genres as that's technically a spoiler). Everyone gives their best performances as their characters in the whole saga, even Jeremy Renner, who I do like, but I acknowledge isn't great, and neither is Hawkeye. But what really pisses me off, is that the MCU is still going. This was the perfect finale, but NO, Marvel needs some more dollar-dollar. But regardless, I had a great time watching this film.",positive
This movie was one of the best movies i have seen. i was very suspect of what was going to happen in the end and i was going to be pretty upset if it ended poorly. but it had one of the best endings. i'm going to start of by saying that i cried basically from the beginning all the way to the end. i've always been a marvel fan and i'm very sad to see them go. when the movie started and you got to see where all of the avengers were now 5 years after thanos it was the best. when thor killed thanos i thought it was kind of weird because it happened so quick and easy but of course he came back in the end to try and win. my favorite character is as Thor with a beer belly 5 years later. it was very fun to see thor as something other than a big muscle man that everyone oo's and ahh's over. in the end when tony stark out on the globe to erase thanos and his army and being everyone back to safety i knew he was going to die. i sobbed when spider-man was now the one hovering over iron mans body. i was also relived to see that captain america was able to go back in time and live his beautiful life with the love of his life. there is no more captain america because of course he cane back very old but the ending of captain america was one of the best. 1 more spoiler would be the ending after the credits. as you guys may know there was no end credit. but if you are a true fan and you stayed until the very end you heard THE sound. as soon as i heard i knew what it was because i had just watched the iron man movie the day before. it was the sound of tony stark making his very first iron man suit. this was the perfect ending the the perfect way to end the avengers. it's definitely a must see and maybe even a must see twice,positive
"After Infinity War I was worried about how Endgame would take the second half after the snap and I loved it. It was happy, it was sad, I laughed and I cried and I felt the characters and their stories went exactly where they needed to to. Bravo, Marvel!!",positive
This movie was something more than just a superhero movie. In this movie we watch the will of superheroes after been defeated by Mad Titan Thanos. This movie portrays the best 11 years of the franchise in perfect way. Please watch this movie as soon as possible.,positive
"I loved this movie, it beautifully encapsulated all the movies that helped build to this point, and rewarded the ones who became fully immersed by the infinity saga.
Tony's interaction and accusation of Steve after returning to earth, removing his chest piece and telling him to hide is absolutely fantastic acting.
Scarlets performance and character arc was amazing as she selflessly saves the universe and will go down as one of the strongest female protagonists on screen.
The Timeheist scenes are a great call back and I appreciate the time they took to explain the logistics of time travel and the effect on the existing and alternative timelines created.
The final fight sequence was amazing, and was a reward to see all these stories and heroes tied together for the battle. Beautifully shot and masterfully choreographed (for most scenes) to keep the action rolling; Ending with an amazing finished to each main characters arc. A terrific movie and a justified end.My only gripe of the movie is the corny all female fight sequence. If properly executed it would have been a perfect callback to the world black widow has opened for the women of the MCU. However, all women stopping in battle and lining up was completely immersion breaking. This happens with Steve in civil war with the helicopter and Thor and starlord in specific scenes, where pandering to the audience breaks the immersion by shoehorning in politics. Anytime these scenes come on in the theatres I'm in, the audience groaned because everyone understood what they were watching. If the women line up was dynamic and moving constantly then it would of been good but they stopped the action, took us by the hand and walked us through a political shift before returning back to the movie. With strong developed females like Okoye, Scarlett witch and Valkyrie (to name a few) they don't need this level of pandering, it undermines the message of their strength and independence of men.",positive
"The movie starts slow and depressing, however after sometime a solution comes into view and they do it amazingly.
The graphics are amazing and the ending couldn't be more satisfying.",positive
"Endgame and Infinity War are pretty much on the same level in terms of entertainment. And that level is not very high. Look, there's no magic. The first Avengers movie had it along with many of the other firsts in the group. But that magic has gone away. First off, please don't hit us over the head with the emotion hammer. You did this by trying to lengthen out shots where characters look into the distance... for 10 seconds OR look at each other and hug 5 times. What was 3hrs could have been easily 2.5hrs with a little slice of that here or there. Overall, you're seeing the film for the characters you love... you're almost forced to if you're a comic book fan. If you're not a fan - don't bother.",positive
What a way for Phase 3 to end. Its crazy that you have waited so long for the movie that you have waited for all your life.,positive
"Endgame is a fun movie to go see, it has its problems but is a fun movie. These reviews on here giving it 10 out of 10 and saying that is the first perfect movie are 100% wrong. Dont go in expecting this movie to be better than godfather or citizen kane as these reviews describe. It's a fun movie with fun action, no it's not an oscar contender, no it's not a ground breaking never before been done movie, and no it is not a 10 out of 10 perfect movie. Go in expecting a fun watch with some cringy comedy and you will enjoy the experience. But dont listen to the people saying that this is a perfect movie, or the best ever made.",positive
I'll just keep this brief. This movie is thoroughly overrated. The first act was a drag. The final fight left a lot to be desired. And don't get me started on fat Thor 😑. I've been a fan of marvel forever and this was such a let down for what was promised,negative
This movie was an excellent film that fulfills expectations and maintains a serious tone but doesn't fail to make you laugh. In the audience there are audible cheers as each character is revealed and tears among all audience members as the sad inevitably happens. The bad reviews often overlook the culture and environment this film gives easy 20/10,positive
"I LOVE THIS FILM SOOOOOO MUCH. ONE OF THE BEST AVENGERS MOVIE IN MY OPINION.YOU SHOULD WATCH IT. PEOPLE WHO SAYS THERE IS A LOT OF EXPLOSIONS, FIGHTING AND STUFF LIKE THAT< IGNORE THEM.That is how the film is meant to be. It is an action film like what would you expect if it is an action-packed film!!!!BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KILL IRON MAN :(My fav superhero.",positive
"I love this movie so much
It's just so good
The portals scene is absolutely amazing and the ending is really sad",positive
"Well, Russo brothers did it again. Those 3 hours felt like half hour or less. After watching this story reached its end, I really must say - there is no movie universe like MCU. I love DC and other superhero movies also, but after seeing Endgame - everyone (and that includes future Marvel) really must try hard to beat this 10 years long story and I hope that it will happen again. A man can hope, right?If you read any comic book that has really good story with real stakes (every hero can die) that spans over years and you reached its final number, climax of it all and you are blown away by it - I'm sure you will recognize that feeling while watching this movie (especially in the final GREAT scene, but I don't want to spoil it to you).When I came home from cinema, I needed another ""shot"" of our heroes so I immidiately watched first Avengers movie and Avengers: Age of Ultron. But that is not enough: today I will watch Infinity war at home and Endgame once more in cinema.Than you all for a great movie(s)!Avengers - Assemble!",positive
"Finally got to watch the most anticipated movie, the saga that continued to never cease to amaze us from 12 years. I had never seen a movie like this until today. I have sore my throat during the ending. I don't want to spoil it so please must go and grab your tickets.",positive
"Alright, the movie is quite as expected, very enjoyable, yet the continuous messing with time ruined it a bit
The plot was quite confusing and the unprecedent deaths made it even more,
The ending gave it a huge plus in my personal opinion perhaps for my over attachment to peggy's story, despite that the ending itself was the most illogical messy thing, it was supposed to be a different timeline not the same so even if cap left to it he's not supposed to appear in the original timeline, but hey it's just a movie after all not really a quantum physics lesson and the ending was the most beautiful thing not just in this movies but the whole series,
One should rate movies as movies not anything else and as a movie Endgame succeeded worth-ly in a way and sadly in another one must say not because of lives loss but also because of the ending of a great film series that we shall certainly miss.",positive
"Time travel? Really? Beating Thanos should have been more complex than some Quantum science theory. I wish all the hero could bleed more, suffer more, and win more rather than lost 2 of their pioneer. And what an easy hunch about the time travelling. Its twisting and turning but Infinity War way more better than this. And we lost capt marvel, the man-hulk and potts-rescue pin point storyline. Some jokes are really good I admit it. But..we are talking about Thanos, if u want beat him that easily just by doing Timeheist theory, then our hero should have more problem bigger than snapping the infinity gauntlet and everything back to normal. To be HONEST, i was really happy and yell ""YESS!"" from my seat when Thanos get his hand on the gauntlet one more time, because i hope, there will be another hero combo's between Dr. Strange & Capt. Marvel, or Black Panther & Ant Man etc etc etc. The pace also as an issue here, its okay to have a slow drama cinematic timeline (last time I got from Harry Potter last eps)
Conclusion, whatever Infinity War the score is, Endgame will always stay below it. Im sorry, its disappointing, REALLY! And im sad because i wait for too long for this",positive
What more could you ask for?This movie is epic.,positive
The movie has a slow two hour start. The time travel thing was a bad idea. The end was good and saves the movie from receiving a six rating.,positive
"So a handful of heroes fight all the way to the climactic end of the movie, and then they lose the chance to finish what they started. I am not going to spoil it, but watching a million CGI characters appear on both sides was like letting all the air out of the tires. All the dramatic build-up was lost when it became a billions against billions battle.Which brings up the fact that at least 90 minutes of this movie is spent on boring scenes of various Avengers feeling depressed about the death of the heroes, and going to support group meetings. We get it. The Avengers are depressed. This could have been covered in fifteen minutes or less in a group meeting. We did not need to follow each Avenger through their depressing trip down memory lane. Thank God Ant Man came back from the quantum universe and got the ball rolling!!Unfortunately, Thor becomes the punchline for jokes throughout the movie. Since Captain Marvel is the new #1 hero, they had to power down Thor by turning him into a drunken hobo. The Incredible Hulk has spent the past three movies (Thor Ragnarok, Infinity War, & this one) in permanent erectile dysfunction, and he continues to be a zero in this movie. Thor and the Hulk are just here to be the focus of comedy as has-beens. Even Bruce Banner as a scientist gets slapped down. Michael Douglas and the Pym Particles have to fix what Bruce Banner fails to do. It is a very sad way for two of Marvel's earliest and most powerful heroes to end their game.There are a lot of good moments in Endgame. Most of them happen when the small crew of Avengers is trying to find the original gems. Then the battle when it is just the small group against Thanos is excellent. It was building up to a great ending, Captain America & Iron Man defeating Thanos, against all odds. Even Thor was redeeming himself in the battle! That is how this Marvel Comics masterpiece could have ended. But they had to throw in the billions of CGI characters and turn it into a big circus act... Too bad. Less was more.",negative
Love the new Hulk. The 22 films were tied up nicely in a bow.Nice nod to have Jon Faverau at the end - he started it all,positive
"I will not waist time on too many details, most of them are already said in other reviews. However, I have to say a little something about Thor - I can see that many didn't like his appearance in this movie, but those people have to understand how broken he was. It's not just the fact that he lost his family and half of what was already left of Asgard, he had to deal with tremendous guilt- because he could 've prevent it all if he just went for the had or the arm instead for the chest. Can you imagine living with that kind of guilt? That what we've seen in the movie is a text book definition of depression and a person being in denial of it. I love Thor and I hope it gets better from here, but I really like how he was presented in this movie, because it's a little bit more realistic than most of other things.",positive
"You know a film is good when it manages to make three hours absolutely fly by. 'Avengers: Endgame' does this in spades, making its gargantuan run-time seem as fast as a snap of the fingers. While it is properly pacy, this doesn't mean that it's a constantly moving, action driven piece in the same vein as its predecessor 'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018). Instead, it's a much more character focussed, dramatic film and in my eyes it's all the better for it. While 'Infinity War' was great in its own right, 'Endgame' feels like a completely different beast all together; the two are undeniably separate entities. The characters have always been what makes the MCU stand out and 'Endgame' arguably has the best character work in one of these films to date. Rather unusually for a picture of this ilk, it is focussed more on that than any action or spectacle, both completing arcs from the entire franchise and establishing new ones in itself. Each of the core players are focussed upon greatly here, which is extremely involving, especially to long-time fans of the series. That's not to say that the film is devoid of any action at all though; it comes eventually and is very much worth the wait. The third act action sequence is probably the most satisfying moment of the entire franchise and proves that Marvel knows how to stage these things very well, while still keeping a keen focus on character. There's also a lot of fan service throughout, but this hardly a bad thing at all. Being able to reference even the lesser known and liked films of the franchise and trust that the majority of the audience will be able to understand is something that Marvel wears with pride here. 'Endgame' is for the fans after all and it never forgets this, yet (unlike 'Infinity War') there's enough groundwork laid out here to make it really work on its own as an individual story, too. Overall, it's an outstanding conclusion to the 'Infinity Saga', satisfyingly wrapping everything up, making it feel like a definitive 'end', yet still leaving you excited for what's to come (the MCU isn't going anywhere any time soon). It's big-budget blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best and one of the greatest Marvel films to date. 9/10",positive
"Look... i get it. You have to pay service to the fans, because this is the conclusatory film. This film called back previous characters to nod at them, and tidy up any loose pieces. In fact, it did these things well. I have no objection to the approach there. But.... thats ALL this film is. Its one of those bonus features of extra content that doesn't really bring anything new to the table . Its well done... they spent money on it, but does not move the needle.Defeating Thanos was anticlimatic, because not much effort was spent on fight choreography, but rather was spent on the writing to have brought them back together in the first place. The whole time machine thing was literally the biggest plot point, and because its impossible, they had to gloss over the science specfics in the script... hence we're left with the biggest plot point being pretty hazy and far-fetched. There was no fight in the film that i can even really remember. Captain America fighting himself was cool for about 10 seconds.All in all, just didn't feel like a movie to me, with any narrative structure. It was like a reunion special, or a bonus feature.... existing soley to wrap it up and put a bow on it.... I DO like what happened to everyone. I think it fitting that the patriach Iron Man dies. I've always felt that putting Captain American back in his own time was proper. That was cool. And i also liked Cap giving the shield to a black guy, metaphorically presenting the concept that America is for all people. That was nice. The movie, as a whole? Forgettable. Not excited to ever watch it again.",positive
"Endgame is the pinnacle of what is possible for the comic book genre, the 10 year infinity saga comes to a emotionally satisfying end. And is easily one of the greatest films of all time, it's an experience you will never forget and a film that will never be forgotten.",positive

"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.",positive
"This could've been sooo much better, some great scenes and then the horrific route taken with the characters of Thor and Hulk! Some nice touches and fight scenes but left disappointed.
Totally agree with so many others that infinity war was the better movie.",positive

"After the disaster of the last film. It is time for revenge, retribution, and redemption for all on board.But really they put all the movies in the twenty two and tried to squeeze it in three hours there. If you can sit there and not go to the restroom.Action packed but the plot is a bit weak and confusing. As you need to watch the other films to get up to date here.As all of in the Marvel characters come to with one goal....defeat the main antagonist Thanos. It is including not just the Avengers of Iron Man, Captain America, and ThorBut with Spider Man, Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr Strange, etc. It is a bit confusing to cramp it all down. But give credit to the special effects, action packed, and C.G.I. making up for it.",positive

"This is an edit on my first review where I talked about how I loved it more on my second viewing than my first, but over time I now think more about how my Dad took me to see the star wars movies and the Indiana Jones movies and how that was my childhood. I took my kids and I hope that when they grow up the avengers theme is what the star wars theme was for me!My Dad has passed away and my regret is I couldn't show him what he showed me.I can take heart though knowing that I've now replaced my Dad in the scenario and hopefully passing on the same memories with my kids.Take your Dad man, you'll be forever grateful.",positive

The Avengers endgame was a great picture of bringing all the Avengers together help restore the world in the universe total sense of normalcy. Robert Downey Jr Chris Evans Chris Hemsworth Gwyneth Paltrow and many others made this a great movie and highly recommended for fans of the Marvel franchise.,positive
"It's hard to criticize Endgame, given its enormous success. It certainly had its moments, the scene with Hawkeye and Nat was incredible, and the closing scene was really cool, it really made the viewer feel like he was part of the Marvel pantheon. But I wouldn't be in any hurry to see it again, and I watched Endgame 4 or 5 times. I've heard the latest Spider-Man gets the Marvel universe revved up again, so that will be fun.",positive
"Loved it! Made me tear up many, many times. The cast did amazing!",positive
Ehh it was predictable and the last one was better,positive
"First of all - this movie had to be brilliant to back up all the hype and legacy from earlier films. So is it brilliant? No, it's not even close.Second of all - Endgame just isn't a very good movie in any noteworthy sense, outside of effects and really good action scenes. And this brings me back to my first point. Perhaps this formula would work during the rise of comic films, but I can't see this film as anything but a huge disappointment.After a brutally emotional opening scene, that I have to admit - is really good, Endgame then proceeds to jump from scene to scene with inconsistent tone, pace, and development. A serious movie can have great humor, but the way Endgame uses slapstick humor, and non-serious characters is, well - silly. Is this a serious movie or not? Many of the films rules or conventions are openly broken to serve secondary storylines, and much of the 'science' is just plain dumb. I can suspend disbelief and get into stylized movies, but so much of this movie just comes off shallow and not really well thought out.This includes the story arc that to me has little natural flow. Many comic movies today seem to come off more as bad, incomplete TV episodes that rely on being part of a series for relevance. Movies should never be like that, and Endgame felt to me like three TV episodes jammed together, with three to five tac-on false endings.While I really liked many of the action scenes, which are clearly well conceived and beautiful to watch - at this point action scenes should be a given, and the story should have the same excellence. I don't feel like I'm being to picky when great movies in the Marvel universe exist (Dr. Strange for instance). I don't consider Infinity War one of them, but it's a heck of a lot better than Endgame.To me, outside of the opening scene, all the emotional moments fall absolutely flat. Considering the conclusion of Infinity War - there is a blatantly obvious sequence that should exude the epitome of joy. This part of the movie is hard to explain without giving spoilers, but in my opinion - this sequence is the writers biggest failure of the movie. The reunions are not well executed.Objectively, this movie probably deserves a 6 for production values, great action, and resolving the Infinity War outcome. But subjectively? I really thought this movie kinda sucked.",negative
"First, let me say I've been an MCU fan since the beginning, so this review is from that standpoint.To everyone bashing the use of time travel: So what? The writers deliver a twist in the first 5 minutes of the movie when Thanos reveals that he destroyed the stones and then loses is head. Soooo...where else did anyone think the movie could go other than time travel? To the writers' credit, they used time travel differently than most other time travel movies that I've seen. They're not trying to undo the snap or make it so it never happened. They're just trying to get the tools they need to fix it. So if you're at the movie because of time travel, I suggest you watch it again and really pay attention, particularly when Hulk explains what they're doing. Plus, the writers didn't only use time travel to achieve an objective, but also gave us some nice character development and resolution on the way.I'm also seeing a lot of people complaining about the first act and that the whole movie is too slow. Well, maybe, but there's a reason for that. The MCU has been trying to show audiences that there are consequences to our heroes' actions/failures (Civil War, anyone?). The movie picks up 5 years after half of everything was dusted. The writers and directors took the time needed to show what the world was like now and show that the characters really haven't moved on from the Snap. They didn't want us to just see it. They wanted us to feel it. Personally, I did.A lot of reviews are saying this movie doesn't make sense if you're not a MCU fan. Um...duh? No point addressing it beyond that. Go watch the rest of the movies.I've also seen people say that Thanos is different and not as relatable in Endgame as he is in Infinity War. Again, this is on purpose, and after watching the commentary, it makes sense. Thanos in IW is more of a philosopher, 2014 Thanos that we see in Endgame is a butcher. He's not supposed to be likable.A note about Fat Thor: at first, I didn't like that he didn't transform back into the fit, muscly Thor we expect. But the more I think about it, the more I appreciate it. There's plenty of explanations out there about it, so I won't explain it all here, but it can give you something to think about. It's actually really great character development.Do I think the movie is perfect? No. Captain Marvel is a cool character, but I felt that she was used as a fix-all when the writers ran into a roadblock. Her finding Tony and bringing him back to earth was fine, but then she was conveniently absent until the end of the movie when they needed a good way to destroy Thanos' ship. And then after all of that, she still couldn't offer much of a challenge to Thanos himself. That was pretty weak and inconsistent writing. Also, I've nothing against strong female characters or the ""feminist movement"" (which I don't think really applies here but that's what everyone else who doesn't like it says), but the scene that highlights all the female characters felt a little forced.Endgame strips down the 22-movie saga and focuses on the original team. We see our favorite characters come full circle and find the resolution they deserve. It is sometimes heartbreaking (Iron Man and Widow), sometimes satisfying (Cap), and sometimes in unexpected ways (Hulk and Fat Thor). It nearly perfectly wraps up the Infinity Saga while still leaving the door open for more stories. I haven't seen Spider-Man: Far From Home yet but I'm excited to see where the MCU and various Disney+ series go from here. 9/10",positive
"This is a historic movie. The story that Marvel and Disney crafted for over a decade comes to its conclusion in an epic 3-hour film that is for the ages.All the characters, some of which we've known and loved for years and others we just met, get their share of love and their time to shine, with cheers and applause ensuing several times. There were tears aplenty, but also quite a few laugh, in particular from a character you don't usually think of as comic relief. The movie takes time to show us the unbearable loss of Infinity War and how the Avengers each deal with it, before a way to bring back all of the victims of the Snap appears. But don't think you know how this is going to go because whenever you think THAT was the big twist, there's probably another one coming.New abilities are revealed, emotional arcs are fulfilled and heroes change as Marvel lays the ground work for its next phase that will officially start after the release of Spider-Man: Far from Home this summer. Endgame ends with an open door to the MCU's future, but for the first time since its beginning, the movie does not feature a post-credit scene, leaving us wondering what's to come.I feel like this is the kind of movie I'll be happy to say I saw in the theater the day it came out 30 years from now when they remake it for the third time. This is a once in a generation cultural phenomenon and I hope you go see it in the theatre because you will not regret it.",positive
It did a great job wrapping everything up but at the same time it's hard to have the same emotional impact that Infinity War delivered to the table.,positive

"Endgame was a great way to end an amazing 11 years. I loved every second of it. Usually I'll disagree with some moments, but in this one, I loved every single second.",positive
Avengers: Endgame was a fantastic movie that paid off 11 years of set up. It has so much that the fans always wanted to see and also managed to surprise a few times. It had humor and heart in all the right places. An excellent send off for some of the characters we've grown to love over the years. If you'd told me that a movie like this could be possible back in 2008 when Iron Man was released I'd have thought you were insane.Apologies for the short review but I'd have to see it again before doing a deep dive. In the meantime all I can say is 10/10. Worth the wait!,positive
"The first 2 acts dragged out too much, they could cut about 15 min. But the worst part is that the 3rd act is predictable, but with great moments. I really thought there would be some kind of surprise, but there weren´t. I wished I loved this movie so bad, but I was so disappointed with the film. It had great moments but also much meh moments.",positive
"I have been with Marvel for the past decade and have loved their movies. After watching Infinity War, I was devastated. End Game is even better than that film in every way. I won't spoil the movie for you but I can assure you that you are going to love every single moment of this film. There are so many epic moments that you are going to witness. You will laugh and cry every now and then. It is a wild ride from beginning to end. It reminded me why I love movies.
Just go and watch it on the biggest IMAX screen possible, if you can get the tickets.",positive

I was very excited to see the endgame and when I saw it, i was surprised to see how boring this movie is and it was waste of time. Infinity war was much much better than end game. This movie doesn't even deserve a rank in IMDB and still people are mad for this movie.",negative
"It was DEFINITELY better than ""Infinity War."" It was so good, it didn't even FEEL like it was three hours, and I didn't need to use the bathroom. So funny, action packed and kind of emotional. Since it has passed ""Avatar"" in the box office, it should have an Oscar nomination for ""Best Picture.""",positive
"Decimated and beaten. With all the dust settled (sorry) from the end of Infinity War, this is how Avengers: Endgame begins for earth's mightiest heroes. After 21 previous films and 11 years building to this point in the MCU, the expectations for Endgame are undoubtedly huge and theories on how they will conclude the Infinity Saga have been running wild.After Thanos (Josh Brolin) wiped out half the living population in the universe, what's left of the Avengers must reassemble once more to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe.It's near impossible to discuss the narrative of Endgame without spoiling the film for everyone so the best I can do is that Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have done a great job in giving the film three distinctive acts. Each act offers a range of different emotions but all three of them together combine to make a superhero film that really does define exactly what an epic is, working as a love letter to the entire backlog of MCU films and their audience in the process.The Russo brothers, who have been at the helm for, now including Endgame, four of the very best MCU films, really do deserve all the praise they get for how they handle the roster of characters on show. Being the culmination of the Infinity Saga, there are some huge moments that provide such a satisfying pay-off for anyone who's been majorly invested in these stories and characters, like myself, since Iron Man back in 2008. The brothers know how much these characters mean to some so it's great to see them ensure a rousing finale is provided for all to sit back and admire.The action is rather subtle for the first two acts but it's delivered amongst some fantastic callbacks that feel deeply nostalgic, even though they're only from within the past decade. There's a number of brilliant surprises along the way that brought out nothing but a feeling of sheer joy. It's when the film reaches it's third and final act where things reach such a level of crowd-pleasing fan service that I couldn't help but let out a few screams. Trust me though, I wasn't the only one. It's as big as expected, particularly on an IMAX screen where the film really does flourish, and there's one moment in particular that floored me, a shot that will go down as one of the greatest in the superhero genre.Coming to the performances, Endgame really does belong to the original six members of the initial Avengers cast; Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner. With a film juggling so many characters, these six get the majority of screen time and Downey Jr. and Evans are the two major stand-outs in Endgame, both giving possibly their best performances in their respective roles. Hemsworth continues to deliver on the comedic aspect of Thor while Ruffalo brings probably my favourite iteration of the Hulk within the MCU to life brilliantly. Johansson and Renner have always felt like the Avengers no one really cares about however, I think things might be about to change because they get a real chance to shine in this one.Outside of the original six, the rest of the cast (and what a cast) just suit their roles down to a tee. Paul Rudd has a larger role than I thought he'd have and that's a good thing because the man just brings the entertainment factor to the team that feels different to what everyone else brings. Josh Brolin returns as Thanos and, while his presence isn't as impactful as in Infinity War, it's great to see the performance of an actor like Brolin brought to life through the motion-capture wizardry that we know looks seamless enough now to not hinder a film.Accompanied by Alan Silvestri's brilliantly rousing score, Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic event for the ages. Not only is it the closing chapter of a 22 film arc, it's a celebration of what makes these films and their characters so special to the millions that have supported the MCU since its inception back in 2008 with Iron Man. It's a sprawling epic that will make you laugh hard one moment before reducing you to tears the next, and if that's not enough, even the end credits are suitably epic for such a triumphant finale.",positive
"Keeping this spoiler free which means I can't really say much about anything. If I could sum it up, it would be... however prepared you think you are for what's coming, you're not even close. But it is blockbuster cinema at it's finest.The story and the characters are faultless. It's funny as hell, particularly the first half.
The action may lack but that's because this is a movie about the characters and the journey that's brought them all this way. It's probably the closest a blockbuster will successfully come close to an indie drama.The 3 hour run time does wonders, giving the movie, it's plot and it's actors and it's directors room to get very creative and pace it's emotional arks and it's complex story.If there are flaws, it's in the fan service, which runs extremely high (too great and small effect), causing some logic to wane and an inconsistent tone during important moments. Characters are shorthanded but if you expect anything less, you're expecting a 10 hour mini-series, not a single movie (3 hours or not).Given the scale, this is actually very well structured and entirely, emotionally walloping. Not just because of the 11 years of movies that came before it (though that helps).
There won't another quite like it for some time.",positive
I can't believe how well they did this. My expectations were so high and yet there is nothing I would change about it. Im seriously speechless.,positive
"Although we all cried for Iron man, this was the necessary ending for this phase. It hurts, I know, but Avengers will countinue. At the end Tony was the hero, Nathasha the best human being ever and Cap got his deserved life. We cried, we laugh, such a good, intense and satisfactory three hour experience.",positive
"It is any movie you could ever ask for. It makes you smile, it makes you cry, and it makes you laugh. It blows your mind and is completely unpredictable. It's all you could ever ask for in a movie. It is the greatest end to a franchise and will be remembered forever.",positive
"So much wasted potential, even though the actors performances were flawless and the overall movie wasn't bad It just didn't live up to the expectations, the whole time travel senario was ruined by one simple phrase ""if we change the past that doesn't affect our future"" felt like they chose the easy way out, you cant have such a cool superhero like Thor being portrayed by an excellent actor and humiliate him like that you just cant.",positive

"SPOILERS Ahead!!! Turn back now!!Endgame brings MORE plot holes and nonsense. How can this be??Part One of the Avengers movie (Infinity War) oozed into theaters in Spring of 2018. It was not what I expected and I was pretty vocal in my dislike of the film. I stand by that review.Spring of 2019 brought us Part Two (Endgame). I motored over to my local multiplex and plopped down to watch and be amazed. As I sat munching my popcorn before the feature I kept thinking. ""It's going to be okay. It's really going to be okay. It can't be as bad as the first film. It's going to be okay.""It was NOT okay.How is it possible that this film is even worse than Part One? That should not be possible, right? But it is. I'll attribute most of the 'bad' to the fact that the movies were shot simultaneously. For some reason the whole Betty Botter tongue twister is rattling around in my head. I suppose because the Russos needed some better butter to make their bitter batter better. Evidently, they couldn't find any.Because the 'batter' is bitter y'all!So many things went wrong here. Let's start at the beginning. We spend the first hour of this snooze fest in a never ending loop of 'where's waldo' to catch up on some of the folk that are left after Thanos snapped his fingers and killed off half of life in the universe in Infinity War. Stark is floating in space with Nebula running out of oxygen and food. Everyone is depressed. Thor is super depressed. Enter Captain Marvel who brings Stark and Nebula to earth. Does she stay to help? Nope. She flies off to help other planets that don't have an 'avengers'. Whoa, wait...I thought she was supposed to save the day, trounce Thanos. I thought this would be her moment. No? We have to save the world and find Thanos on our own? Huh! The team decides to find Thanos, take back the stones and reverse the first snapping. Thor whacks off Thanos' head when they learn Thanos destroyed the stones and there will be no do over.The snooze fest continues 'Five Years Later'.Ant Man escapes the quantum realm (plot hole...cos how did he do that, exactly?) He finds Black Widow and Captain America and explains that he's only been gone 5 hours 'cause 'time moves differently in the quantum realm.' (say what?) Captain America is leading a 'touchy feely' grief counseling encounter group with one of the directors (Joe Russo) providing a cameo as a grieving spouse. This was our gay moment that we were promised and it almost slips by unnoticed.Moving on.The group approaches Stark to do the time travel reset. He initially blows them off because he has a life and a kid. However, he puts all that to the side because of the loss of Peter Parker. We gotta have Spiderman back because his next movie is in the pipeline. Bruce Banner and the Hulk have found the peace Jekyll and Hyde never did and are happily signing autographs, taking selfies and blissfully not remembering that Hulk wussed out in Infintity War because Thanos kicked his green butt. Thor is living in New Asgard in squalor with his buddies Korg and Miek, drinking copious amounts of alcohol, porking up on snacks and developing a substantial beer belly. Hawkeye has turned into a vigilante and is systematically wiping out bad guys to avenge his family and improve the world. Yeah, whatever works.The whole 'stone heist' segment of the film was like a bad version of any of the Ocean's movies except all the bad that went on was not thought out ahead or planned. In fact, the movie jokes about the improbability of time travel by referencing a ton of movies (from Back to the Future to Star Trek) and saying 'that's not the way it works'. One problem...they never really explain how time travel 'really' works because nothing in the whole process was consistent. Do you or don't you interact with your former self? Maybe, maybe not. Will all be returned to its 'pre Thanos' snapped' glory? Not really. Will all our favorites come back to life? Ehhh...not quite (Loki and Vision are not brought back and I'm STILL upset about that!) Will what you do in the past change your timeline? Depends on what you want to do? What happens if you decide to stay in the past or your past self comes to the future? Why quibble over minutiae? Plot hole after plot hole opens up and we're supposed to just swallow the blue pill and believe whatever we're told...however cockeyed that may be.Captain Marvel does come back to take out Thanos' ship and join with the other women (in a heavy handed obligatory feminist moment that is so contrived) to do battle with Thanos and keep him away from the glove. I had hoped that this would be Captain Marvel's moment. I thought she would put on the glove, snap her fingers and we'd all go back to business as usual. But no. She makes no attempt to put the glove on herself. Really?? Tony Stark uses his tech to transfer the stones from Thanos' glove to his, snap his fingers, and turn Thanos and all his minions to dust. But...but...we had been lead to believe that Captain Marvel was the pinnacle of super heroes. Guess Captain Marvel didn't get that memo. So why did we even need a Captain Marvel origin story? We could have had a Black Widow origin story. We were already invested in her character. Plus Scarlett is a better actress than Brie. She just is.What is so frustrating is none of this is a surprise. Not one thing. We know that Steve is going to stay with Peggy. We know that Black Widow is going to sacrifice herself for the Soul Stone. We know the effects of the first snapping will be successfully reversed. The Russos telegraph every single plot point (and I use the word 'plot' loosely because there wasn't one). The dialog was so basic that I found myself speaking it before the characters did. I hate when that happens because it's never a good sign in a first-run film that I've never seen and which I did not Google or read a single review.This film was a monumental waste of time. I waited ten years for this. I waited TEN years for THIS??
I rated the movie a '3' because I got to see some old favs. I was glad to see Rene Russo as Frigga. Loki, of course and the Strike Team leader Rumlow.I'm sure this movie will make a ton of money. Most Marvel films do. I usually see each of the films in theaters more than once. Not this time. I'm done. I will not give any more of my hard earned cash to this effort. Not one penny more. Neither should you.",negative
"Just go watch it! It is worthy! Captain America, Thor, Everyone!!! And Tony.. omg.. 😃 best movie made by Marvel!",positive
"Everyone knows Endgame. I would rate the film as follows1. Characters 10
2. Acting 10
3. Plot 9
4. Cinematography 10
5. World building 9We have stellar characters and acting that you could rate 11 with Tony Stark, Spiderman, Thor, Ant man, Captain America, Black Panther but we also have other characters that are more an 8-9 with Rody, Hawkeye, Vision, Scarlet Witch, but overall that's a 10 I have to admit.However, the plot could be a tiny bit better and the film feels a bit too long, so plot only gets a 9.",positive
"Man.. that was absolutely amazing.. well done.. i'm speechless, best movies ever..",positive
The movie is fine but is very overrated. The first 2 hours are so slow and boring to be honest. This movie only amazed marvel fan's. The 8 out of 10 is more than deserved.,positive
"Went to a late showing last night and wow!!! This movie was amazing!!! Loved the plot and overall look of the film. The cast was amazing as always especially Chris Evan's, Chris Hemsworth, and Robert Downey Jr, they went above and beyond in this movie. You will laugh, cry, and yell in excitement over this film. Definitely Marvels Best!!!!!",positive
"It's funny it's a great movie with great reviews and is highly successful, overall. But, the trolls are coming out to play on imdb today, boy. It tied up previous loose ends from past films, it had a good story that was inventive, fun and clever. It had many easter eggs tied to past films and movies and is a great superhero film and a good film, period.9.4/10",positive
Great movie But not better then infinity war. Ending was the best part of it,positive
"The Avengers: Endgame...a true comic book masterpiece! You can't get any better than this, a perfect finale to The Avengers series.",positive
"It also has several plot-holes... They need to hire better script writers, since plot-holes like this are very easily avoided, yet they can ruin an entire franchise's continuity (which is exactly what has happened here).Thanos snapped away half of all people right? To solve overpopulation right? Because his planet & people suffered from overpopulation right? SO WHY THE HELL would he then do what he did with the stones, in just a few generations the population of the galaxy will be back where it was and more overpopulated than ever? It's the most stupid plot hole ever.Another HUGE plot-hole: There's NO WAY that a human could wield a single Infinity Stone, never mind all of them at once so that blows a huge hole in the whole last 30minutes of the movie and all future movies, since what happened is impossible. A human would die instantly if they wielded that much power.Hire better damn writers!",positive
I.ll be brief and say some spots were amazing wont spoil but there were times that just totally ruined it ... Captain Marvel and her im the best dead pan delivery was horrendous...and THOR lol wtf happened to that very very poor showing of a bad ass charater who deserved way more then this ..same goes with HULK... was a delight to watch but no way does it capture the pacing and character development of infinity war .. and that battle scene will go down in marvel movie history as one the best epic finales to a movie EVER.... SNAPPP...,negative
"Before seeing this movie I was super excited, but a little nervous. I had no idea how they were going to pull off wrapping up a franchise this big, but they nailed it! I don't think they could have done better with this movie. It was thoughtful, every main avenger had an important character arc to wrap up their story and the fan service was done perfectly. This movie made me appreciate some of the other MCU films that I didn't like as much, like Thor the Dark World. I was stunned at some of the little details that they remembered and brought full circle from the other films. All the characters endings made sense and were extremely satisfying. Also, the final battle was by far the best battle I've seen in any superhero movie. This was more than a film, this was an experience. I will never forget seeing this movie for the rest of my life. It's one of my favorite memories. I truly don't think the film industry can ever pull off a feat like this again.",positive
"I saw this film 4 times in cinema, that just says how good it is. I am a huge MCU fan but even for someone isn't as big of a fan, you can still see how this is a special movie, no wonder it is the highest grossing movie of all time so far.Where Avengers: Infinity War left off, the remaining Avengers are left crushed, grasping onto any possible idea of trying to bring their friends, families and others back from their decimation.For me, this is the most unique film in the whole franchise because it deals with problems that hasn't been seen in the MCU before. All hope was lost, Thanos was killed after the remaining Avengers found out he destroyed the Infinity Stones.The amount of foreshadowing, call backs and references in this three hour long ride was outstanding with some of the most epic scenes ever seen on screen. Captain America wielding Mjolnir had everyone jumping in their seats, the portals sequence had everyone screaming along with the famous line 'AVENGERS, ASSEMBLE!'. To top it all off, all those emotions were crushed when Tony Stark saved the universe at the cost of his life.Many opportunities for future MCU films have been opened up from this film and many people need some time off to process this masterpiece.",positive
This is everything I needed from Endgame.a Lot of people who only watched it for the hype won't be able to enjoy the movie as much as we Marvel do. It gave the characters the ending they deserved and oh my God that last fight scene is a freaking masterpiece. I don't think any movie will ever make me feel the way I felt while watching Endgame in a decade.,positive
"Definitely a must watch. It's extremely entertaining and emotional throughout. One of the best marvel movies ever made. Although the time travel thing was not really a unique idea, endgame is still a fun to watch more than once. Great acting, great cast, great visual effects, this whole movie is just epic.",positive
"This is the 2nd time watching the movie for me. First time I watched it in theatre. Tony got really skinny. Babyface Steve looks better. Even after everything Thanos has done to her it looks like Nebula got a bit sad when Thor killed Thanos. I like how the movie starts with a more serious tone, seeing the characters dealing with the loss of their loved ones, without unnecessary jokes. ''I love you 3000'' has to be one of the most adorable lines I've ever heard in a movie. The Noobmaster69 joke is still funny.I really cant believe that these time travel suits are cgi, they look so real. To me the time travel in Endgame makes no sense, I prefer the classic time travel we've seen in other movies. Thor meeting his mom again was wholesome. Natasha's death was so tragic and heroic. Both were willing to die. Having them fight each other was so smart. ''I think it worked'' and then BOOM everything gets destroyed, love this scene. The scene with all the ''Avengers'' coming back has to be one of the most epic scenes in CBM and cinema history, the fight scene after that too.The scene with all the female avengers was pure cringe. Also they make Captain Marvel look very overpowered. While I can think of different ways that Ironman's story could end, I think that what we got is decent. So no funeral for Natasha but a funeral for Tony? This doesn't feel right. About the way they ended Steve's story my reaction is meh... Also making Falcon the new Captain America, why? He was great as Falcon, no need to change that. Overall I think this is just a bit better than Infinity war. More serious tone, less goofiness. Good direction, writing, cinematography and performances.My rating is 8.3/10.",positive
Very hardwork nd very nice movie nd so smart tony stark,positive
"Going into Endgame I was expecting every character that disappeared at the end of Infinity War to come back, probably via time travel (because of Dr. Strange's experience with it and the idea of alternate universes etc.), and one or two main characters to die. These things happened for the most part, and I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but I was really hoping there would be some part of this film that would really blow me away/catch me off guard but that wasn't the case.It was a solid ending to the Avengers saga, but nothing more than that. You got what you paid for, and all of the stories of each Avenger were concluded but that's all this movie really was. It was inferior to Infinity War but still a very entertaining film and made the run time feel like only 2 hours instead of 3.",positive
"Amazing, 100% the best MCU movie by a country mile. Everything you want plus 1,000,000 extra amazing bits",positive
This is a superhero movie. It doesn't deserve a 9.3 rating. Better than Godfather? Shawshank? Are you kidding me?It belongs at 7-8. Rated 6 to adjust for voter stupidity.,positive
"A long and boring sleep fest that ruins the 10 or so years of build-up for a few key characters and is filled with more plot holes than there are superheroes in this cinematic universe. The final 30 minutes of this long journey is about the only part, aside from a few touching moments, that is worth watching. Quite a disappointing ending to such a praised saga.",negative
"Endgame will and always be my favourite superhero movie they way the put an end to certain characters is so emotional 😭😭😭steve finally got to live his life that he always wanted, tony got to say a goodbye to his father and much😭😭.",positive
"It could definitely be improved, but every possible flaw can be totally overlooked because of the 22 film build-up, it seems earned completely for every joke that doesn't land (which isn't many) there are a hundred fan-service moments that make you forget any wrongdoing
Following up such an airtight film like Infinity War would be superbly difficult, making the 11 years feel worth it is an achievement and The Russo Brothers deserve praise.",positive
"""Endgame embodies a satisfying conclusion to an eleven-year-old franchise, it is exceptionally deepened when concentrating on determined characters such as Steve Rogers, Tony Stark and Hawkeye. Still, it is under the weather in some features, for example, regarding action scenes and some baffling-undeveloped subplots""It has passed nearly seven years since I went to the cinema to watch The Avengers with some classmates to celebrate my friend's birthday, the end result was purely adrenaline-charged. If someone had asked about living the same sensations at the fullest the following decade with the MCU, my immediate response would have been an instant ""nope"" because I never ever distinguished a franchise which lasted more than a decade in the history of the seventh art. Today, if I had the chance, I would ratify my answer. Endgame does embody a satisfying conclusion to an eleven-year-old franchise, the finest news is that it surpassed almost every single Marvel movie to the point it joined, in my opinion, the top10 list of the best MCU flicks to date. Mainly for three main reasons: I) An Emotional Farewell: Marvel has produced to date more than twenty movies which had a strong bond between each one, the continuity presented, the fun cameos and the mutual action pieces are melted in one single movie whose name is Endgame, probably it becomes the last movie you will ever meet your favourite characters. II) The Characters Development: Over the years, within each superhero solo movie, we came across with own personalities from each member of the Avengers. Yet, in the fourth Avengers instalment, the feelings run high because it represents a unique encounter with the most beloved people in their lives (like Tony with Howard, Steve with Peggy, Thor with Frigga) and it turns out to be some of the most heart-warming scenes of all the MCU. III) The Epic Final: After fighting the almighty-badass-titan Thanos, the Avengers assembled once more. The fact they are willing to fight in spite of not having all of their members and the probability of winning the match out of fourteen million possibilities makes it special because in this case, they are willing, as well, to sacrifice their particular lives. The final battle is stunning not only for its remarkable visual effects but the action pieces and the ensemble of all the superheroes, making it some of the greatest ones from all the saga, as outstanding as the one in Civil War, Infinity War and a couple more.Nevertheless, it displays some faults which can infuriate some viewers. To begin with, there is the under the weather action scenes and some underdeveloped subplots, take the example of Loki with the Tesseract, the moment where Thor goes back with his hammer (WTF happened then in The Dark World?), Cap vs Cap (amusing but confusing) and many more examples. I know it brings back some Back to the Future essence but it just keeps driving us up to the wall. In addition, the only memorable fight was the final one and the brief but impressive Stark-Cap-Thor vs Thanos, then for the first time I can assure the formula exchange brand-new genres because the movie exhibited drama rather than action spectacle.Apart from that, just spot the closest cinema possible and behold this superhero masterpiece. (83/100)",positive

You had your expected comedy from a Marvel Studios film, but man when it took a turn, you were in for the ride of your life. I laughed, I gasped, and yes, I cried...a few times. Real tears. So emotional. I'm not sure any range of films could have or ever will culminate in anything close to this. Kudos to the actors who we took this ride with over the last 10+ years and of course to the Russos.",positive
"Just saw so called and talked this movie. It is just hype and to say truly it is a movie that marks below previous Marvel movies. Because after seeing this movie your mind will be empty and you will be not satisfied with whole drama feeling that something was missing, yes thrill of superheroes is totally missing here. Reasons are following as me, others may have their own different opinion than me, but me, watch the movie only for full of entertainment with not much expectation. High rated tickets should give you full value of your money and three hours of life. High ratings are false and all are copying to support only for this average movie.
Reasons are many;
1. The starting of last chapter is very slow and dull, whereas it needs some powerful actions or at least interesting incidents to keep viewers connect early to the story.
2. Hawkeye lost his family, how? And why not he lost himself ?. ( Thanos spares him?)
3. Planning to time robbery with quantum theory is very slow and time consuming only.
4. It takes too long time to start the real drama cum fight.
5. Time robbery is so confused. It is not cleared that how lost heros came return in life. What is that method was been applied not shown anywhere.
6. If Thanos is vanished by Iron man then how he will regain again to finish some superheros as shown in Infinity War ? Is there any paradox theories? Not cleared by director. Various time lines are so confused7. In this such a big saga of returning our lost heros into life, what is the role of Nick Fury as he only show his face at final scene. As me he must have a major role for planning the time plan.
8. There is only a single fight, first and last with not impressive only lengthy and boring.
9. Such super movie must have solid logic plot and here Infinity War was better.
10. Nothing new plot. I actually wait till end to happen something different.
11. Captain Marvel has no significant role here even her character was created with a single separate movie to enter in Endgame?
12. Thor is shown drunkard with tummy belly. It is not acceptable as our hero is our role model. I actually feel shame to see such nonsense thing.A very few things are good like CGI work, father of Iron Man, Natasha's sacrifice etc for name. Hulk's anger on footing stairs is just hilarious comical sequence. I really enjoyed it.Acting is okay and no one expect good acting in such comics movies.As me the movie is watchable but not for much entertainer. It is only deserve 7 star. And lovers of Iron Man and Natasha, don't be disappointed they will meet you in future because it is comics universe.",positive
"Ignoring the girl power escene, the movie is perfect. Avenger Assemble!",positive
"First off what is it with Disney making everything so generic and bland. Sorry but you have a franchise so big with so many characters that ""vanished"" and what do you do with them... well not to give it away but Cher's song comes to mind, why because that's the only thing you can do silly! The only problem with it is it takes the non vanished ones like 45 minutes to figure this out. The rest of the movie is spend getting the stones with of course the epic battle in the end. I don't have a problem with this as it is a typical big budget movie that will probably break even more records through the course of time, or at least until the next big movie comes up in this crowded theaters. What I liked was the part of Thanos and his daughters, yes it slowed the pacing down a dat but it was emotional and meaningful. I also liked the humor, except for the Hulk being half Banner and half Hulk... it's like the executive is ok just throwing out what it means to be these various characters. The ending was also sad saying goodbye to some of the characters... some died others passed the torch to other ones which is where I have a problem. Sorry but for some it's regrettable to have a character be replaced since they really didn't need to (Captain America living a full life only to return a old man and passing the torch... with more of those red viles needed to turn back time couldn't he just go back in time again and remain CA?) all I can think of why they would do this is for being PC and/or to save Disney 20 million bucks a picture. There were other PC moments in the film, like in the epic battle there has to be a girl power moment out of the blue and it goes nowhere ... once again it's fine just too obvious. It's not a bad movie but also not worth the universal praise it is receiving either. I like the marvel movies and this one is no exception. The story just needed a bit more than turning back time and finding the stones. There are a lot of what happens next in the next films and I hope they do other things with Marvel post Stan Lee.",positive
"Endgame is a much less interesting and visually engaging movie than Infinity War. I don't understand all the crazy hype and 8.8 on imdb is stupid, this is why I'm giving it one star, to mitigate the stupidity.As everyone expected, remaining avengers use time travel to try to fix things, yet even for a marvel movie the time travel science is confusing and ridiculous, as well as shown in a very boring way. I've seen low budget movies that had better grasp on the scientific, logical and visual aspect of time travel.The whole point of endgame is to resurrect the fallen avengers and other trillions of creatures across the galaxy, yet while doing it avengers end up losing irrevocably even more important members of the team, and the whole thing looks ill-conceived.A lot of time is spent on meaningless conversations, while the devastation Thanos caused across the galaxy is barely shown, negating the past and current sacrifices of avengers.I left Infinity War wanting to see how the story ends.
I left Endgame feeling that I should've waited for it to come out on Netflix.",negative
I think that the movie is realt good but it is so sad that many dies and for example Tony Stark dies and that is so sad but I think is fit very well that he dies so this movie gets a 9/10.,positive
"MY GOD!After the jaw dropping cliffhanger Avengers Infinity war left us with, I didn't know how the Marvel films could get any better. But they did.",positive
"The film opens with Clint Barton on his family farm about to have a picnic just before the Snap of Infinity War, and he's left alone as his family mysterious disappears into dust. Yes, it's as heartbreaking as it sounds. We cut to Stark and Nebula aboard the Milano after twenty-odd days in the void of space, hopeless and running out of essentials. Stark has practically given up when Captain Marvel appears and carries them back to Earth. The post-credits scene of Captain Marvel never actually features in Endgame, and I feel like it was ultimately something too important to leave to another movie (oh look, my first criticism). Chronologically Barton's family gets dusted, jump forward a couple of weeks when the Avengers have Fury's pager trying to work out who it's calling when Carol Danvers appears. Presumably they persuade her to back into space to try and find Tony. It's a crucial piece of the early puzzle to make sure everything flows, and it was left out. Redundant after Captain Marvel? Maybe, but it would've been nice anyway, just to keep Endgame complete.From here the Avengers fix up the Milano and fly off to confront Thanos, a now broken and frail man living peacefully off the land. In the first real subversion of expectations, he offers them no fight and he's promptly dealt with, less than half an hour into the movie's runtime. So where does Endgame go now that it's villain is dead with two and a half hours left to go?! The Quantum Realm of course! Don't worry I'm not going to give a running commentary of the whole film (because hopefully if you're reading this you've seen it already anyway), but with the infinity stones destroyed, they hatch a plan to go back in time, steal the stones before Thanos ever has them, and snap half the universe back into existence. Of course things go wrong along the way, people die, others are dragged into the mess, the plan has to be improvised, and it all culminates in a monumental battle comparative in scale to Return of the King.Now I'm going to get this off my chest now as it's what I'm most keen to talk about, and that's all the callbacks, references, and cameos. Oh my god the movie is full of them, and each one surprised me for a number of reasons. Once the Time Heist begins, we are of course thrust back to the events of a number of previous MCU films. We go back to the Battle of New York in Avengers, we go back to the beginning of Guardians of the Galaxy on Morag, and yes, we also revisit Thor 2. To avoid referencing these movies in these scenes would've been impossible, the but the opportunity is also used to drop in some other movies and events. The Ancient One from Doctor Strange appears, Jasper Sitwell, a SHIELD agent all the way up to Winter Soldier appears alongside Crossbones (as well as Cap standing in a crowded elevator with them all to boot), we see Starlord singing and dancing to himself on Morag, Thor has a tender reconnection with Frigga, Edwin Jarvis from the Agent Carter TV show marks the first crossover from TV to film, but the one that really surprised me was Alexander Pierce. Freaking Robert Redford came back for a cameo! Then there's all the additional cameos elsewhere, and alternate aliases too (like Hawkeye being Ronin, Banner and Hulk living together as Professor Hulk, and Pepper Potts finally taking up the mantle of Rescue)Seriously, this movie has possibly the craziest castlist ever assembled for a single film, and every single one of them slays it. The vast majority of them get stylised credits as well making for a special moment in lieu of an actual post-credits scene, with the original six Avengers literally signing off from the franchise. I admit, I choked up a bit at this point. Nothing made Endgame feel more final than those credits. So here's a little game, I'm going to list every actor I remember seeing, and you've got to pin them to a character. But also, this will display just how crazy this castlist is. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L Jackson, Brie Larson, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ty Simpkins, Cobie Smulders, Josh Brolin, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn, Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Benedict Cumberbatch, Benedict Wong, Tilda Swinton, Don Cheadle, Danai Gurira, Chadwick Boseman, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi, Tom Hiddleston, Rene Russo, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Tom Holland, Marisa Tomei, William Hurt, Robert Redford, Frank Grillo, Hayley Atwell, James D'Arcy, John Slattery, Natalie Portman, Linda Cardellini, Ross Marquand, Callan Mulvey, Yvette Nicole Brown, Hiroyuki Sanada, and of course Stan Lee himself. For anyone counting, that's nearly twenty academy award nominees.All right, I think that's enough raving for a minute. Let's kick back for some ranting, because Endgame still wasn't perfect, not in my opinion. The biggest one for me (which is still comparatively a niggle) is how it contradicts itself on time travel. Time travel is a huge part of Endgame, and they explain it away nice and neatly, without risk of confusing things or retconning previous film entries. Going back and changing things doesn't affect the current timeline, the timeline of our characters, the timeline we've been following all along. Instead every change creates a new, separate timeline. There will be a timeline where Thor loses his hammer for a brief moment during the dark elves assault on Asgard, there will be a timeline where Loki escapes after the Battle of New York with the Tesseract, there will be a timeline where Thanos and his armies just up and disappeared around the events of Guardians of the Galaxy, there will be a timeline where Starlord doesn't find the Orb, there will be a timeline where Howard Stark got advice on how to be a father from a ""stranger"". But most crucially there will be a timeline where Cap and Peggy grow old together. A completely separate timeline. This is where Endgame breaks its own rules, as an old Cap appears just sitting on a bench nearby. For starters why did they decide to set up the time travel device in order to close the loops near some random old guy on a bench? But more importantly how is there an old Cap there when the timeline he went back to would have diverged from the current one? We didn't need a whole monologue about living his life and literally passing the torch over to Falcon. It was redundant, didn't make sense to the film's own logic, and in a way undercut the emotional punch of Cap's eventual fate right at the end of the film.It also creates problems, moreso than anyone else, for Spider-Man. Half the people on the planet are five years older. In adults this isn't quite as noticeable and life goes on, but for Peter he's just a teenager. Five years at that age is huge. Cassie Lang is now a teenager as well when she was just a kid during the snap. Half of Peter's friends will have grown-up and left school, gone to college, maybe even moved out, have jobs, and started paying bills. If Far From Home doesn't address this, we're going to have some problems. But that aside what are the odds all the major characters of Spider-Man were all snapped and will come back exactly as we expect them? That just feels way to convenient!Cap v Cap was amazing, as was the ""I can do this all day"" exchange between them. The constant references to Winter Soldier were amazing, what with Pierce and Crossbones back, as well recreating the elevator scene, Cap whispering hail Hydra (in reference to the comics), and of course Sam saying ""On your left"" to Cap as Doctor Strange opens a whole bunch of portals around him. Then there's Cap wielding Mjolnir after causing it to nudge in Age of Ultron. All things considered, Cap had an exceptional send-off in this movie. Tony had a lot of great things too. He got the family he wanted in Infinity War, he finally got Pepper to embrace the suits and become Rescue, he was sent off with his ""heart"", the mention of cheeseburgers made made me want to blubber like a baby, and even Harley from Iron Man 3 made a brief appearance! In fact Age of Ultron got a lot of nods as almost every single element of Tony's vision was met; the broken shield, the Chitauri worms, space, Black Widow's death.Thanos was great too. Early on you can see the toll the stones had taken on him. He was a shadow of his former self, basically succumbing to his fate. When we go back and meet younger Thanos at the height of his ambitions, he's so much more menacing. In a way he sort of reverts back to being a generic superhero villain who just seeks the end of the universe, but he's in full Mad Titan mode before Gamora's betrayal in Guardians of the Galaxy, and we've seen how capable he can be even without the stones in Infinity War. Now he has a double-bladed sword-glaive thing and it's awesome!Yeah, Endgame was pretty damn amazing. It was the perfect culmination of everything. It sent-off our original heroes with the most perfect endings, and gave each and every one of them a moment to shine, accommodated heaps of fan-service without getting schlocky, and gave the bittersweet conclusion we as fans needed. It took us in directions we never expected, no matter how rampant our theories and rumours became, no matter how hard the trolls of us tried to spoil it for everyone else. There's so much in this movie, but it never feels rushed, and it's three hour length never drags or feels too long. It's not a perfect movie for me, it never will be, and if I'm honest Infinity War is still my favourite film of the entire saga. But all-in-all I couldn't be happier. I give Avengers Endgame well-deserved and emotional 9/10. Godspeed!",positive
"I'm a marvel fan and was so excited for this movie, even went for the first day first show but the movie disappointed me very much. I won't be wrong in saying thatthis movie is worst marvel movie.
It had no logic. First of all the concept of time travel was very childish and the story was unable ti explain he different timelines properly which resulted in many big flaws.
Just for instance the present nebula killed the past nebula. So my question is how the present nebula came into existence if there wasn't any nebula in the past?
This is just one of the example I'm mentioning, there are many of 'em.
So overall I'm not at all happy with the movie",positive
"Never have I heard so much cheering in a movie. Also, there was a lot of tears from grown men. Not myself of course, but being a huge Marvel fan, I mostly knew what to expect. I've loved almost all of the movies leading to this, and this did them justice. Many great heartfelt moments, some good action and of course they always sneak the humor in somehow. Even my wife loved this, and she's stuck by me for most of these. I hope it breaks all the records, and I can't wait to see what direction Marvel goes next with whoever that may be.",positive
"Absolute greatness done by marvel
Everything about it is amazing",positive
"The movie had an epic tale and fights and humor like you would expect in a Marvel movie....butThis is a spoilerWhen the people are brought back, they bring them back 5 YEARS after they left and I presume they ended up in the exact same spot.
If 3.5 BILLION people were to suddenly materialize there would not be enough food, shelter or ability to deal with them. The entire world economy and welfare would self-destruct.After 5 years many people would have moved on...married other people, moved away changed jobs whereas the people 'coming back' would have nothing since they would have probably been declared dead.What about someone coming back into their old bedroom only arrive while another couple (who bought the house from the estate of the person who vanished) were having sex.What about people who vanished from cars on the highway. Did they return only to be run down and killed?That flaw ruins a good story for me. I expect a bit of stupidity in any movie to fit a script to a story, but this one was too glaring to deal with.",positive
"The only way to explain this movie is ""Cognitive Dissonance"". Its foundations are fundamentally cracked with the best plaster covering it.The Good? Most of the Characters are given satisfactory closure and/or sequel-fuel, in particular Tony, Cap, Thor and GOTG. The Visuals are amazing and breathtaking. Actions Scenes have large pay-offs for series veterans. Highly emotional and atmospheric.The Bad? The film introduces too many plot threads, then it is attempting to close pre-existing ones. Some of the humour doesn't work. Thanos lacks the development that IW gave him.The Ugly? The main plot gimmick is non-nonsensical. Thor is just awful.",positive
It was good. Just like the last one. But it's not very different from any marvel movie. They have become repetitive and predictable . Many cliches,positive
"No Spoilers
This movie epitomises why I no longer pay to go to the cinema. It must be a free ticket and I must be bored. Those are my two criteria. It is therefore quite ironic that this film is boring. Was I not clear in my criteria. I said ""I must be bored"". NOT I want to see a BORING film! I quite enjoyed Infinity Wars to some extent but this film was just plain stupid. It must have been written by the children of the directors. It's that bad. I tried to tolerate this film as much as possible, started falling asleep then pinched myself and thought, ""what tf am I doing here?"" and walked out!",negative

"It feels like an eternity since the bald, purple alien madman Thanos (Josh Brolin) assembled his impressive gauntlet with all of the infinity stones and snapped half of our universe out of existence. It was a bold move by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors Anthony and Joe Russo, and although there were many fanboys in the crowd who knew beforehand that what they were seeing was essentially the first part of two-act structure, the sight of many beloved superheroes dissolving into nothingness was a shock for those who had never read a comic-book in their life.It's actually only been a year since Avengers: Infinity War, but the secrecy surrounding the plot of Avengers: Endgame (the title was only revealed a few months ago) has kept audiences desperate to see how the remaining heroes will react to their failure. The main question hanging over Endgame's head is how they will handle the devastation left over by Infinity War, and whether certain characters who met their demise last time around will in fact stay dead, or, as is the case in the comic-books, find their way back into the story via one of various means (cloning, parallel universes, time travel, etc.).Without spoiling anything, Endgame establishes quite early on that there are indeed irreversible consequences to Thanos' victory, and no amount of magic or technological advancement can set things back to how they were. The decimation happened, and those lucky, or unlucky, enough to be left behind are forced to deal with it. Those that didn't fall victim to the snap consist of the original Avengers crew - Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), who we find drifting hopelessly in space with only Karen Gillan's Nebula for company.There's also Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, an integral member of the crew and surprise no-show in Infinity War, who perhaps has more reason than anybody to avenge the loss of half of all life. The sight of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) disappearing before our eyes may have been shocking, but Endgame's opening scene pulls the snap right back to a personal level. With his family gone, Hawkeye adopts a new persona and has taken it upon himself to take out criminal organisations Punisher-style.As the trailer pointed out, people find a way to move on, but our heroes don't. Bolstered by the arrival of uber-powerful hero Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), the gang - along with Don Cheadle's War Machine and Bradley Cooper's Rocket - head into space to make Thanos pay for what he has done. Naturally, things don't go quite according to plan, but when Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) - previously believed to have been a victim when in fact he was trapped in the Quantum Realm - re-emerges with Pym technology and an ambitious plan, the Avengers are handed a glimmer of hope.I'm deliberately leaving out specific plot points for fear of spoilers. This is a three-hour film, but every second counts in some way to moving the complex plot forward or explaining the mind-bending mechanics at work. While Infinity War barely paused for breath, Endgame begins on a sombre note, before launching us into a breathlessly exciting second act that serves as both as inventive way for our heroes to stand a fighting chance, and a celebration of Marvel's ground-breaking 22-film, 11-year spanning arc.The third act, a colossal battle between the forces of good and evil that is almost too overwhelming to comprehend, throws lots of fancy effects and punch-ups at the screen. In most other big-budget epics, these climactic smack-downs are when my attention start to wander, but here they are involve characters I have watched evolve over the course of a decade and have grown to love, and when that Alan Silverstri score kicks in at just the right moment, the heart-flutters are inescapable. I'd also be lying if I said I didn't well up on multiple occasions. After all, we knew contracts were up and we'd be forced to say goodbye to at least one of the original heroes, but the future also looks bright for Marvel. For the moment, until Spider-Man: Far from Home arrives in a couple of months at least, Endgame is a near-perfect way to wrap up 11 years of storytelling and character-building, and a warm thank you to the fans who have been there since 2008.",positive
"Since 2008, films not only from Marvel, but also from adaptations of comics in general, have been redefined. Marvel was just a second division DC (and a lot more childlike as well) until it released the movie: Iron Man (2008) so yes, Marvel humiliated this unsightly brand of comics, and there began the best film franchise ever made in Cinema's history.The universe was developing focusing on the development of each character, the studies and character arcs in each film are masterpieces in themselves, but the films themselves were even better. Each film was more fantastic than the other, the ""worst"" film in the saga in my opinion, The Incredible Hulk (2008) is still excellence in its most efficient and graceful form. It's a cinematic orgasm to watch anything from the MCU, but when we put the pieces together and complete the puzzle ...The Avengers, 2012. The pinnacle of art cinema, the epitome of quality in cinema, a film that was truly good as hell and was marked as a landmark that will remain forever in our hearts. Watching something as surprisingly good as that unbelievably good movie complements totally truly laute of everything that makes a movie really very capable of dissenting the emotions of the human condition so good to be good. Who doesn't remember watching that more than perfect movie in 2012? What a movie ... It brought together everything the MCU had already done well, put together and did the impossible task of overcoming! There are no words that describe the masterpiece that is The Avengers. There are many things to be written here, but the review is not even for this film.From there, several other excellent films were released, including Civil War and Winter Soldier. Of course, they were really GREAT, but not as perfect as Avengers.Since everything is going this way, Marvel was risky and decided to give a part of the conclusion of this epic and magnificent story. They wanted to make an adaptation of the Infinity War comics, which could have been bad. But Marvel being Marvel, never lets them down.Infinity War was not only the best film of 2018, but also a great candidate for the best film ever made in history. A voracity so much better done than anything, that it becomes incomparably the best in history. I don't know where Marvel gets its infinite quality, but for God's sake ... This movie was really the best, masterpiece in a way that no movie seems to even have a chance to be at least something close to something as indescribable and hugely exciting as IW. Was the intuition to make a perfect film? They did it, definitely. Divisor of waters in the genre, and put The Dark Knight to suck. WOW.But Endgame? Don't get me wrong guys, but which movie was better than Endgame? It's so sad and weepy, Endgame is the best movie ever made, and NOTHING will be better. There, i said it. A tremendously spectacular film and cathedral where all scenes work like Endgame, not winning an Oscar was a big joke. How is a totally ridiculous movie like Joker better than that? Who is Joker near Endgame? Not even the Gods of Cinema can do something as good as that. It is not only the film of the century, but also of history. The time we are all stunned by this masterpiece of art. Better than all books, if you understand. I love it so much, and I'm glad my favorite movie is the best in history. Endgame is flawless, it's the best cinematic experience I've ever had, it's stronger, brighter, more agile and smarter than other films. This movie is worth gold. Godfather? Citizen Kane? Vertigo? Seven Samurai? No, Endgame. This film is an opera. Best of all, always.",positive

"Starting many years agoe this saga began, on a journey of true extraordinary characters and storylines. Not all of them were great but they all held a beautiful story to a bigger story.I can go on writing on all the wonderful and lovely parts of the film and maybe pick a bad place e here 'n there but it's not needed. This is a genuine and beautiful story on people we've had the joy of following for a decade. This is an emotional roller coaster that will brace every part of the viewer. If you're in this hero-worls then you owe it to the industry to see this movie. I did, I cried and I recommend you to see it as well, it's goddam amazing!Thanks for everything Stan.

"Hear me and rejoice! Prepare yourselves for a Marvel movie hitherto undreamt of before!This movie has it all! Not only does it deliver on every level you expect it to, it even delivers on levels you weren't expecting. Every character from every Marvel movie is represented and gets their moment. Being the ending of Marvel Studios Phase I, expect some sad goodbyes and a massive battle sequence for the ages.Although a major league sci-fi action superhero spectacular, it has some of the more affecting smaller moments ever seen in a movie of this type. It's a real love letter to the fans, but it makes you wonder if they'll ever be able to top themselves again.I had to wear my 3D glasses out of the theatre because I was too teary eyed.A few questions:Does Pepper Potts in the suit have a superhero name, and is it Iron Lady or Iron Potts?Why didn't Hulk and Gamora get more scenes together? They're both lean, mean green fighting machines!Did Captain Marvel get her hair done in outer space, and if so, where, and by whom?",positive
I'm glad to get to the finale of these movies and am probably done with marvel. They're good popcorn movies but there isn't any staying power in my mind. They're all too similar. This one ended alright though and had some good scenes. That said the captain marvel just running through a ship crap annoyed me. Also when she had the stones all the women showed up randomly to protect her as if this huge battle wasnt going on and they just happened to be in the same spot. There was a little less jokes here which I like. If it's a pretty much end of the world situation I dont want all the jokes. Pick a tone. Overall though I'm happy to have finished it.,positive
"What can I say, Epic, emotional, shocks and twists.... No one is prepared for this. The movie felt like 1.5 hours even though was 3 and could have gone for another hour and still flown by. You will need to watch multiple times as a lot happens that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and to process everything that goes on. The ending credits are different to pay homage to the cast and to signal end of an arc spanning 11 years.
This movie deserves to knock avatar off the highest grossing movie of all time.
From Aus to U.S you are in for a wild ride once opens..",positive
"I think some people are getting paid for these reviews. EG was such a letdown after the awesome Infinity War. I was ok with the demise of Stark as he was the one normal human. Captain America as an old man was bad. But by far, fat Thor was insulting to the fans. Movies, especially of this supposed caliber, are better off avoiding the lure of time travel to fix the situation. I would like for them to travel in time and do this movie properly.",positive
Utter garbage. The Russo brothers & Kevin Fiege are quite literally the worst thing to happen to cinema.,negative
In my opinion this is my second favorite movie in the MCU only outdone by Infinity War. The perfect end to one of the most ambitious stories ever constructed. kudos to marvel for this fantastic piece of art. Simply it's a love letter to the fans,positive
"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans & more star in this 2019 action sequel based on the Marvel Comics. In this final installment of ""The Avengers"" series, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Evans) and more try to give humanity a second chance after the unfortunate events of the last film, but must find the 6 infinity stones that are the key and face the evil, Thanos (Josh Brolin) again. My only gripe with this film is that it's too long, but other than that I thought it was good. The cast is great, Alan Silvestri's score is excellent as usual and there's neat effects. There's also humorous, emotional and action-packed moments.
I recommend this, especially if you're into comic books/superheroes.",positive
"It started back in 2008 with Ironman. And about 20 movies after that, phase 3 of the MCU ends with Endgame. And what an end it is! Goosebumps everytime I see the portals scene. Thank you!Haters take a chill-pill and try not to choke on it...",positive
"There were so many intriguing concepts that I picked up while watching this masterpiece. The Russo brothers and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely really outdid themselves with this adrenaline-rushed film.A couple things I must establish of course
The first thing would be Hulk's arc. Professor Hulk was a great idea, even though it was predicted long ago, we get as Banner says ""the best of both worlds"" and I understand people will and have already said or made complaints about how Hulk/banner didn't do much in the film, yet he was the one to wear the gauntlet, if anyone else put it on even for a second, they would've perished, whereas for Banner, it only damaged his arm.As for things that went into making this film, there is literally so much detail that went into producing this movie. Some examples being 'Harley' portrayed by Ty Simpkins from way back in 2013 during Ironman's final solo film debut, making an appearance during the funeral scene for simply showing his respects for a father figure like Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.). Every time travel scene as well was perfect and exactly the way it was back in The first avengers film, thor's sequel, etc. They managed to callback every actor that was in the original scenes.The story arcs:
Steve Rogers'(Chris Evans) arc was by far my favorite. ""God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war"" as quoted by Ultron(James Spader) in Avengers: Age of Ultron(2015). His reunion with Peggy(Hayley Atwell) in the end was so beautiful and long awaited, after all that Cap has done for his country and comrades, he really deserved something as simple as that dance with her as he promised at the end of ""The first Avenger""(2011) before he went into the ice. Cap wielding Mjolnir was my all time dream as many as other fans', you'd never think that Cap would actually wield Thor's mighty hammer but he DID and man did everyone in my theatre go crazy.And Thor being fat is the most understandable plot point that lots of people fail to understand or try to hate on. He lost countless loved ones, half of his people, and most of all screwed up by decapitating Thanos thinking that it'd fix something but it didn't, it was only a matter of time before he fell off the deep end and hit rock bottom after all that happened.Tony Stark's death was the most saddening thing in the film. Stark has always been getting negative feedback from everyone, saying things like he isn't hero, he's narcissistic, only fights for himself, or even as quoted by a naive Steve Rogers in the first Avengers film ""Not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay on a wire and the let the other guy crawl over you"". Or as an evil Wanda Maximoff(Elizabeth Olsen) forsaw in ""Age of Ultron"" where Stark was the only surviving Avenger and that he didn't do enough, yet he snapped his fingers to save trillions and was venerated as he deserved it.All of the fan service and call backs were perfect and I wouldn't say unnecessary or overdone. The scene in which all of the dusted and remaining heroes return, was THE biggest most immense scene in the history of cinema, I can happily tell my children in the future ""Yeah, the biggest event in Cinematic history, I was there and I witnessed something truly special that will never happen again."" The callback to ""The Winter Soldier""(2014) was perfect when Falcon quoted ""On your left"", *CHILLS* as the portal opened and the score began. Don't even get me started on the OST, Alan Silvestri was tasked with one of THE hardest jobs that factored into this film and he nailed it, he hammered that sh** hard. Not only did he construct the most epic soundtrack ever but he at the same time was able to invoke a sense of different types of pathos in multiple tracks. From hopeful, empowering, and epic in his song ""Portals"", to something that venerates Rdj's character like ""The Real Hero"". Or even something that admits a feel of tribute and legacy in ""Main on End"" during the end credits, in which there were 6 Original Avengers being honored amongst the fans, writers, everyone who was in support of this film. 6 signatures with the iconic original melody of the Avengers theme song rolling as we see Jeremy Renner's ""Hawkeye"", Scarlet Johansson's ""Black Widow"", Chris Hemsworth's ""Thor"", Mark Ruffalo's ""Hulk""/""Bruce Banner"", Chris Evans' ""Captain America"", & Robert Downey Jr's ""Ironman"".The intensity this film emits is truly satisfying and a film like this deserves even more credit and recognition. It's not some overhyped comicbook film that fails to please the fans, it is one of the most satisfying conclusive films to a 22-film saga, which has never been done.One flaw that I could not bare to ignore after watching a couple times was the final battle, the lead-up was perfect, the intensity was perfect, we get a perfect bone-chilling scene of all our heroes lined up to fight the biggest battle in film then they all run up and... its horrible. Its literally just the heroes running up and slaughtering a CGI army, there were no nail-biting climactic fights. And another thing is that we never see someone physically best thanos in a fight. One thing Infinity War did better than Endgame(And I hate to compare two films from the same saga and franchise) was the fight scene between Stark and Thanos on Titan, Thanos even had 4 stones and got wiped pretty good by the nanotech armor. If anything, they should have done a similar scene because the only instance in which we really see Thanos get bested was between him and Cap Marvel(briefly) and between him and Scarlett Witch as well. But it only lasted like 30 seconds. I wanted to see a rematch between him and banner or Stark, Thor, Cap, at least one of those four! Not a 10-15 second scene of Cap, thor, and Cap Marvel trying to hold him down until stark takes the stones out. Stark was nerfed as well as Thor. Captain Marvel was straight shoe-horned in as well, she only a got a few good licks in and that was it. Although that was just the climax, it could've been so much better, the wasted potential.",positive
"Once is not enough to watch this movie.
It blew me away.",positive
"This movie plays with your emotions if you have been keeping track with the MCU. If you haven't, don't watch this movie. This movie isn't for you. But if you have, this movie will blow your mind. It's epic, it's big and a feast to your eyes. It's not one of your typical comicbook movies. It has real stakes and the visuals are stunning. It has flaws of course, like some characters could've been handled better. But I think it's one of the best comicbook movies ever. The visuals, the storytelling, the stakes, the characters, it's just amazing.",positive
"What happened to the deep relatable character of Thanos?
Why is Thanos extremely overpowered now?
What happened to Thor one-shotting Thanos?
What the hell happened to Hulk?
Why didn't we get closure on the Bruce Banner - Black Widow story?
How could Captain America travel back in time without switching timelines?
What happened to the Avengers having to team up and defeat Thanos in an intelligent manner?All in all this movie provided quite some closure in a decently satisfactory manner. But it could have been so much better. The start of this movie contained too much silly humor in my opinion. Thor and Hulk have been turned into ridiculous comic relief characters. In the second half of the movie it got a little bit better.Thanos sucks. When he died at the beginning it was like he got replaced by a completely different character. All of his character development in Infinity War was gone and he was turned into a mindless brute that felt like a side-villain to me. Also, why could Thor defeat him easily in Infinity War when he had all of the Infinity Stones but didn't stand a chance now? Ok, maybe it's because he got out of shape. Then why couldn't Captain Marvel defeat him? Wasn't she supposed to be even more powerful than Thor?To me it seemed like they threw all of Thors character development out of the window. Throughout Ragnarok and Infinity War he became super powerful and got to the top of his game and changed into a true king. I was hoping to see him unleash that insane power in Endgame. Instead, he changed into a total fool.The end battle is cool. It was nice to see all the characters uniting in one last battle. Captain America wielding Mjolnir is awesome. Apart from those things, it was pretty mindnumbing. Even the end battle in the cartoon tv-series was better. There everybody had to come together and use their unique strengths to defeat Thanos one stone at a time. In Avengers 1, Age of Ultron and Civil War the Avengers were a mess that was falling apart. I was hoping to see them unite harmoniously as a team once and for all in this movie. That didn't happen.Tony Stark and Captain America got closure in a reasonably satisfactory manner. I always imagined Captain America going back to his own time to live out his life. Sadly this is followed by a huge plothole. Tony Stark is arguably the protagonist of the MCU and his ending was beautiful. Using the infinity stones was his destiny.",positive
"This movie is not just a superhero Marvel movie, it's far beyond. It's a 3 hour ride, a roller coaster, during this time you won't be able to get bored even for a second, but you will be glued to the screen a bit scared to lose any word said or fraction of scene. I can say for sure that this it the most amazing, fun, creative and beautiful production ever made in cinema, yes, so much so. The script, acting, twists, action, drama number of movie-stars and actors etc are so good and coordinating so well, that even I who saw any good movie ever made was surprised. It's such a beautiful movie, with a deep dive into the soles of the main characters, and there is a build up for that part from the moment the movie begins, it's not the typical Marvel movie you have seen before, it's much more about friendship, love, family and other human values that matters in life more then anything, that matters, and that gives the Avengers their real power, superheros are actually more human then humans, they have their powers but it's the values that bring them together and make them the best they can be. Will take years to any movie to be made to be as good or more, the last one I recall is The Dark Night, then Infinity War, and now it's this one that creates a new benchmark in this genre, and in cinema in general. This movies ties-up all the prior Marvel movies into one grand ending. Satisfaction guaranteed 10/10.",positive
Was it good? Of course it was.... Was it the best one in the series? Not even close... I was so excited for this movie and I left disappointed.,positive
"First 2 hours of nothing with stupid humor just to make some children laugh and then while getting closer to the final battle... Still the same one liners to make us laugh... I won't even mention the storyline and it's plot holes... Everything in this movie is wrong...

It's a disgrace and great disrespect to all our favorite heroes who are portrayed as a parody of themselves (Thor and Hulk especially)...
This film is clearly not made for marvel fans.. Such a shame... Because for me last year's AVENGERS film was simply the best superhero movie of all time...
The Endgame unfortunately was just a family comedy... 😠",negative

"This film takes story action and amazing charters and puts it in to a grate 3 hours. But people complain about the film not having an end credits but if you listen you can hear a sound , it's iron man making his armour in the cave and that is the best end credits sense for me. People also complain about Hulk but he had a big role and my production is that he won't cope with black widows death and this will lead to wwHulk which is were he loses control and try's to destroy everyone. These little details and deaths will lead to better films and that's just one of the many reasons to why this film is a 10.",positive

"I don't know if we ever could of imagined the state of Marvel comic-book movies 11 years after the first MCU film in 2008, to review this film as a movie a one of film, I don't think that would do it justice because as a single stand alone film (even though its a sequel) would not do it the proper justice , however this is the only way I know how to break down a film. I will judge the MCU as a whole in another review. If I was to sum this movie up as brief as possible its, Avengers end game is the fan service movie you didn't know you wanted, with a story and battles thrown in there to pad the run time.
Where the movie succeeds is in its grandeur and its design, it is extremely large scale, sometimes to its own detriment ( I looking at you final battle sequence ) but nevertheless you can feel the immensity of this epic, I will be breaking it down into several parts, Story, Cinematography, Actors/Actress , Characters, Motivations, Soundtrack, Pacing, Design, Re-watch ability & HeartStory
when you have a story that expands over 20 plus movies to culminate into one it is a hard task, but this movie does succeed in the story it has clear goals, which they seem to accomplish, sometimes without any resistance what so ever, the scene where Tony stark, just happens to make time travel possible after stating it could never be done, was a little jarring & every obstacle that they did eventually encounter was immediately remedied, antmans a baby then turn the power off , couldn't get the correct stone, just go back again, there seemed to be obstacles placed in there way in order for the heroes to just step over them, rather then a climb or hurdle, personally I feel it would have been better to have as many if they were not as significant, the part I loved was in the first act where we see a 5 year jump and the world is still in mourning over the vanishing of half the population, the arc in which Hawk eye is introduced again was a satisfying one, the lead up to the inevitable gathering of all the heroes from earth and beyond was something expected in the final act but was done in a way that would even simmer the harshest of critics, the killing of Thanos in the first 10 minutes was a pleasant surprise, but without a clear antagonist until about 1 hour and 45 minute mark, the story progression took a back seat for character development, Storyline Score 7.5/10Cinematography
Thankfully unlike a lot of the other MCU this film sense of Enormity was done quite well with the cinematography, while the standardised shot, reverse shots were very predominant, there are a few glorious moments, mainly involving the quantum realm & the final battle sequence, the colour scenes and lighting are an improvement on Infinity war up until the final battle, but the cold colour pallet sets the mood for a very different MCU film in the beginning , Cinematography Score 6/10Actors/Actress
To me this is where the movie shines its brightest as there is a range we see from many actors, the desperation in the beginning on Chris Hemsworth's face & the slight lip quiver and slightly tearing eyes of Scar-Jo allowed us to see this is a passionate cast we are dealing with, the subtleties of almost every actor in this film reflect the minor changes they have from shot to shot, with a show don't tell style which is refreshing for the MCU. Stand-outs are RDJ, Chris Evens & Scarlet Johansen
Actor/actress score 8.5/10Characters
Every character in this film felt like they had a role to play, and there wasn't too much cross over between them, rocket raccoon was the snippy one, ant-man was the comic relief however Thor was a problem to say the least, the running gag of him being a fat hair drunk was played up way to much and in almost every scene he was in we are constantly reminded that he is drunk and fat and hairy, he was the anti Thor to every other Thor portrayals & it wasn't because of what he went through it was because of how he was written. The characters develop properly in this and while there isn't many major arcs in the film involving characters the one of Tony stark from, being afraid to do anything because of the fear of losing his daughter or his daughter losing him transcending into the hero that defeated Thanos and died in the process, was not only touching but poetic, the sounds of sobbing where heard in the theatres and it was a (forgive the pun) stark reminder of what the characters mean to people here in the real world. Character score 7/10Motivations
Every movie has the characters that motivations make no sense - this film is no different , however as of writing this, I cannot find a world breaking character motivation that took me away from the film, they all had goals and did what they needed to do to achieve those goals. With one of the exception, when evil nebula comes back from the past, everyone seems to forget about her while sorting out the infinity stones, which felt like a plot device to allow her to bring Thanos to the future.
Motivations 9/10Soundtrack
The best part of the score was the nostalgic soundtracks when different characters were introduced and combined with the current score, the music in this film is generic and nothing to write home to, there is a distinct lack of strong motivating soundtrack to pump you up nor one to bring you down when needed, for me this was one of the most disjointing parts of the film .Soundtrack score 3/10Pacing
The film has a pacing issue, go figure a 3 hour movie with a pacing issue, there are scenes and segments where it is clear, this section is for laughing, this section is for going wow, this is the sad section and felt extremely stretched, the first 1 hour and a half was the hardest part to get through pacing wise, when we are so used to a full film being over by this stage, I feel there is many parts of this film that could be cut out to make it more streamline without compromising the final product.
The final act approx 1 hour 10 minutes of the film goes extremely fast while the first 2 acts seem to almost double in length when watching it. Pacing score 5/10Design
There is not much to say about the design of the world they create, everything is as it should be, the time machine looked great and believable, Thanos ships & warriors, every planet (most of which we have seen before) were done almost flawlessly - the only concern I had was the look of Thanos when moved and fought, seemed extremely ridged and choppy, not sure if that is to do with where I watched it on, but it was jarring. Design score 8.5 out of 10Re-watch ability
This is where this part of the review gets tricky, there are parts that are extremely fun and enjoyable to watch over and over again, give me the first 15 minutes and the last hour, but to go through the choppy paced part of the film when you already know what is happening, is a task, a movie like this which has many ups and downs within it, its a journey and one I will not be partaking a 3rd time any time soon. It does take a lot out of you physically and emotionally & reliving those emotional moments tends to make them less of an impact & with those moment this films climax would not stand up. Re-watch ability score 6/10Heart
This movie does have heart, it is the one key factor that I find in more of the grittier comicbook film I tend to enjoy more, there is a joyfulness that is thrown in there in times of stress , undercutting the tension of the film, this is what I call marvel-ing for everything serious you have you must immediately undercut it with something else, normally this is one of my biggest pet peeves about marvel films as of late but for what ever within the confines of this film I felt them more necessary then ever, the characters interaction with each other and the care you can see is not just an act make this movie much more than I expected. Heart score 9/10
Adding the totals I give the film a review of 70.5% Making it the 5th highest aggregate score
That being Said, I did thoroughly enjoy the film and do recommend it.",positive
"Wow...now that's how you wrap up a long running series! I did actually enjoy Infinity War a tiny bit more just because it was generally more of a nonstop ride and had a slightly more coherent narrative as it built up to its cliffhanger ending, whereas this was kind of all over the place, but in a good way! Infinity War, or part one as it really was because these two movies go together so amazingly well, was better in terms of action and was more conventionally 'fun', but this is definitely a deeper and more emotionally and thematically rich movie and it certainly made an impact on me, by the end I sure felt I'd been through the cinematic wringer! At the beginning I was quite taken back by how they unceremoniously lop off a very weakened Thanos' head and the screen abruptly cut to five years later. The movie slows itself way down and spends a hefty amount of time setting up how broken the characters are as it languishes in the faded world that the dreaded snap left behind, and I won't lie that part of it did begin to drag for me, but it was still a much needed slow start, because it serves the purpose of just carrying on where things last left off and making you feel for the scattered heroes more as they gradually mobilise and begin to formulate a very tenacious plan of action to set things right, and when the lost heroes do return from oblivion near the end it felt very earned. It was so brilliant how the quantum realm time hopping Infinity Stone hunt doubled as a way of tying up some very longstanding plot threads and character arcs. I think what they did with Captain America was beautiful, with him doing something for himself for once instead of the greater good and having the happy ending he deserved in the time where he truly belonged. Cap always seemed a bit like a man out of time and it was touching to see him get to go home at last... I also liked the scene where the comically chunky, but no less heroic where it counted Thor got to share a few words with his mother, I thought her death in Dark World was sad and I'm pretty sure I'm one of the few out there who actually thought that particular movie was pretty good! The best reunion though for me would have to be when Tony Stark finally shared a scene with his estranged and late father, albeit a much younger version of him, and although he might not have known who Tony really was, they had such an easy chemistry together that you did believe them as father and son and that moment did offer a little closure for Tony as a character, and I loved that scene. Robert Downey gave it his all and while seeing his character die was really sad he did sacrifice himself to save the whole world and maybe even the universe, there's surely no grander a way to go out than that! His character was certainly the most iconic Avenger and probably a main factor of what got this franchise off the ground and turned it into what it became in the first place, so it was only right that the final defeat of Thanos should have belonged to him. They saved the really huge fantastical fight sequence till last, but man did they make up for it, such an incredible battle, good god was I in awe!!! The stakes were effectively higher because after seeing that his grand plan for the galaxy didn't really change anything for the better as well as his own death, Thanos had a far worse plan in store once he had his hands on the stones and was more malevolent and determined than ever before to destroy the Avengers, so it did kind of make sense how he was harder to defeat in armed combat with a giant sword against all three of the main Avengers champions than he was when armed with the gauntlet! The big, purple and bald tyrant just would not go down and there were numerous awesome moments to take in, among the best being Scarlet Witch's reckoning where she breaks his blade in two with her powers and almost tears him limb from limb until he cheats and orders an aerial bombardment in order to get away, and I loved when he took out that overpowered wench Captain Marvel with one Power Stone-powered punch, because she was just as tacked-on and off-putting as she was in her stupid lame movie! I also liked the clever role-reversal in the subplot with the reformed Nebula convincing the younger Gamora to turn to the side of good like she once had done with her, but unfortunately being unable to reach her more fanatical former self... So this was terrific, I'm so glad that I was able to get onboard with these movies that involved and expanded upon each other and slowly build up to this incredible closing chapter, I don't speak for everyone of course, and I'll happily check out whatever's next for the mcu, but as far as this movie goes, the whole endeavour feels like it's run its course now, and I doubt very much that they'll ever be able to equal it, much less top it. Infinity War and Endgame were the big one, and I loved them, wonderful conclusion, what a blast, what a Marvel! X",positive

"Just try to imagine someone who didn't watch the 22 previous Avengers movies, watching this movie.It's just totally incomprehensible.And even for someone (like me) who watched the previous movies, how can I remember all the details after 11 years ?Too many characters and too much talkings, this movie is BORING ! A pile of private jokes doesn't make a good movie.I give 3 stars for the last 20 minutes. Just for the SFX, but I don't understand who fighting who and why.",negative
A fun ride! End game is full of spectacular performances and action. The film has plenty of surprises so stay away from spoilers before seeing it.,positive
"Tony stark has meant a lot for me ever since I was 8. Iron man 1 has been out for 3 years now so i was kinda late to the party. But after watching iron man 1, I quickly watched every other MCU movie. At the time I never knew this was a cinematic universe, so when the avengers came out I was ecstatic. Tony stark, over the last 11 years has felt like a father figure, my dad is very supportive and loving but Tony was as much a father figure to me, as he was to Peter, and to millions of others. So when he dies, I felt it like my father dying. And it was a mixture of sadness and anger, rethinking the look on my face through the entire runtime of Iron Man 1. And how scared I was when he almost died in the first avengers, and when he gets stabbed in infinity war. And when he fights with his best friend. This movie, makes me wonder what direction they possible could go, now that Tony and Cap are gone. But the movies send off for both these characters has to be one of the saddest things I've ever seen or witnessed, not only on screen but in real life. You may think that's ridiculous but these characters mean so much to me. I almost cried when Cap says ""I had a date"" in the first captain America film. So when Tony is finally able to reconcile with his father, and Cap gets his dance with Peggy, my heart is shattered, and I can't tell if it's a good thing, or a devastating one. But even the rest of the film is great and I highly recommend.",positive
Stop reading the reviews & go watch it in theaters..... Its worth it,positive
"This was one of the best Marvel films ever, it was a great watch, and as someone who has complete invested into the MCU, I can say that this was a greta finish to a great film series.",positive
Before this my all time favourite movie was Gladiator. But this one topped that . I have seen all Marvel movies more than one time. And the conclusion to all those movies is perfect. Ppl who don't like the story or the pace of the movie do not get what they tried to achieve over 22 movies. I can't see anything wrong with the movie. Things that bothered some ppl didn't bother me at all. This was the end of an era do ppl rlly want that fitted in a 2 hour movie NOoooo! Dont be a baby over the 3 hour sit. It is so worth it! If u can't see that than don't bother writing a review. I can accept bad reviews if they are thought trough. Everybody has their own taste but don't hate just to hate. I wrote this cause ppl that like movies don't leave reviews as often as ppl who don't like it. So go watch this movie and enjoy every second of it ;-),positive
The epic final battle brings a smile to my face every time.,positive
"I admit I had fairly high expectations for this movie, but in this instance I find it justified given the buildup to this particular movie.To put it shortly, it is inferior to Infinity War in every way. I've seen infinity war probably 8 times now and Endgame makes me appreciate it even more. The pacing and execution of Infinity War is incredible in comparison. Infinity war felt like a much more mature movie in that there are moments that still make me feel sadness for the characters and the pacing of the movie was far better. Endgame felt all over the place. There were moments I wanted to tear up but the scenes didn't feel adequate to really draw a reaction. They moved on far too quickly and the movie itself was choppy. It was hard to really relate to the characters. When I first saw Infinity War I wondered how they would handle so many characters in one film and be able to still have the audience empathize with them, but any doubts were laid to rest. This movie is pretty much the worst case scenario for how to handle many characters.Don't get me wrong, there were parts that were quite satisfying, which is hard to go into further detail about without divulging too much information.All in all this movie was saved by particular scenes and those few moments of feeling resolution. It felt more childish in execution and appeal and Infinity War felt more mature than the typical Marvel movie. When I saw Captain Marvel I really disliked it, but I thought it was a one off and they would be redeemed with Endgame. This was not the case.Definitely see it, and see it in theatres if you can, just don't go in with the highest of expectations.",positive
This movie was incredible I did like avengers infinity I thought no over marvel film would top it but some how avengers end game has beat marvel movie ever and one of the best of all time.,positive
"Let me preface this by saying that I definitely belong in the ""casual Marvel fan"" category; so feel free to take this with a grain of salt.I liked watching ""Endgame"". It was clearly the more emotional of the Infinity saga, the villain was better handled, and there were times when I was firmly butt-in-seat for whatever came next. Did it need to crash the 3-minute threshold? Good lord, no! I never glanced at my watch (which I guess says something) but it's not without its draggy segments. And as much as I wanted the team to get back at the bad guy and make things right, I was more interested in the time-travel, fan service and movie-hopping than I was in the big battle scene.Don't get me wrong; I know this is a milestone. Ten years' worth of franchise-building capped in one movie; filling the imposing shoes of vanquishing Thanos; raking in a billion dollars. It was less escapism for me than it was witnessing history in the making. That much was palpable. And this a good movie, but it's hard to say if it lives up the unbelievable hype.For me, it's questionable.",positive
"Where can I even start with this thing? Why do people act like it's one of the greatest, most visionary works in years? It took me three days to get through the whole slog and the more I thought about it afterwards, the worse it got. If it didn't become the highest grossing movie ever I probably wouldn't have bothered finishing it. The fact that it got that much money is truly head-scratching; it was even bad by normal Marvel standards, let alone Scorsese ones. (Infinity War was at least more entertaining.)To all the people calling this a great culmination to so many movies: How could you treat this like any kind of ending? We all know that Disney's going to churn out as many more of these movies as they can, and probably drag RDJ back into it once people finally get sick of them. I've already heard people are clamoring for 'the next Endgame', which shows how much staying power this one has. It'll probably go the same way as Martin and Lewis movies: an extremely popular fad that will eventually become an embarrassment; a punchline.To all the people saying 'something like this has never been done in cinema before': Not exactly. Have you seen Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein? You get a crossover between Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolf Man, the Invisible Man, plus Abbot and Costello. Yes, it's not on the same level as Endgame, but it is still something *like* it. To say nothing of the first Avengers movie which was still better than this.And by the way, Martin Scorsese was right. This movie-and all other M 'C' U films made in the past 5-10 years-are not cinema because they have become an extended TV show. This doesn't play at all like a cinematic climax at all, it plays like the last episode of a TV series: a mediocre creation spending an inordinate amount of time referencing the previous episodes. So Avengers Endgame is not cinema the same way the Seinfeld finale is not considered cinema.The visuals: -1 star. They are the usual murky CGI and greenscreens, nothing special at all. They thought they could get an Oscar for this? The final battle is an ugly CGI mess that makes the Ready Player One final battle look like a masterclass. There's no beauty or scale or anything in the battle to visually show that this is supposed to be an epic final struggle; instead it plays out like any other Marvel action scene just with tons more characters thrown in, puking worthless energy beams and buzzing around like flies on a corpse.The soundtrack: +0 stars. It's competent, but quite bland and forgettable. Let's just say that no one will be rushing in line to buy the soundtrack.The plot: -4 stars. Tons of McGuffins, and they must all be collected with time travel. The time travel storyline caused innumerable inconsistencies. Try as the Endgame fans might, there is no way to make sense of this garble. Go back in time to get more Pym particles? Go back in time and kill Thanos in the Infinity War final battle? No, they have to do it *exactly* this way. I seem to remember they refused to save Black Widow after she died because 'the guy said she was dead for sure'. Then Gamora came back even though she died the same way in the previous movie. I don't really have a problem with plot holes generally, but the script just kept calling attention to them in a meta, snarky way. Meanwhile, the entire 'snap' resolve was cheap and lazy; exactly what I expected would happen after finishing Infinity War. So, after 4 years suddenly as all these long dead people just *return*. There is NO way you can explain this in a way to make it sound sane. Meanwhile, Tony Stark's sacrifice scene is rotten. Basically what happens is he grabs all of Thanos' power stones and uses them to do the same thing to Thanos that Thanos was trying to do to them: turn him into dust. So, this Machiavellian mess is the culminating message of the 20-something movie series? The guy with the most power wins using whatever means are available? That's literally everything; it's the only message. The reason the Lord of the Rings had such a great story was that the characters had a massive power, but couldn't use it, and that caused a deep psychological tension. Here there's nothing; just grab the most powerful stuff there is and use it to kill your opponents and 'win'. It sucked. The most real kind of courage is when people know they're going to lose and keep fighting anyway. It would have been nice to have that here instead.The script: -3 stars. We don't expect great scripts from these movies, but at least they're usually funny. This is probably the least funny Marvel movie ever, with barely a single joke landing. (Fat Thor could have been funny but they sucked the humor out of him by having him sulk almost all the time). All of War Machine's 'funny' lines are truly cringey, as are the couple of belated, out of place jokes from the many actors who cameo at the end. So, it isn't funny. The screenplay then drains the rest of its energy trying to cover up plot holes it knows the audience will anticipate, but doesn't even succeed and all that dialogue just highlights the inconsistencies. Case in point: the infamous 'baby Thanos' dialogue. Case in point: the entire stupid 'time travel doesn't work that way' saga. Calling other time travel movies garbage is not a way to give your one a free pass. If they would have just owned up to the plot holes instead of attempting to explain them away with meta, lazy dialogue, it would have been more bearable. And don't even get started on the emotional dialogue, but at least they tried to be somewhat serious for once.The acting: -1 star. I never realized how bad an actor Chris Evans was until he tried to be emotional in this movie. RDJ, once so charismatic and funny, is reduced to the stale shtick of pop-culture references and product placement. Lots of the others looked bored as they spent a huge majority of the movie sulking, moping, getting drunk, having therapy, whining, killing for spite, etc. And then all they can obsess about is reversing their loss so they win; it's even worse than the Democrats after the 2016 election. Are they really that sore of losers? It's been FIVE freaking years! Get over it. It's surprising they didn't just kill themselves in their mire of self-pity.The positive: Well, I can't find any. This is the first one star review I've given on this site.",negative

"How are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in ""Infinity War"" weren't just a dream): magic or time travel. All I'll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of ""Back to the Future II"" (1989).""Endgame"" (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.Everything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff's edge, and much more.Unfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can't concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie's overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute.GRADE: B-",positive

"Wow! I mean just wow! Coming out of the cinema with joy and memories is why I rated this 10 stars. This film is how you bring together characters across a universe in the most perfect way possible. It is really a masterpiece especially if you have grown up with the MCU.Onto the film itself, from the start, I was hooked in. The film develops from a slow but sweet introduction and the pace increases superbly until the final battle. The cinematography, CGI, acting and dialogue fit the movie well and the story was exciting. I loved the references to past MCU movies and seeing older characters shown on screen again. Alan Silvestri amazes us with the music up until the credits (the credits were so amazing)All cast members were brilliant. It is evident they loved the filming process and had chemistry between them. Anthony and Joe Russo were definitely the perfect people to lead the movie. Hats off to the entire staff behind this cinematic masterpiece!",positive

"Being the final chapter of Avenger series expectation was very high. Especially because of the superb success of the earlier chapter, ""The Infinity War"" which was undoubtedly a joy to watch. Since the bar was set so high it was not that easy for the movie makers to surpass the hype. Thus in the final chapter makers lack the finesse . There are flaws as the movie was very slow in some parts and it was very lengthy too. Moreover, though it's all fictitious but still the ""Time Machine"" concept looked pretty ordinary. The Iron-Man tragedy was also pretty dramatic and illogical. Otherwise the movie does well. So overall.......... not upto the mark. Expected a lot!!!",positive

"I'm not going to bother watching any more of these Marvel movies. Each one seems worse than the last, and there's way too much CGI. It's not like most of them are more than a 5/10 anyway, and that's being generous. I can't wait until one of them bombs at the box office, so that we can stop getting constant special effects demo tapes and watch some real movies. Death to cgi!",negative
"While I am sad to see the Avengers saga end, Endgame was a great way to have it go out with a BANG! From beginning to end it was an amazing movie that you could even tell it was 3hrs long because it was fast paced! It was sad but hilarious in parts! Too bad it has to end but like I said what a way to end it all! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!",positive
". . . (that is, CNN and MSNBC) have labeled our current threat to Life the USA as we've known it as Washington: Endgame, in apparent homage to AVENGERS: ENDGAME. Where these courageous news outlets may differ amongst themselves is in regard to which facets of the Armageddon-like Final Battle of the movie represent who, among the Axis of Evil's Real Life gathering of Satanic Forces. While ""R. Maddow"" on MSNBC has not been shy about pointing out that the cinema Bad Guy's Giant Flying Slug is a dead ringer for POTUS #45, CNN's ""A. Cooper"" seems equally convinced that this flick's ""Thanos"" is met to represent ""The Teflon Don."" Today, in THIS Reality, as ""Little Rocket Man"" is initiating the World's Nuclear Meltdown, as Iran verges on erasing Israel, as the USA's cold Trade War with Red Commie China is a nuclear football away from turning Red Hot, and as ""Mad Vlad"" Putin's henchman (aka, the White House Pawn, aka the KGB Puppet) declares himself ""President for Life,"" does it really matter whether Rachel or Anderson is the most correct?",positive
"The best Marvel movie so far!
Perfection at its best!",positive
How do you sum up the culmination of ten years of cinematic brilliance in two sentences? By simply saying it is pretty damn good.,positive
"Yep it's long, but it's packed from start to end. It didn't feel like three hours. There aren't any 'slow' parts, even the non-action bits are full of story so make sure to go to the bathroom before it starts.Some story lines are wrapped up, others are left open for the future. It doesn't feel like 'the end' at all.There's really a lot of story, so much so that we are going to have to head back to the theater and see it again. And it will still be worth every penny spent.One star is knocked off for a bit of universe continuity weirdness that will be evident when you watch it.",positive
"It has been eleven years and 21 films until this point and whether or not you have been a fan of each and every film or not, it's undeniable that what producer Kevin Feige has been spearheading all these years is unprecedented and will probably be at least another decade until something like this is even attempted again. Even though Avengers: Infinity War felt like every storyline was colliding last year, Avengers: Endgame is the true finale of what they are now calling the Infinity Saga. Beginning with Iron Man in 2008 and finishing with Avengers: Endgame in 2019, this is a franchise that was made for fans of this newfound genre in superhero filmmaking and Avengers: Endgame is a near-perfect conclusion in every way.Picking up shortly after the events of Avengers: Infinity War (and don't worry, I won't be spoiling anything from this movie), we meet the team at their lowest point in the entire franchise. The first act of this film is really just about them coping, but shimmers of hope begin to arise, giving them ideas and possibilities for a new future going forward. The journey this film takes you on is absolutely astounding and there are some moments that will have you thinking the franchise has officially peaked, but I feel that fans have earned those moments for being invested through thing many films. There's honestly only so much to say without ruining the experience, so I'll move on to some specifics here.Robert Downey Jr. has always been great as Tony Stark, but due to the circumstances left by the previous film, I truly don't think he's ever been as good on-screen as he is in this film. He carries the emotional weight of the film on his shoulders and I just wanted to applaud every second he was on camera. On top of that, everyone from Karen Gillan (Nebula) getting more Tod do than she has ever done, to Chris Evans truly earning back his character's name, to even Jeremy Renner, who hasn't exactly had many standout moments until now, every cast member brings their all here and I could go on for days about how Avengers: Endgame features the most devoted cast any of these films have seen. I would also like to commend Scarlett Johansson, as it has been years since I've seen her this committed to a character.Audiences will flock to this movie hoping for a lot of big-budget spectacle, and although there are some of the craziest sequences in the franchise thus far, I have to admit that fans of drama will also probably appreciate this movie more than most of the films in the franchise. The impact the previous film has on this movie is severe and it really shows throughout the first two acts. From some great cinematography and new visuals we've yet to see until now, this is the definition of a film that has it all.There's so much I would like to dive into here, but I'll just say this is the definition of a movie that people dream up when watching a franchise. Story threads are tied up nicely, the spectacle is dialled up to a million, the performances are probably the best that this franchise has ever seen, and the humour is absolutely still present and well-balanced with the drama in a way that feels needed for this heavy movie. Overall, Avengers: Endgame isn't a perfect movie, because really, no film of this size can truly be perfect, but this was one of the best theatre-going experiences I've had in years. This is a true finale that earns every second of it's three hour run time. Here's to a bright future for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",positive
"Underwhelming. They managed to tie it all off and put a nice bow on top and for me it sits as an above average action finale but only as a series ender. If it was a stand alone movie it would be a drag. It's a movie that would be hard to sit through again. It leaves me thinking they could have done better but also could have done a lot worse. The plot is adequate but not inspired, a ""time travel"" flake out which anyone could have predicted. Go back in time, fix everything, and they do; Ant man sucked and Hawkeye is not my favorite so his screen time was dull. Bree Larson getting knocked out was alright but that scenario felt like a re-write. Talking Hulk sucked. Thors new character style sucked. A lot of things sucked but overall it's still above average genre entertainment and core fans will definitely find a lot to enjoy.",positive
"This was the best adieu to last 11 years of marvel. It was emotional, i can still feel the gossebumps. It had its own flaws and I didn't get 1 or 2 answers i was looking in this movie but in the end I was satisfied, the second half went on another level and some set pieces will be remembered for years to come.
Once in a decade a movie in this genre comes who defines the genre, the previous 10 years was The Dark Knight from this year onwards it would be Endgame.",positive
"Firstly let's address the Hulk.. they still undelivered on this character, it still remained a let down. I, aswell as most, wanted a thanos and Hulk rematch that didn't happen.Most of the movie is slow paced and the Thor character direction was absolutely strange. Iron man and cap carry the movie.I am somewhat satisfied but overall a bit disappointed but that could because Infinity war was going to be a hard act to follow as it is a brilliant action film.There is still to much political agenda through out the story that will probably leave me with this being my last marvel movie.That being said, avengers assemble and infinity war still remain as the best marvel movies with end game being third.It's a great movie but I think most true fans will remain slightly underwhelmed in alot of areas, mostly Hulk. What a shame.",positive
"I seriously don't get all the high ratings on this film!! The first hour was a total boring snooze fest (it was like being at a wake). Then there are the logic problems in the movie:
1) Time travel- the movie tells us that they can't go back in time and kill Thanos because that would 'violate the time laws' okay but they can go back and steel the stones, fight with their past selves, and interact with their dead parents???
2) the society can build a well manicured monument complete with granite engraved names of the missing but CAN'T pick up the garbage all over the streets???
3) Okay half the people are gone but why are the scenes full of EMPTY streets?? You'll still have people in the cites just half as many. So NYC would go from 1 million plus to 500,000 plus. ect.Anyways for me it was not well written, the acting was flat, and the action was missing. I think Infinity War was 10x better.",negative
"People in the cinema were shouting and crying for joy when the Avengers who died came back to fight with Thanos. It was the best audience reaction I've ever seen! Was wondering though how Captain Marvel was able to control the Mjolnir. Unexpected deaths, two among the Avengers, and unexpected ending with regard to Steve Rogers and Hawkeye. Was expecting that Capt. Marvel would be the one to defeat Thanos, but it wasn't the case. Overall, the movie was enjoyable.",positive

"It has been, a little under eleven years since I saw the first iron man movie with my dad in the movie theater, at the time none of us really could imagine what was in store for us. the infinity saga is one of the most complex stories I have ever seen strung together within the cinematic universe. Endgame has everything I could have asked for, humor, plot twists, world-class acting, life lessons, heartbreak, and most importantly closure, and although not all of them are great, I am certain that I one day will make my kids watch the entire saga in the hopes that they will find them as special as we did.To The Russo brothers, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee, and all the other geniuses behind this amazing adventure, Thank you for telling us your story.",positive

"The better the ratings on a sci-fi movie the worse the science, but who cares if we're being fed thus absorb ""fake"" information. More combustion powered & structurally dumb space vehicles making sounds in the vacuum of space & swooshing sounds in air. Well, looks cool as do all the super powers that seem to get crazier w/each new series release. Why are little things like glassy rocks so empowered in sci-fi/fantasy movies? Usual dumbed down dialogue except the three worded line by one famous (and the movie is loaded w/famous) actor (bet you can't guess who).
Started slow, but got hot 'n' heavy towards the end.",positive
"First two hours were a very, very slow build. I know a great ending needs a compelling build but this was too much and too boring. Last hour was fun, but too Disney, and not enough time for us to enjoy the characters that have been so carefully crafted for us over the years.""Endgame"" was a not-entirely-successful attempt to leverage the same emotion and desperation of ""Days of Future Past."" Think about how you felt for the few mutants left in the world staving off the relentless onslaught of Sentinels in DOFP and compare that to the saccharinely-sweet Disney approach to ""Endgame"". ""Hey, lets try time travel?!""In the last hour think about how each star in the end of ""Endgame"" predictably got their little slots to say or do something.That's Disney.In contrast, the opening battle with Thanos in ""Endgame"" was emotional and severe. Captain Marvel puts Thanos in a headlock. Thor chops his hand off. Awesome! The scene was perfectly crafted. Super quick. The whole movie couldn't be a fight scene but ""Endgame"" lost the classic Marvel flair RIGHT after Thor ended Thanos.Great cameo by Jim Starlin - creator of Thanos - as the group therapy leader (I think that was him.) Nice touch in the mighty Marvel mannerToo much screen time for the uber-uninteresting Nebula (who I do not remember from the comics.) More time for her than favs Black Panther, Dr. Strange, Drax, Spidey... Drax was CREATED to kill Thanos. ""Drax the Destroyer."" I digress.As usual Robert Downey Junior was fun to listen to and the ""glue"" IMO for the movie (not Chris Evans)Thor's ""thoughtlessly funny"" jabs at others (Rocket Raccoon as a rabbit, etc) have been funny throughout the series but he was not a Thunder God in ""Endgame"" and his humor in particular - both as the quitter and as reinvigorated Avenger - took away from the story. Complete momentum killers.Too many contrived Disney moments like the unlikely female Avengers team up in the middle of a planetary war; jokes and yucks in the middle of said war, and Pepper, inexplicably, in a metal suit.Hulk doesn't fight (at all) in this movie and therefore doesn't get Thanos back for the beating he took in the beginning of ""Infinity Wars."" That. Was. A. Complete. Opportunity. Missed. Someone overthought something in the brainstorming sessionCap lifting the hammer. I know it's a nod to Cap being ""the first Avenger"" but the hammer is supposed to be sacred. In contrast, Vision's hammer moment in ""Age of Ultron"" was clever and classic.Speaking of Vision, it sucks that we never really got to see him ""show his stuff,"" like earth-pressing maximum weight + density and Wonder-Man-level super strengthI'm an old school Marvel fan. I enjoy every movie (even the awful FF and X-Men failures) because as a kid I always wondered what it would be like to see these amazing characters and stories on the big screen. After the buildup arranged by so many Marvel movies I was psyched for ""Endgame."" I expected more. I wanted to love it. I liked it.(""Spider Man Homecoming"" remains my fav Marvel movie)",positive

"I haven't nt seen all the Marvel movies, but I've seen some - the Iron mans, the Ant mans, Cpt Marvel. I enjoyed them. I thought I'd go and see what the fuss was about. However this, is so formulaic, ridicilous and boring I couldn't take it for the whole film. I walked out after 2 hours, and it felt every bit as long as that. If you're not a huge Marvel fan already, you may well not like this film, because I feel it's somewhat self-indulgent. It's like an effort to squeeze a bit more money out of fans.",negative
"Some thoughts I had whole watching this:1. Given the importance of their mission, and considering they only had one shot to get it right, wouldn't it have been better to wait a bit for Thor to get back in shape after 5 years of total inactivity? You know, just on the off chance would need the God of Thunder in all his glory?
(Speaking of, I find it interesting that they didn't include Fat Thor on the poster)2. Wouldn't it have been smarter to tell Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel about their plan to go back in time, and then wait for her to maybe tag along too? Just in case her help would prove valuable in defeating Thanos?3. Tony being such a genius and all, who pretty much solved the time travel equation in one night, couldn't he have made some more Pym Particles so they'd have more than one chance to make the future right again?4. Am I the only one who thought that Tony's sacrifice, while heroic and noble, was also somewhat preventable? He had the gauntlet with the stones, why didn't he just fly away with and let someone else snap their fingers, someone who was not just a regular human with no superpowers? Like Hulk, who had done it once already. Or Thor, who absorbed the energy of a star in the previous Avengers movie and lived to tell the tale. Or Captain Marvel, who also absorbed copious amounts of alien energy and was pretty fine afterwards. He had the stones and he could make his suit fly, what would Thanos have done, who was now probably afraid of him because of the potential power afforded him by the infinity stones?5. Speaking of sacrifices, Natasha's was foreseeable from the moment it was decided she and Clint/Hawkeye would go after the Soul Stone. They all knew, or should have known from Nebula at the very least, that the Soul Stone requires a sacrifice, so shouldn't they have discussed it before? The way she and Clint fought over who gets to sacrifice themselves, they risked both of them dying and no one actually getting the stone.6. How did past!Nebula manage to bring Thanos and Gamora from the past to the future? How did they all have enough Pym Particles? I thought they only had one particle for each of them, so where did Nebula manage to find a spare to give to Thanos and Gamora?7. What was Pepper Potts even doing in the fight? Aside from the plot needing her there so she could witness Tony's final moments? Oh, wait.8. How do the stones even work, anyway? You snap your fingers, you can kill half of a whole planet's population. You snap your fingers, you can also bring back all the people who had been vanished previously? How did they even know they COULD bring everyone back? How did they know they wouldn't just cut the population in half once again?9. I'm curious, what does everyone who's been snapped think about the whole experience? Did they feel anything in those 5 years?And many more, but for now this is it. Personally I think I liked Infinity War better, but oh well.",positive

"We all loved Robert Downey's Ironman, Chris Evans' Captain America, and they left a mark in our hearts that can never be replaced. I will root for the next phase of MCU movies, but I don't think it will have the same allure as the first one.",positive
"I won't include any spoilers. I will say that Endgame fail flat with me. It was a good movie, but nothing close to Infinty Wars. There was no cohesion, the characters were not given that balanced screen time, the cleverness and timely humor wasn't there. The final battle scene was chaotic and didn't showcase enough of the Avengers talents, and what was shown was so fast paced it failed to make an impact. Even though it was a long movie, the entire thing felt rushed.I didn't at all like how they portrayed one of the heroes. And I didn't get a feel for the next generation of Avengers. In fact, of of the most constant icon fans of Marvel movies are used to isn't there.Also, I hated the music. I don't even remembere the famous Avengers theme song being played.There was also quite a bit of predictability with the movie. And there was some dumb things the characters did.Still, this is a must see for fans of the movies. The female empowerment thing carries over from Capt Marvel, but only somewhat. 7/10, and that's a weak 7.",positive

"Like Avengers: Infinity War, it weaves in previous MCU storylines fairly well.Kind of. But unlike that movie, this one goes on a bit too long (nearly 3 hours), with a few too many plotlines that were questionable. Not going to reveal them here, but, suffice it to say, the story was not as well written as in Infinity War, in my opinion. the movie is basically entertaining, but, not really new, and compared to previous Avengers movies, not hardly at all. Time travel is at best a murky addition to any story line. In this situation, time travel renders the majority of the movie sort of confusing.",positive
"It is a soppy story. There was no grit. No realism. No wow moments. Just utter disappointment.They can only go once. Then go a few times.They cannot change the past. Then they change the past.If you change the past, it will change the future... uhm, well let's forget about that and concentrate on special hero stuff and then keep the present as is despite killing the antagonist from the past meaning the future (or present) wouldn't actually be.Then they have these pouted pauses one would expect in soap operas from the 80's. The pouted pauses are with dearest family and friends in a warm sunny glow.The only funny thing, for a moment, was Thor.They could cut the movie by 2h35 and it would be immensely better.",negative

"Proud to have witnessed every moment of this Marvel Universe. It all began with Tony Starks in Ironman and ended with Tony Starks in End Game. Great great movie, comical, drama, action and tears. Loved it a proud to have witnessed cinematic history.",positive
"The movie is 3 hours long. Not once did I look at my watch or feel the need to take a break. You are entertained from the gutsy opening scene to the very last frame.It's funny, it's dramatic and it's larger than life. Everything you might want in an ""end game"" after over ten years of build up.If the movie had a flaw (big IF) is that this is made for the fans that have watched ALL the movies. A billion characters and just as many references and call backs. Unlike the previous movie this one is not a stand alone, you need to know the backstories to understand it..... also the plot is a bit iffy but the movie is so good you sorta give it a pass.If you can actually grab a ticket go see it. This one needs to be seen in the theater to enjoy the epicness on screen.",positive
"I understand that there are still many Marvel films in the works but this really did feel like a conclusion to the 20+ films that came before. Great action sequences with a lot of payoffs for anyone who has seen the previous film and will run you through the entire scope of emotions. There is one seen in particular that was incredible and gave me goosebumps. This is something we've never seen happen before and something we may never again. It really took so many pieces to fall in place and for that this film will stand the test of time and should be considered a milestone event, rather than just a great film. For those reason this is a 10/10 film.",positive

"There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. I haven't laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.**SPOILER ALERT**Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like ""I'm the strongest"" and ""You didn't win because before you didn't have me"" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. Now I get it why the Russo Brothers told us to do a Marvel Movie marathon before watching Endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.Ready or not, whatever it takes.Go watch it for yourself.",positive
"I'm not a fan of the MCU, but I saw all the movies to understand this one and maybe because this type of films are not my type, but every time I analyze the plot of Endgame I like it less because it literally doesn't make any sense.Time travel is one of the most important things to take care of and explained so that the story makes sense, this movie simply tells you 'don't worry about how it works because we will do what we want' that is to say it is used as a resource for make fanservice (I don't dislike it) but it affects the consistency of the plot and the development point of the characters in the previous movies.The Characters; Thor is a character with a clear arc that for some reason they decide to destroy it and use it as a comic relief when he is a very strong character who falls into depression because he has lost everything and apparently that is funny? The sacrifice of Natasha when she began to have a development away from her romance and that apparently being sterile turns a woman into a monster... it feels like a punishment, for which she must pay for what she did because it's treated like she wasn't important, she don't even has a funeral and of course, she deserved be in the final battle. Capitan America arc is about don't given up and accepting what happened to him but he decides gives up and return to the past (I don't know how the Cap that stays in past creating an alternative timeline in a parallel universe appears in the this same timeline but old). The female characters are insignificant or are used as resources so that ""feminist"" scene isn't feminist at all because of how weakly and badly these characters are developed; Captain Marvel is a resource, the deux ex machina that with a solo film that connects her emotionally to the earth and some characters in a interesting way they have been unable to put any reference and show that she is an independent character with a life beyond this event so you don't see her as a real person and she feels off, wasted (love her hairstyle and her new suit, btw); Valkyrie has a minimum of development in thor 3 but not enough to be named queen of Asgard; Nebula is a tortured character that Marvel still doesn't recognize her trauma and how horrible it must be to face her past self and kill her past self for her sister... could be hours talking about the characters and how wrong they made them.The final battle is spectacular and a tribute but I honestly can not understand how a character like Thanos is stronger without the infinity gauntlet than with it or his version of the past without the experience and determination that is achieved with character development and it's feels like is another villain that in IW. When at first they go to find Thanos, this is a character who has sacrificed everything for what he believes is right and as he has fulfilled his goal and has made the world a better place he has no motivation to continue living or fighting. The Thanos of the past is ambitious, not only believes that he is right but it is his destiny, maybe because it is a younger version but in my opinion it breaks the evolution and emotional charge of the villain as well as it happens with confrontation with the heroes since for the heroes the struggle with him is personal for all that he has taken from them but for Thanos it is personal because the heroes frustrate what is his destiny turning into a more cruel version motivated by a sense of entitlement taking away his sense of purpose and objective that the end justifies the means and he's the only one who has what it takes to accomplish this task because he is the only willing to make personal sacrifice for the greater good as opposed to the heroes who are unable to understand it and accept the sacrifice instead oppose it in a way that for Thanos is selfish.That affects the emotional charge in my opinion in the final battle and the development of Thanos, when they involute his development is no longer that well-developed villain that although you may not agree on his methods but his goal is reasonable, This new version of him is caricatured as the bad one simplifying things. The devastating response to Scarlet Witch in the battle when she is facing him for everything that he took away from her and he simply says ""I don't know you"" is the most significant example I can give that the Thanos change affects the emotional charge of the film and the great character that was Thanos in IWI understand that this movie is a closing of an era and a tribute, which for certain moments because the emotion of the end especially with Iron Man, the spectacularity of the final battle, when they believe that everything is lost and those that were missing appear to fight, the team up of the MCU women and all the teamwork to beat Thanos is the best that made me not give much importance to the script and plot problems but when I think about it I can not help but feel that this movie is spectacular, and emotional but also incoherent and a tremendous mess.",positive
"This movie is a screw up for all the movies.This scenario of Time Machine changes the whole concept of the world or the Marvel Universe.If the good guys or super heroes can multiple times change the past, then why can't the bad guys or villains.Of course the heroes return back the item so that, they do not to change the time line.Let's talk about what could happen if Thanos or some mad evil scientist do something far more evil deed in the universe with the use of Time Machine.By chance kill Adam and Eve so that they kill all human existence.Or
Something far greater Sevier he goes on to all planets or universe and kill the first born or species.And so destroys the whole universeNow let's get back to Marvel film.Since we are talking about Time Machine. There will be all the time 2 people exactly the same, one from that period of time {(for marvel Endgame Movie) past} person and the (Future) person.Captain America (future) goes back in the past and marries Peggy Carter and stays in the past also gets back his unbroken shield to Sam Wilson.Doesn't this tamper with the past. Having an extra human being also with the actual Captain America Shield. If means the (past) Captain America doesn't have the Shield.Also Nebula (future) kills the (past) Nebula. Doesn't this erase herself from existence. As without the past self, the future self cannot live on.There was also a scene where Iron Man and Ant Man steals the Space Stone.So a secured and lock briefcase opens with a drop to the ground, without any force. Also Loki disappeared with the Space Stone in 2012 which will also cause problem with the time vortex. As something happened that weren't suppose to happen.Also the Avengers all get their stones without any hassle or fight. Something spicy should have been added.What I mean is new villain.It looks as if Marvel was in a hurry to wind up all years and years of work in 1 last film untill the new phase starts.",negative
"If you're a Marvel fan, this movie literally has everything. Nothing is left out. No stone unturned and all are cared for with incredible deftness. To weave together 21 movies into one HUGE and epic finale, while very properly tying up loose ends, is just beyond impressive. The cheers, the sacrifices, the resolutions, all are so very well done for this type of genre. This movie entertains on a scale that ""hitherto"" has never been seen. Lol. No other movie franchise has come close to matching the MCU magic, and none ever will. This was very special and a masterful piece of comic book action movie making.",positive
"No spoilers.
This movie is fabulous. From beginning to end you are inthralled with intrigue. From time to time you may be crying to laughing within seconds. The special effects and character interactions are also very well done. I highly recommend this movie.",positive
"Watching Avengers Endgame would go down as the experience of a lifetime, which will give you gamut of emotions ranging from laughter, goosebumps , crying and lots of crying.
It is a great send off to some of our heroes. There is so much to write but i dont want to ruin anyone else's experience.
Well Done Marvel....... :)",positive

"I would like to discuss the movie ""Avengers 4: Finale"" (2019). The Avengers succeeded, but the sediment honestly remained. There is too much pessimism and despondency, the film is saturated. The feeling of hopelessness did not leave at all, even when something was going well. It can be seen that everything is difficult for the remaining avengers, every action, every step. There is no lightness, there are few jokes. I'm not talking about the final at all. Like a knife to the heart... the loss of two beloved characters... this is too much(But as it is, the actors, as always, are on top. The special effects are super, there's nothing to talk about, the work of the operators is excellent! Everything is very spectacular, dynamic. It is worth noting that although the film is long, time flies by unnoticed. It certainly wasn't boring. Yes, and the film is not for once, to tell the truth, you can still watch a couple of times.It's a pity that such a long and beloved story ended. I love these movies.",positive
"Great closure, amazing movie. Just the right ending for a 22 movie saga.",positive
I was very excited for this movie but i was a bit disappointed. Didn't do justice to hulk. We don't see him in action and no character development for how he became professor hulk and not satisfied with treatment to Thor as he was fat in movie. Overall was entertaining to watch.,positive
"Insane. Unbelievable. Phenomenal. They pulled it off. The biggest cinematic event in history. What a solid and well deserved conclusion to a 22 film universe.
Wow.
Really can't explain how somberly epic this movie was. Remarkable. The Russo Brothers have made an extraordinary masterpiece spanning two films that each individually standalone yet mesh together to create a fantastically awesome ending to a saga. A saga built by Stan Lee and carried on through many creative minds in the film industry who have tirelessly work to give the world something new. And boy did they achieve just that.
Wow.
The pacing made this three hour and fifty-six second blockbuster fly by faster than a snap-okay maybe not that fast. But what incredible editing; the cinematography juxtaposed looked amazing and flowed very smoothly. As daunting as the huge task to make this movie was, the filmmakers took it by the horns and owned it. Outstanding.
One to watch over and over again; enjoying newly found one-liners and moments that were not seen before. Discussions will arise, and that's what the best movies always conjure. However far fetched into the future of Marvel movies or the MCU that these audience discussions go, they all have to agree that this was truly a perfect endgame.
Heart-warming and grounded; explosive and sensational. This movie literally encompasses it all with an ending to the endgame that will, most definitely, both hold your breath and then take it away, as your jaw drops to the floor. The most iconic, astronomical, epic, glorious, marvelous, a-vengeful third act that will be nearly impossible to ever beat since it is the culmination of over a decade's worth of unparalleled hard work.
Avengers: Endgame deserves all the hype and all the soon-to-come broken box office records since it has surpassed all expectations and delivered something unique-which is just about all anyone can ask for from filmmakers. Officially declared as the best this year, so far, yet confidently declared as the biggest monumental event in cinematic history.
Loved it three thousand.
Wow.

"I wanted this movie to be the the ending that was deserved. The film is ok but it's not even close to infinity war.
This film feels rushed. The way Tony works out time travel just felt overly convenient. The middle portion of the film was ok and the where a few nice moment, but as we progress through this we are left with more and more questions.
A fat Thor and professor hulk was awkward and unecessary and they where only there to force some luaghs.
The final battle, the bit we where building up to, the final stand off between good and evil. This was the most disappointing part of all. Avengers Vs Thanos and his army. And then completely out of the blue every one else was there as well. This felt like they only used the battle to show horn everybody else's in. It was very messy and confusing at time the camera moved so fast we couldn't tell who was who.
I wanted this film to close the door on this phase of the franchise, but all it does is open more doors and behind these more questions.
While this is an ok film in feel we have been short changed.",positive
What have all these peeps seen in this movie i was soooo bored i fell asleep its a waste of3 hours of my life...pls dont waste ur 3 hrs on this,negative
"I always pity releases on same weekends with the Avengers franchise still playing.What does this release has for fans especially you reading this review?My response is simply. It has everything you need in a single motion.From casting to directing.With great characters coordination,an exemplary to the saying that biggest stars shine brighest before they die.Screenplay and dialogue great,setting and cinematography excellent,costume and editing faultless. The dark side has to do with acting,at particular point in time,one could see hyper-performances where it was not neccessary.Great movie,spotless in all dimensions of movie making",positive
"The final chapter of Marvel's Phase Three of the MCU has everything that a fan of these movies wants! It has an ending for the ages and Easter eggs to many to count. It took 21 movies to get there, so filled with to the brim with callbacks to previous movies and it gives a ending to numerous story arcs in a satisfied way. As usual, Marvel knocks it out of the park with a blockbuster that looks impressive, has an incredible cast, iconic characters and a story that will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat for all of the 3 hour run-time.",positive
"Y'all..the ONLY reason I gave it a 9/10 was because I hated fat Thor. Honestly besides that I was amazed. Started off oddly quick and then slowed way down, but it kept me guessing the whole time. Most of the time I never knew why was gonna happen next!",positive
"SCORE: 10/10I did Infinity War for my 100th unique movie review, so you know I had to do Engame for #200. What a movie. In my opinion, this is peak Marvel and the best Marvel movie that has been created up to this point. Everyone knows just how amazing the theater experience was watching this for the first time, but it has definitely stood the test of time. I was actually sitting watching the first part of the movie with the original script right in front of me, and it is crazy to see some of the stuff they took out, which was mainly more comedic lines from Tony Stark and Scott Lang. But, I guess it was to keep a relatively more serious tone to it. The first part of this movie, admittedly, did start off a bit slow. Infinity War was going to be an incredibly tough act to follow, and they had to set up the stakes and the situation after Thanos had won. However, after the first hour of this movie, the last 2 hours are, in my opinion, the best 2 hours of film that have ever been created.It is so easy to get lost in everything going on with how big of a spectacle Endgame is and completely forget everything that had been done to get to this moment. Along with the perfect casting of actors who play the roles in the MCU, each character had been developed perfectly, each with their own unique back story and characteristics that make them different. Iron Man's death and sacrifice was the perfect end to his character arc, which started with him in that cave, to saving the Avengers the first time, to going against Cap in Civil War, and now him ultimately making the sacrifice play. I don't remember Iron Man's death hitting me as hard as it did, but I was uncontrollably sobbing for entire last part of this movie. Watching all the Avengers and their families at Tony's house allowed the audience to stop and realize how much had been put into this Cinematic Universe and how truly special both Marvel and Iron Man are.The second and third act were a perfect combination of creativity and epicness. The time heist was genius, with so many iconic scenes from both the first Avengers movie and the decision to have them go back in time after Loki escapes with the Space Stone. Speaking of Loki, it's so cool to see how much the movies and TV shows for Marvel connect together, something that Marvel has the unique ability to do given the amount of projects it has. With each stone we get to see an amazing moment in Marvel history, including Captain America ending up back in the elevator with the Mind Stone in Loki's Scepter and saying ""Hail Hydra"", Peter Quill's journey to the Power Stone, the Ancient One holding the Time Stone 5 years before Dr. Strange even existed, Thor reuniting with his mother before extracting the Aether from Jane, and the highly emotional scene of Black Widow sacrificing her life for the Soul Stone. And then, the most iconic scene in movie history occurs with everyone coming through the Portals. The amount of pre work that had to be done to get to that moment is immeasurable and was the moment that Marvel commented itself in movie history. If it wasn't cool enough to discover that Captain America was worthy to wield Mjölnir, he gets to do the honors of leading the Avengers into the final battle, where we get to see just how special each character is and their own unique abilities. This was the perfect end to the Infinity Saga and one of the greatest movies ever to be made. Let's see if Secret Wars can top it!",positive
"The perfect conclusion, that pretty much sums it up. Over ten years and more then 20 movies led to this moment. Similarly to Infinity War, End Game had a lot of hype to live up to, and it did so seemingly effortlessly.
The story, which on paper sounds quite simple, get the stones back and fix everything, takes some unexpected turns here and there and I have to applaud the filmmakers for making it so damn entertaining.
The movie shines in being extremely funny, heartbreakingly sad and also filled to the brim with pulse-pounding action. The cast, which we know so well, all work with each other seamlessly. Special shoutout to Robert Downey Jr for giving by far his most vulnerable and amazing performance as Iron Man thus far.
The climax of the film is one for the ages, similar to the final battle in Return of the King.
The special effects, the score and the editing were naturally amazing, nothing less than expected from what these filmmakers have given us before.
There is also plenty of fan service, sometimes a little too on the nose, but the plot and the characters are treated with the respect the Russo's have earlier shown to have for the franchise.
Whatever turn the franchise takes after this, it will probably be exhilarating.",positive
"People had been speculating over what has happened, and what will happen.
Some were bang on, others missed it by whiskers and despite all the ideas out there, the film manages to surprise.Then you realize this grand send off, has so much to offer as a movie that it becomes a milestone.
Can it get better from here on? You never know, 2012 Avengers 1 was kind of the perfect film, until some other great films rocked our imagination.The first half was a bit dragged. The second half was too filled with awesome moments.The best for me was when Captain America lifts Thor's Hammer and goes up against Thanos. The heart break moment was of course Iron Man though even Black Widow attained martyrdom.All in on a spectacle for those who started with Iron man and saw all the films up to this one!",positive
"I had high hopes.The cinematography and effects are the high-point for me. I had the opportunity to watch a 3D showing at an IMAX. No disappointment there.The cast of characters is great. The actors playing the characters are all very good. The cast is impressive. Contrary to some reviewers I even enjoyed the comic relief provided by the fat, pensive, alcoholic version of Thor.The problem for me is that Endgame dilutes the sinister conclusion of Infinity War. I loved the ending of Infinity War. When I finally decided to see Infinity War on Netflix I wasn't expecting an ending from a Marvel movie that would ask difficult questions about morality and perspective. What was annoying about Endgame is that the story uses a hokey motif like time travel to unwind the dark and sinister implications of Infinity War. It takes the uneasy moral questions left at the end of Infinity War and transforms the narrative into a flattened, predictable superhero formula written to please mass audiences.",positive
Absolutely speechless.... I have no words to express the absolute masterpiece that marvel has created. Exceptional!,positive
"Avengers Endgame for me, was good but not so good, it was fun but not so fun, it was exciting but not so exiting, it was emotional but just a little bit. From the get go it tries to establish things that are confusing. For me it broke the #1 code that made Marval movie great - don't break your own fictional universe's rules. Endgame breaks quite a few rules and I ended up at the finale waiting for explanation which never really fully came.I did enjoy the movie, and at parts the movie delivered what it promised but it's by no means as great as I was hoping it would be.For years we fans have speculated and analyzed what would happen. Take any simplest of the theory and that is what happens. It left me disappointed. It left me disappointed that Russo brothers went with a average at best storyline.Infinity War was sort of a standalone movie, a person with basic knowledge of previous movies could watch it and enjoy it. This one, you need to know the entire plot until now. Even then this movie is not as good as the previous avenger movies.Endgame is good and has lots of fan service but the humor seems forced and the story seems questionable. It might have worked if it didn't have such grand expectations but since it does, it is still a disappointment for me.Verdict: 6/10",positive
"The starting scene with Hawk Eye was absolutely great, we were all wondering about questions how would post apocalyptic universe of Marvel looks like, what happened after the slick? We got those answer by a stunning, realistic, dramatic starting scene.However, devolopment phase of the movie is a SCANDAL. Too many boring staff going on, trying to find a solution for the making the world nice again (I should say that post apocalyptic scenes are really illogical, people still sorrow after 5 years later and there is nothing going on the world except japan mafia. LOL) and they come up with a idea of TIME MACHINE.Top level of creativity showed itself around here. Thanks to script writers nice job!Two geniuses, Mark Ruffalo and Robert D. Jr. figures out quickly principles of time travel and team gathers up together for the ENDGAME. Wow.Conclusion phase of the movie was a disaster as well. Not gonna get into too much detail but everything should be ended differently if you consider all knowledge we gathered from Doctor Strange and Thanos.Captain Marvel wouldn't showed up in the Infinity Wars Thanos Fight last time because she was busy with ""Universe Problems"" while half of all living being destroyed, Thanks for the OP character to getting involved to that case in the second time, and all is well again. Movie finishes just like my review finishes.People are not evaluating the movie, they are just here to applause everything that were made from Marvel. They think this movie is the last Avengers movie. Thanks to those DUMBS (Sorry for my real opinion) economics of the Avengers movies will always be profitable.",negative
"This movie is so good that I literally began to shake in the final battle (adrenaline rush) in fact I almost pissed myself. Not because I wanted to go to the toilet but because of the thrill, shock and excitement throughout. Be prepared.",positive
It's the end of the story and the superhero. The old story is over and the new one is about to start. Let's take a few more steps on the path of memory. Old friends meet again. People who want to be superheroes become real superheroes. Lost time is also picked up in another parallel universe. There is no better ending.,positive
"This was movie was the perfect way to bring together everyone, let's us know how about many of the Avengers including how the years since the snap has affected them and it allows them the ability to resolve or revisit their past.

Avengers endgame was part of the marvel movie franchise it was an overall amazing movie and I am very impressed with the the acting there were a few plot holes and some unanswered questions but other then that it would be a 9/10.,positive
"This movie was a collection of some past marvel sequels.(Avengers,Captain America,Thor,Guardians of the Galaxy)There are some scenes where you will say OMG,if it wasn't you are not a marvel fan.I am not going to post spoilers but remember doctor strange saw a one in a million posibility before he gave up the time stone to save ""Tony Stark"" in Infinity War.You would understand the reason in Endgame.",positive
I seen this in the theaters and let me tell you this was the most mixed emotion movie ever this movie had me crying especially at the end and there were some parts that were heart raceing and another part were it was funny so all around i supper recommend to watch this movie it will have you in love it has alot of action,positive
"In my point of view , this avengers was not thought up well. Going back to the past to save the world? Seriously? The previous part Thanos tried so much to get the stones and this part he regret what he did?",positive
"Actually marvel did a good job with this movie
Like actors and directors and visual parts
It deserves a high rating.",positive
"Finally after the 10 year build up, Endgame busts the expectations and as a movie goer Ieaves me satisfied. However, as a fan, severely disappointed. I'm going to deeply analize the 5 points that made Endgame experience a fatality for a long time Marvel fan.
1.Thanos character was reduced to a generic lifeless villian.
Remeber in Infinity War how we could sympathize with Thanos as a character despite his actions and sociopathy? He had a solid motivation and his lines were truly something that made rewatching the film worth it. Endgame literally decapitates him in the first 10 minutes, by our ""heroes"" were he was just making himself a broth with one-arm, to add, at the point it felt the Avengers were just bullying him,again, to add insult to injury as Thor axed him it really felt the movie was portraying the Avengers as the villians.
Then the film decides to place a past Thanos as the main villian, which would have been fine, if he actually had something interesting to say besides that he was going to destroy the whole universe and remake it. As if that wasn't bad enough, if the present Thanos was left alive, it wouldn't have made any difference, to the contrary, it would have been interesting to see what he had to say if he saw past Gamora alive, and make him feel the regret he felt when he won, but then again, we wouldn't have our epic final battle with the explosions and the female power moment, because that's worth the 3 hours.2. The most iconic Marvel characters Hulk and Thor were completely slaughtered and insultingly mocked.
Have you ever wondered how interesting it would be if Marvel made a comic about a videogame playing-basement dwelling Thor and a... I forgot the Professor Hulk comic is actually a thi- Never mind. Point being. Did you love to watch Bruce Banner overcome his psychological fear of controlling the Hulk like in the original Avengers movie? Did you also love how Thor was able to move on from losing his kingdom, his family, and friends and continue his quest for not being a disappointment to Odin in Ragnarok?
Well... throw all of that to the garbage disposal, because this movie gave us FaThor playing Fortnite and Dabbing Professor Hulk instead. I really feel like I shouldn't explain this further, people...3.I thought deaths didn't matter in the MCU?
So let's count the total Infinity War and Endgame death toll... Gamora, many Asgardians and Loki, Vision, Iron Man, and Black Widow, if I forgot anyone else it means I really don't care for them. These are the ones who didn't actually come back to life with the snap. Ok, fine, but why the deaths felt heavier in Infinity War, were we knew they could be brought back, but then they felt out of nowhere in this film? That's it, maybe because the deaths were handled better in Infinity War.
If you rewatch Infinity War, you might notice the characters who saw their loved ones die, had the emotional outbreak we expected they were going to have, making an impact on the audience, there was literally no emotional impact on the deaths scenes of this film, because it felt it had to move quickly to the next scene to make space for the fan service.4.The time travel completely makes the film fall in Men in Black 3 levels of logical inconsistency
So as you might realize, I'm not a fan of time travel in film, unless it follows the Back to the Future formula or the first two Terminator movies, but unless a movie decides to change its rules midway I'll competely disregard the movie as food for thought when it comes to fixing its own plot holes.
For starters, if you're gonna pull the alternate universe travel formula, I'm fine with it, but then you base the science on the fact that Ant-Man traveled 5 years to the future in five hours, but then they come to the conclusion that with such logic they can travel to the past... It's out of nowhere really. You could actually come with a better plot device with the time stone, it was supposed to be there for a reason, Dr. Strange himself gave it away for something, but then you literally use a rat to determine time travel is possible... yeah, what a mess...
As I was saying, if the alt universe in the film was consistent, I'd be fine with it, but then we wouldn't have old Steve Rogers sitting on a bench in the same dimension! Instead of making him teleport back to the platform as an old man, which would have been even better, but then we come to the conclusion that the alternate universe he traveled to is the same one? Nope...
BTW As he is giving his identity to someone else, as a side note, I thought Bucky was supposed to be the next Captain America, you know Steve Rogers' best friend, oh sorry, I forgot there must be a Black Captain America to pander to minorities, would that make me racist, Brie Larson? My bad.
If anything time travel works better in X-Men Days of Future past, because a single character went back in time to a key moment, allowing it to create good scenarios between the characters, Tony could have literally used the time stone to go alone back in time as his young self to the New York Battle and confiscate the stones and destroy them, but then again, we wouldn't have the final epic battle scene, right?5. Captain Marvel
Nothing against our activist and feminist Brie Larson, I'm sure she has made great films in the past, but as you see, I really couldn't understand how her presence was required in this film, as she comes in, leaves during all the second act, then returns out of nowhere and has no weight to the plot of the film.
The thing to like about the Avengers characters is that their interactions and that they have relationships between each other. Captain Marvel has no deep connection with any character on the film whatsoever, hell, she barely has anything to do with the plot more than rescuing Tony from space, which adds to the question, how did she know where to find him? Oh excuse me if I should watch Captain Marvel to know... because I didn't watch it, did that gave me a problem to understand this film? Absolutely not. I fear the reason for her placement was for something other than the fact she's a female, but then again I'd be called a bigot for adding the observation, as I take it back I might add, Thanos really kicked her ass, didn't he? So much for the most powerful Marvel hero.That's my review, I don't think many people will read it, but I wanted to vent the frustration this film gave me, I must add I still enjoyed the film generally as a casual movie goer, I'm glad it exists, and I'm glad people enjoyed it, because it marks the end of an iconic era, and I have hope that filmmakers will move on from the cinematic universe trend and start making movies as their own and admire Infinity War as the pinnacle of such an achievement as nothing will top it. I'm sure Stan Lee is smiling in heaven for that.",positive
"I can't believe this movie got a so hight raring. Even hours of this trash can't compete with 15 minutes of other masterpieces that sadly no one talks about. The average audience, who wouldn't even distinguish wes Anderson from Tarantino, cares to write unwarranted reviews, and the fact that the most famous platform in the world (and the last word on the success of a movie or not) allows it, in my opinion, It's an affront to the art of cinema.",negative
"This was the end game. Beautiful, emotional, loving, lots of action, I cried, I'm sad but satisfied and super happy ❤❤❤ I dont have words to explain, well I cant explane words or no words.You just have to watch it!You'll see for yourself It's worth it and I maybe will go 2 more times to the theatre so much did I like it. Please give them Emmy awards!",positive
"Since the first Iron Man movie I was a big fan of the show. It was a very good movie with lots of good moments, but i have to say after Infinity war I feel disappointed.First of all I felt like the avengers cheated. They say that they got only 1 shot at it, because they have only so much of the stuff, (which sounds unfulfilling for me already) but then they just go back and grab more, so if they just grab 1 extra every time (its not the same timeline, infinite timelines) they can get as many shots as they want. They also don't wanna bother the other timelines, but they end up screwing that timeline big time. Cap is at the lake so he has gone back to their original timeline (which Bruce said isn't the case with time travel, as they went back those events didn't happen in the orignial timeline, so it had to be another one). There are other examples I could list. So i feel that with time-travel they just took a too big bite, it just cannot be explained in two sentences, whole movies/movie series incorporate the idea of course it will feel off for any viewer who can't help themselves not to think.They kinda murdered the character of Thanos for me. Thanos was the guy who saw it as his duty to save the universe from itself sacrificing whatever it takes, even his most precious daughter. He respected Stark to the very end of Infinity War. Everything he did felt rational. But in Endgame his conversations get all angry, subjective and unreasonable. You obviously don't have to destroy the whole world and rebuild it just because some superintelligent fellow with friends who had personal interests, figured out a way to fight back.Thor was also strangely treated. It was funny that he got fat and all (which i don't know how the Thor fans feel about), but why didn't he get back inot shape for battle or at least try? Also back in Infinity War he oneshotted Thanos even with the full gauntlet, and now he didnt stand a chance (if you say he suprised him then remember, he caught the axe many times while he was turned around). Obviously you can say after this that he was weaker since he was fat etc. but then they could just wait for him to get into shape etc.. Furthermore, if Cap got the powers of Thor and can handle both of his weapons then Thor becomes pretty degraded.On the bright side i have to give a huge credit for the character developments, they nailed them. The fight scenes felt better than ever. They made Antman feel epic after joking about him. So many epic moments, Cap with the broken shield and that iron man line with the snap just amazing.",positive
"""Avengers: Endgame"" did the un-thinkable, it was a thrilling conclusion to 2018's ""Avengers: Infinity War"", and concluded the character arches to Marvel favorites, Iron Man, Captain America, and Black Widow. The M.C.U (Marvel Cinematic Universe) started in 2008 with Robert Downey Jr. starting in the title role of ""Iron Man"" and 22 films later and over a decade of time has changed both Hollywood and audience's expectations forever. The film directed by Joe and Anthony Russo tells an exciting and emotional story that also gives Marvel fans exactly what they would want with multiple fanboy/girl moments and Easter eggs throughout. The film works on so many levels, but the highlight is the emotional impact the concluding arches of these characters. With so many films for fans to get-to-know, and understand these characters, it almost feels like watching one's best friend or family member go through the on-screen drama that unfolds. This may not be the end of the M.C.U., but it is the end of a very special era for comic book and movie fans.",positive
"Endgame is the best Marvel movie ever, that simple. Very funny, very emocional. Awesome soundtrack. And the last 50 minutes....OMG.",positive
"Last year I watched Infinity War on opening day in theatres and was amazed by it. Of course it was flawed and those flaws did bother me but it was still incredible. I just watched Endgame and this film made Infinity War look like Thor: The Dark World.Endgame is a stellar film, through its spectacular visuals, charming characters, epic fight scenes and engrossing narrative. It is a film that shouldn't be possible. If someone told me about this film ten years ago and said it was actually great, I would have laughed in their face. Yet somehow a film of this scale, ten years in the making, was masterfully executed. There was a lot I expected to happen that did but there was tons more I never thought would happen that completely caught me by surprise which is what I truly love about this film.The first two acts were great, they drove the story forward and gave us some great character moments. The first scene in the film, gave me the first out of many tears that would shed throughout the film. Honestly I have never cried this much in a movie and I would have never thought this would be the film that would make me do that. However the first two acts were flawed, there were a few pacing issues here and there, some problems with the narrative in terms of developing some character moments and other issues.However by the third act those problems were completely forgotten. The third act was so grand and epic and was one of the best final hours I have ever witnessed in a movie ever. I would love to talk about it but I am keeping things spoiler three. Just know that you could never imagine how effing spectacular it is. I certainly didn't.The ending in particular was emotional, heartfelt and immensely engrossing. It was a well deserved pay-off to these last ten years of films and a great satisfying end to it all.
Overall Avengers: Endgame is a film that not only surpassed my expectations, but is also a flawed masterpiece. To this day I would have never thought I would want to give a film this flawed an 11/10.",positive

"The title more or less says it all. In my opinion it wasn't as well paced as the last Avengers and since the Thanos of this movie is technically a different version of him the stakes towards the end don't feel as high as they could've been. I'd say this movie would've been significantly improved with either the lack of a main villain, massive CGI mess of a battle at the end or neither. This movie also goes out of it's way to make it's rules of time travel clear and how it isn't like other movies, but then goes on to contradict itself and in the end they actually could've gone back in time and killed baby Thanos like Don Cheadle suggested.",positive
"It,s very great movie and every scence i,ve been so suprised and my body was stinging. It had so many good action scenes that the viewer could be on the screen all the time. For me, for the first time in the battle scene, the last of some things were predictable for me, but after the iron man broke, I really did not expect what happened. Natasha's death was also very sad.It had so many good action scenes that the viewer could be on the screen all the time.

"So..um...other than to wrecked up Thanos's battle ship, Captain Marvel should be the one who defeat Thanos, right? That's what all the fuss about, right?? She's not supposed to be taken down so easily, right?? If she were strong enough, Tony wouldn't be dead, right?????I thougth Capt. Marvel is the one who will deafeat Thanos, i wonder how will it be. Then POOF! In the end the stones did the job.Omg..so confused...",negative
Avengers: Endgame was mindblowing and awesome. It is the best MCU movie ever. It is even better than Avengers: Infinity War and it exceeded my wildest expectation.,positive
Wow. Wow. I was amazed and feeling great after watching this film . An epic Endgame . This time our superheroes had save the humanity . This is great in its own . You will love the character which you hadn't love them till now . Like Captain marvel she was fantastic . They showed her that how great she was . Which we missed in her own movie. This movie is slow in first 2 hours . But that has to be done because they wanna show that what thanos had done . How the all avengers unite again and fight against thanos army . It give goosebumps when stark and NAT died and cap also (but he is still alive) . This is gonna great treat for all marvel diehard fans including me too . Endgame gonna beat avatar this time . And it has done too . Really a great film . Thanks to Russo brothers who had directed it so well and all the actors who had great acting . So finally a masterpiece,positive

"Avengers: Endgame brings the Avengers and their allies together again in an attempt to reverse the damage caused by Thanos in the previous film, Infinity War. The massive ensemble cast, including all the original team played by Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner, along with many more fantastic actors like Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, and Josh Brolin, among many others, created a really thrilling and memorable experience.The special effects and action sequences are tremendous and provide a visual feast for the eyes. The use of humor and emotional moments, combined with its epic scope, create a powerful and satisfying conclusion to the MCU's ""Infinity Stones"" story arc that began with Iron Man back in 2008. The film's pace is both brisk and engaging, and its large cast is well-utilized despite its size, and I did actually feel that each character got their moment to shine.In conclusion, Endgame is an absolute must-see film for fans of superhero movies and anyone who has been following the MCU. The film's powerful conclusion to the Infinity arc and its huge massively talented cast make it a classic that will continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.",positive
"No spoilers.This film is genuinely incredible, absolutely perfect end to the chapter. The movie ties up loose ends you don't even know are loose, it's just fantastic. Really couldn't rate this film any higher, an emotional range as broad as you'd expect from Marvel. . Laughter, tears, and elation all in a matter of minutes. Go watch it!",positive
"Like most, I had very little idea what to expect going into Endgame other than vague theories and hoping it would be great (mainly because of the Russo brothers and how good Infinity War was). It really blew me away and I feel like I'm still processing it the next day.The movie takes its time but this makes sense for the story it's telling. We feel the impact of the previous movie's events. We feel the loss and confusion. There are dead-ends and good reasons for characters to lose hope and accept their situation.All the characters get shining moments, comedically and heroically, and without sacrificing who they are. The plot twists and turns in ways I hadn't anticipated and which make your heart skip a beat. It has some of the funniest moments in any MCU movie, but none of them detracts from the overall mood. The stakes are higher than ever with lots of ups and downs and close calls.There are some very touching character moments which work by themselves but are even more meaningful in the wider context of what happens. Every scene is there for a reason and helps increase the impact of a later or earlier part. I was reminded of LotR: The Return of the King in the grand scale of some parts of Endgame. Few movies can give you chills on that level. I found it darker and more intense than Infinity War. Other movies like Schindler's List, Forrest Gump and E.T. also affected me deeply and Endgame now joins that list.There may well be plot holes, but it's not hard to suspend disbelief or come up with ways to understand them. The important thing is that we get what's going on at any given point in time and feel that the character's generally make logical choices. The villain(s) are intimidating and intelligent, not wasting any time to use whatever advantages they have. The heroes also have a sense of urgency and pull off some brilliant stunts - there are a lot of satisfying, earned, crowd-pleasing moments.This certainly feels like the end of an era for multiple reasons. It's a great send-off for some characters especially and sets the bar extremely high in terms of action, creativity and raw emotion for future MCU and other superhero movies.",positive
"The visual effects are spot on, as usually.
The 6/10 ranking has to due with Captain America ending.He ended up with Peggy, meaning he did not grow at all. He was still stuck in the past and life is about dealing with new circumstances and understand some doors are closed forever. Not only that, Peggy's story as a brave independent woman who fought for a better world loses some meaning.
It is also hard to believe Steve Rogers would stay quiet during 70+ years whilst Peggy would do the hard work.
Steve Rogers's ending is lazy, incoherent and cliche.Black Widow dies, sacrificing herself, meaning any solo movie with her is meaningless. Her death as some sense, but it still feels empty.Tony Stark also dies, after having a happy ending (at the beginning of the movie). I believe this death is going to be divisive.The loopholes with time travel are there (how does Peter resume his life with the same colleagues?) and are kinda disappointing the more you think about them.Marvel really went for the pockets of the consumers and didn't put in the effort to tide things up orderly.",positive
"I'll be honest and if people hate me, whatever. If you don't love this movie you are not a true fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This is what we've been waiting for. This is it. It's the perfect MCU movie. It is literally everything we ever wanted and everything we could ever ask for. It's everything. It's the most important comic book movie there is.It's Marvel's truest identity. You laugh so hard the you jerk out in your seat. You're jaw drops from how shockingly awesome it is. You cry because of the joy fullness you're witnessing. And you cry for a happy sadness that is the ending of an era.There is not one thing I can think of that would be considered a negative. I can finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.",positive
"This may the first movie where I loved maybe 98% of its scenes, but not the movie itself. A collection of great moments and even well-deserved fan-service does not mean a movie is good. Did I enjoy all the time-travel scenes and glorious interactions that led to? Yes! Do I still think time-travel of this scale is the worst idea in the MCU? Also yes.Why? Because the MCU's timeline is chock-full of crucial events and great threats overcome at great expenses. This time-travel is supposed to be different from what is normally portrayed or believed, yet they barely spent any time to explain it. Our seasoned Avengers just quickly assume absolutely nothing could go wrong if they change things and just jump into it?Also, those scenes while fun are the kind of scenes you expect to see in parodies or what-if scenario skits on talk-shows - not in the actual movie.
Thanos's quick initial death seems like the MCU trying to pull off a GoT by resorting to cheap shock-tactics. Unfit-Thor and the selfie-taking Professor Hulk are like good comedy bits I'd expect to see on Jimmy Kimmel or a HISHE parody video. Wasn't Cap dating Agent Carter's niece? When did he go back to pining for Peggy again? She moved on after Cap. There was a whole TV show about it. Talking of TV shows, I hear there is going to one with Peggy and Cap - I thought Evans wanted to stop playing Cap? How much of this story was decided by Disney's upcoming new streaming service? Finally, the whole time-travel arc obviously releases a whole another can-of-worms with questions and plot holes and inconsistencies etc. that I am not going to go into.I feel like the movie sacrificed its pace and good story-telling for moments such as this - Marvel movies were increasingly beginning to show a tendency of trying too hard to be funny at the expense of any story-telling impact and this really went too far.I wish the movie was different. I wish the time-jump was much shorter - maybe 6 months. That Thor was being the hero he is and helping people in the aftermath of the Decimation. That instead of altering (or something) all of the MCU timeline, they showed the whole world was falling apart after losing half of it and the Avengers were exhausted trying to patch things when they rollback time to 6 months ago and find a solution from there. I wish the movie ended happily with everyone intact. I wish I didn't leave the theatre feeling like I watched an expensive spoof.",positive
"Highlights of why it's terrible.Infinity stones control the flow of the universe and cannot be removed (sorceress supreme - endgame), I destroyed the stones (Thanos - endgame).Killing yourself while someone tries to stop you is not the other person making a sacrifice (soul stone would not be acquired)A sword cannot cut vibranium, jesus thors hammer doesn't scratch the ain't (Thanos America)Scarlet witch can easily kill Thanos so why doesn't she finish the job.The power of the gauntlet is the user can harness the power of the stones without being affected by them. (iron man and hulk would be unharmed, Thanos was only injured because he was trying to destroy them, he explains this at the start)An android linked to a cloud would know that she is and would switch off her WiFi.Someone who would contaminate 50 years of history because he misses his girlfriend is a personality trait that would prevent them being able to wield thors hammer.There are hundreds of inconsistencies compared to the established universe, if you are giving this film a ten star rating take off your rose tinted glasses.",negative
"Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Avengers: Endgame. For once I am at a loss for words. I have just sat through three hours of an absolute roller coaster of emotions. I laughed, I cried, there was shock, relief, and sorrow and just a little bit of awe. I have an immense amount of praise for the writers being able to draw the threads of the story together to produce such an outcome. For those of us that love the Marvel universe, I say Wow!!!!! I really can't think of anything else to say without a huge bunch of spoilers so I'm just going to say, if this is your thing......it was awesome......please go any watch it.....then go and watch it again!!!!",positive
Avengers End Game is by far the most gorgeous and detailed Cinematic movie ever. Full of emotions and a true character representation. No unnecessary scenes and a true reflection of the hardwork of the MCU. This blissful. Everyone deserves to watch this magnificent piece.,positive
"THAT is how a movie should be made. Explains a lot with addition to more. Humor, drama, action, Sci-Fi, excellent CGI as always, even thrilling at times. Overall a perfect movie for what it is.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame was made by the cast and crew of Infinity War and is the last film of Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Endgame, as the last film, offers an utterly unpredictable, ambitious and unique story that pleasurably ends the saga. The feeling of catharsis is present throughout the film. Each character has a character arc with some that isn't present in the preceding films.The visuals of the film improved from Infinity War. Some scenes offered CGI heavy scenes that almost felt like a comic book. More ""comic-bookey"" from the previous films.The tone of the film is probably the darkest of the whole MCU but still has a lot of humor sprinkled throughout, which all of them worked. The performances of the cast were the best they've ever been, giving their characters more layers than it's ever been.Endgame is a very cathartic film for old and new fans alike. With some devastating moments, it is a very emotionally satisfying film that every Marvel and movie fans need to see. The eleven years of build up and characterization has paid off in this very historic comic book movie. It is by far, the best MCU and the best comic movie we have.-Yman Dayawon",positive
"I was pessimistic and fatigued with Marvel in the past few years, but Endgame is the most enjoyable movie since the original standalone films way back when the MCU was first being set up. Where Infinity War was lacking in terms of tension, Endgame picks up the slack, with tightly bound scenes and interesting twists and turns. Characters act in logical ways and it is simply a joy experiencing and sharing in their time on screen. This was a far more fulfilling experience than I expected and I was really won over by the fantastic acting and the meticulous attention to detail in every scene.",positive
11 years in making n it was really worth a wait!! its simply the best marvel movie till date!! tears all the way!!! excitement n sadness n joy at full peak!! n guess what?! brie larson is right there as we wanted her to be!!! spot on!! the best version of captain marvel we can get!! avengers endgame is will pull the inner fan out of you at fullest!!,positive
"I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.
Time travel destroys any film...time travel doesnt exist in the physical world..",positive
I couldn't have imagined a better conclusion to the Infinity Stones saga. This movie has everything and hits all the right emotional beats along the way. I can't wait to see it again!,positive
The pacing in this movie is flawed. The humour is forced. But this finale is fitting and satisfying,positive
"So I just waisted 5 precious minutes of my life. This superwoman character is absolutely not credible! Come on, she is not destructible, she has no limits, she can go light years in space and bring on her shoulders a whole spaceship back to earth...no, why make a whole movie, and involve and kill a bunch of other way cooler and believable characters on the way, when you can just use this, the one and only, incredible all-can-do woman and just finish the film in 5 minutes. It makes no sense what you people did there. Even Superman had his limits, and was vulnerable and felt real, we were glad to accept him as a hero, because he felt like one of us. But she, she is nothing like us, humans, so I just don't get it. Sorry, one star for this nonsensical thing you call Avengers: Endgame. And yes, my rating is based on 5 minutes watching, but it is like reading a book - if you don't like the first pages, you won't fall for the rest of it...",negative
"As soon as you watch from beginning, u understand that it will not end on a happy note for everyone. Many were lost during this quest of last standing heroes to bring back those who dusted away. But the sacrifice of Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow was a punch in the face that Avengers are true to their word - they are ready to die to bring back their friends. And the nail in the coffin was death of Tony Stark aka IronMan, who eradicated Universe of Thanos before dying. His death closed a chapter of many people's life.
There were great moments like Captain America finally lifting and using Thanos.
All in all superhero genre won't be same without these people who defined an era of ""Superheroes"".",positive
"Avengers endgame in my opinion is probably the best mcu film to come out. And I'm talking infinity war levels. It may have surpass it by a mile. This movie was just full of surprises, I don't want to spoil it to much, but this was probably the saddest mcu movie to be released. Like tears just running down my face. Of course Anthony and Joe Russo are back at it again with making an amazing movie. There was one line in particular that made me cry I don't want to say it but once you hear it. You will cry too. And something symbolic in there too. But overall this movie was freaking amazing. Sense I can't give it a 9.5. I give it a 9",positive
If you take all marvel movie so serious you will understand that every single scenes from the previous marvel movies were the step towards the end....Especialy the dream of Tony Stark from Age of Ultron is comes true...you can imagine what will be Tony supposed to do....,positive
Though I have some issues with the way the last few years went with the Marvel universe (like the moronic identity political game they try to sell to us) this one was different while it is still there its easily looked over by the pure emotional build up that has been going for 11 years. I stand here saying that when I first saw iron man in theaters I could have never dreamt of such a thrill ride like this and with a near perfect ending.,positive
"Every single marvel movie serves as a stepping stone to this very movie. This movie is complete on every aspect from the beginning to the end. Every Avenger plays a significant role that tells their story to the full. Filled with action, emotion, comedy and a great storyline, this movie will blow everyone away in 2019 and beyond.Thanks to Marvel and the Russo Brothers for making a movie that will make history in my personal books.",positive
"I usually dont cry when its about movies, but when ironman died i kinda cried. Im so brocken now. I dont know what to write but yeah. I listen to twin size mattress (good song)",positive
"I didn't hate this the same as the Transformer franchise, or reboot of Star wars. Unfortunately they all are cookie cutter films, look, taste, feel the same, nothing really sets it apart. My 2 biggest issues with this film were did it really need to be 2 3/4 hrs long. I figure with a good film editor they could have clipped 25 min and not ruin the pacing, the second is Bree Larson. I just find her unlikable. Downey, Hemsworth great as always. Would love to see Hemsworth, take on the 007 role once Craig retires. Last cameo for Stan Lee.Endgame isn't a bad film, just nothing really special about it either. I can find more fulfilling ways to spend 2 3/4 hrs.",positive
"I can't add much here that the other 9,000 people who have reviewed it haven't covered. Just a funny observation I've had upon repeat viewings.It's funny how prescient the scene with the Russo brother giving in therapy is, for fans of this movie. You know, the one where he's talking with Steve Rogers about his date?
""He started to cry as they were bringing out the salads.""
""What about you?""
""I... cried as they were bringing out dessert.""This is pretty much how EVERY... SINGLE... CONVERSATION about this movie goes with people I know.""He cried when the CGI raccoon held the blue lady's hand.""
""What about you?""
""I... cried when a hammer deemed a fat man still worthy.""That a movie could make be lose track of how many times I got misty eyed or downright weepy, BEFORE the final half hour where it was non-stop tears of all varieties (joy, sorrow, grief, sheer admiration of your childhood being put on an IMAX screen in full glory, etc, etc)... that really speaks to how emotionally impactful and Incredible such a film is. EVERYBODY I talk with had at least one scene that made them cry; how often does a movie do that with any audience, much less one as diverse as this one had?",positive
"This is a very weak film that has both good sides and bad sides, a good side is only in the picture and in the humor, everything else is bad, the plot is weak and we repeat ourselves, there are many plot holes, the laws of the universe are violated, sometimes the graphics look very cheap, if the war of infinity is a masterpiece then the endgame is a fan service !!! So bad final(((",positive
It's rewind time everybody! I hate this movie. Go away.,negative
"Wow.
Phew.It is hard to put in words the emotions I went through after watching this epic.
The 10 years journey with this cinematic universe comes to an end and how. Avengers: Endgame is that final piece of the puzzle which MARVEL puts it out in style. The movie is a treat in every possible way for the loyal fans and also for the 'hype' crowd. The action, the humour, emotions and the characterization are blended in so well. The story is an epic journey with some great nostalgic elements thrown in. The fans who have followed the universe are going to relate and love every bit of it.This movie does not need a review, it does not need a brief overview. Even if I try, I cannot possibly write about the characters and how good everyone were. This is a movie to be experienced in the cinemas. So go out there watch this movie of a lifetime.And as Thanos says ""Now I rest"".PS: Please be good and don't spoil this for others.",positive
"I must next watched a different film to many on here but let's be honest this is the kind of film that attracts a lot of fanboys and /or rivals/trolls.My opinion is not biased as I love and watch all superhero films ever since the original superman.I just felt infinity war was a much better film that didn't mess around, we got into it straight away and the ending was unlike anything I've seen before in a comic based movie. Endgame didn't deliver on many fronts, things like captain marvel playing a big part felt like I was cheated or the whole plan by Dr strange was never fully explained. There were way too many jokes even for a marvel film and one of the strongest characters Thor was the butt of all jokes thought of the film till maybe the last 5 minutes during the big fight.I think the movie reminded me of how I felt after watching matrix revolution... Just didn't live up to the hype sadly.",positive
"Before I start this review I MUST address the immense pressure put on this movie. Perhaps no other movie in the history of cinema has had as much hype and expectations surrounding it as Avengers Endgame. It was the finale to one of the longest and most successful blockbuster film franchises in history, as well as the followup to one of the best blockbuster films of the last century. The last 10 YEARS of Marvel movies ALL built to this ONE movie! If it failed, that would be ALL that people would remember. They would not remember the exceptional Captain America Civil War, or Black Panther, or The Avengers (2012), or Avengers Infinity War, or the ENTIRE rest of the Infinity Saga! They would ONLY remember that THIS MOVIE FAILED! All the time, effort, and vast amounts of money put into the last decade of Marvel Studios films would have essentially been wasted! Normally you could NEVER expect a movie with this much build up around it to live up to expectations! Hype has been ruining movies for decades and NO movie has ever had more hype around it then this! And yet, not only did Endgame live up to expectations, it SURPASSED them in the minds of millions of fans (including myself). Instead of being weighed down by the hype, the movie used it to its advantage, brilliantly subverting and satisfying expectations! Very few other films in the history of cinema have EVER succeeded in this way at THIS magnitude! The accomplishments of this film MUST be respected. However, all of this is still only a small part as to why this film is so special. Endgame is a poignant example for how to make a genuinely masterful movie in a big blockbuster setting.The acting performances in this film are absolutely sublime! Never before have all powerful superheroes felt SO human. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlet Johannson, Josh Brolin, and Karen Gillan all give some of the best performances of their entire careers in this film!The writing of the film is brilliant, as all the characters deal with the astronomical grief of their failure in the last movie in vastly different ways. Some grow angry and resentful over it. Some attempt to forget about it and make a new life for themselves. Others become depressed, hollow shells of their former selves. And still others manage to cling to their humanity and continue helping people as best as they can. But no matter how they choose to deal with it, none of them are as they once were. They are no longer the confident, brave, and powerful warriors that they were in the previous films. Now they are lonely, jaded, and riddled with sadness. I have heard many people criticize this film for being too slow in the first too acts. What these people don't undertstand is that the movie HAS to be slow. The film must drive home just how enormous the consequences of the Avengers' failure are, and the only way for it to do that is to slow down and take it's time showing the incomprehensible amount of damage that their failure has caused.However, the one thing about the characters that has not changed is their selflessness. This is what the film explores so well and what makes it so inspiring. Despite all that has happened and all that has gone horribly wrong, the characters all still manage to retain the one trait that makes them heroes. They all still have a desire to do the right thing and save the world. For some of the heroes this desire has been buried deep inside them by all the grief they now bear. This makes it incredibly satisfying to see the desire slowly begin to surface in them again, as the hope for victory grows.The endings for each of the Avengers' stories are also all handled with remarkable care. The ending's for each of the Avenger's character arcs all feel like they make sense and that they are earned. This is once again a testement to the film's writing. The film recognizes what each of the characters care about, and one by one, it gives them each closure to their worries and a fitting end to their suffering that makes sense for each character. Not to spoil anything, but some of these endings are incredibly heartbreaking and will emotionally effect the audience in ways that few films could ever hope to achieve.The action in this film is honest to god some of the best I have EVER seen. Even when the action scenes contain dozens upon dozens of characters fighting at once they are still, somehow, choreographed exceptionally well. You would be heart pressed to find ANY mistakes in the editing and choreography of ANY of Endgame's fight scenes. The action is also further enhanced to GODLY levels by the stellar visual effects and music. The visual effects team for the Avengers movies always does a phenomenal job conveying the large than life scale of the battles and this is no exception. Some of the scenes in this film look so good that they can only be described as movie magic. The musical score of this film is, in my opinion, the most breathaking soundtrack in blockbuster film history. Yes, this even includes Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings, and Harry Potter. The music gives a massive adrenaline boost to any scene that it is heard in and undoubtedly puts composer Alan Silvestri on par with some of the greatest film composers of all time, such as John Williams and Hans Zimmer.The movie is also unbelievably well paced for it's length. It is a 3 hour movie that feels like two. This is due to the fact that almost every scene in the film feels like it needs to be there in order to contribute to the story. Few films that are this long are this entertaining and the ones that are, will usually be considered some of the best films of their genres, such as Saving Private Ryan and Lord Of The Rings The Return Of The King.Overall, Avengers Endgame more than delivers on all fronts and is one of the most moving, inspirational, and powerful movies I have ever seen. The immersive storytelling, smart writing, impeccable acting, stunning action, and beautiful music make this a must see for any fan. In my opinion, Endgame will undoubtedly go down as a timeless classic of the superhero genre, and one of the greatest film franchise finales of all time.",positive
The fact that some people disliked this movie honestly baffles me. This movie beyond exceeded my expectations. It was a perfect mix of humor within sadness. Throughout the movie I would constantly get goosebumps from the sheer epicness of the moment. Truly a perfect ending to an era. I applaud the directors.,positive
The title says it all........... A Fitting End to an Amazing Saga. Excelsior!!!!,positive
"Endgame was an eagerly anticipated event (it is an *event*) in my household: family members who saw it before others were assiduous in not revealing spoilers, such was the reverence for the film and not wanting to spoil it for others. Having seen it, I can now understand why.I'm so old I remember reading the original Avengers comics, and one of the most satisfying things about Endgame was the fidelity, once again, to the spirit of the original comics and their characters, scripted by Lee and drawn by Kirby or Ditko. This is always a huge relief to a Marvel fan. Evans and Downey can be justifiably proud of the way they incarnated their characters, fleshing out in a very real and human way, the 2-dimensional comic. In fact it is a great effort by the whole cast: there is not one weak performance.It's one of the best-crafted films I've ever seen: this statement gives you a clue that it is not the crash-bang, thrill-a-minute extravaganza that we've come to expect from the genre. There are many poignant and tender scenes early on as the dreadful realization of Thanos's actions in Infinity War become apparent. The plot lines are clever, not contrived; with the trademark humour intact, as the action builds to one climax after another. I was looking out for the woke scenes and sure enough, they do come, but are immediately followed and tempered by a thrilling affirmation of the triumph and tragedy of the life of the Hero. What more can you ask for?A truly momentous film. Great, even.",positive
"Thor is spoiled in this movie.captain America is playing with Thor's hammer is likely very funny.
Thanos performance is very powerful.storyline is also average.....when you going to theatre not excepted very much.",positive
"GENERAL CONSENSUS (BAD, OK, GOOD, EXCELLENT): Excellent film and very good ending to the Tony Stark Marvel Era Saga.",positive
"Biggest issue with any avengers movie: tone. Trying to go from scene to scene in such quick succession, changing characters, emotions, setting, gives me whiplash. Though I don't think a marvel movie needed to explain time travel, it sets rules and breaks them (although most time travel movies do this to some degree. The only egregious example of Endgame doing it is at the end of the movie, when Steve Rogers doesn't come back from the past.)My largest gripe was that they made infinity war 2. There was no way to top infinity war, that massive battle scene could never be measured up to. So they found a way to use time travel and do it again.Not to mention, fat, depressed, alcoholic Thor played for laughs. No idea why they thought fat depressed alcoholic was a good running gag.I didn't hate it. It was okay. If I turn off my brain it's a fun movie to watch, and I totally get why people like it. I don't have anything against marvel movies either, I really enjoyed infinity war and give it a solid 8/10. I just saw quite a few issues with this one.",positive
I'm sorry but this movie was boring except for the last part. Infinity war was well balanced and every character had a role. Also had action from beginning to end. But endgame mostly had unnecessary talks or travelling here and there. Most main characters don't even have any fight scenes. Whole movie is focused on only 2-3 characters. Rest of the characters were in it like they just have a cameo. Should have made a semi team up film after infinity war and then Endgame with all the characters having enough screentime. Wasted opportunity.,negative
"At first I was a little skeptical about how they were going to put this movie together after the way Infinity War ended. After Thanos snapped his fingers at the end of Infinity War it kind of left everyone with there jaws dropped and tears in there eyes, at least that's how my reaction was. I thought it was interesting how the first half of the movie was about how all the heroes that survived Infinity War were copping with life after the snap how they planned on living life and surviving. I loved how they brought each individuals story line together to everyone ultimately working together in making a plan to bring the lost heroes back and bring Thanos and all his minions down. In the end I was very surprised with what went down and I guess you could say there was a lot of mixed emotions. emotions ranged from very happy to pretty dam sad after all said and done. I feel like more things could have been explained better and maybe a little more suspense in this movie which is why I gave it a 9 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of 10 but this was an amazing movie. Ultimately I love Marvel and what they did throughout the years to make everything lead up to this movie and ending to a great saga.",positive
"A movie like this shouldn't be able to exist. A 3 hour long movie that gives a conclusion to a universe that has been building up for 11 years. A movie that seamlessly blends the directorial visions of all the directors of past films and the tones present in those films. A movie whose first act let's you see the hopelessness that the hero's we have seen for the past 10 years. But, is able to put the emotional stake and realize they actually lost. A movie that is able to be a action adventure comedy and a second act that is a fantastic heist movie. A movie that is able to make time travel make sense. The second act is fantastic a cross between 3 teams that pull off a superhero oceans 11 heist and it works perfectly. Then the final act come to the climactic end that we all wanted. When Captain America has a broken shield in one hand and then mjolnir and says ""avengers assemble"" absolutely the best way to give comic book fans the ending battle they deserve.

"For me, Avengers: Endgame is honestly the greatest, most thrilling and epic film of the MCU, the battle scenes and performances shown were never done before in Marvel cinematic history and they will leave you with so much surprises!11 years in the making and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It exceeded everyone's expectations and even the comic book nerd ones!Go see it while you can because you will NEVER ever experience something like this in a movie theatre this breath-taking and shocking.It also had such an amazing and satisfying wrap-ups to the major characters of the MCU. Couldn't ask for a better movie and a better way to end this hell-of-a journey.",positive
"Honestly, no MCU movie has got me so emotionally involved in it's story and Endgame does just that. Not only do I get my CGI epic fight scene fix, I also felt closure with the first 6 avengers this is truly a masterpiece and a Must Watch for any movie buff, casual and child.",positive
"Shooting quality, actors, plot, graphics, locations, costumes of heroes
disadvantages:
So many questions and so few answers))
Good day to all, friends!I, as a person who at one time was very fond of comics about super heroes, could not pass by this film. In general, I have been watching Marvel for a long time, I also watched individual films about each hero. The plot of the film is quite interesting and unusual, there is a gradual tie at a good pace.I know most of the actors in this film, but precisely because of the roles of super heroes. The actors are good, they do an excellent job with their role, they get used to it well. As far as I know, for the sake of such roles, actors have to train a lot and hard, as well as monitor their nutrition, and it's worth a lot. I would like to mention the special effects of the film, they are simply gorgeous. Someone can give a minus to the film for the fact that there are a lot of computer graphics. Yes, it really is, but it's all so qualitatively implemented that I, on the contrary, consider it a feature of the film.As a person who has always been interested in such a topic as people with superpowers, what superpowers can be, etc., it was quite interesting to see this realization in the cinema.As a result, I am completely satisfied with the film, I watched it like 3 times. Most of all, of course, the film is popular with young people, but adults sometimes like to watch such films. So I boldly recommend the film and wish you a pleasant viewing!",positive
"This is the culmination to end all culminations. Just superbly well done and is such a well balanced blend of action, laughs, cries and sensational acting and film making. Stretching the CGI prowess of our time to the limits and concluding a brilliant series of films. I really hope the next series of films do these justice. Without RDJ they will be missing a major part of the exceptional element to these films but hopefully with the talent available a new type of RDJ will appear. I think I'll leave it a few months and then start rewatching them again.",positive
"Practically nothing happens in the first 90 minutes, then it eventually speeds up. Usual overly long battle scenes, sone sad moments and enough laughs to keep you interested. Can see more spin offs coming at some stage to keep the money rolling in.",positive
"A worthy follow-up to Infinity War with a lot of action, humour and drama. Couple of plot contrivances, but you can easily overlook them.",positive
"This movie was all over the place. And the writing was simply lazy.Time travel? smhIn most cases, time travel is a refuge for lazy fantasy/sci-fi writers. How do we solve this problem we got our heroes into? Time travel. LAZYAND, Captain Marvel saves Tony Stark and Blue Girl at the last minute? LAZYI won't even get into the fight scenes. Okay. Just a little. There were some clever gems. But in general, there weren't enough of them.I liken this Endgame to a Disney Star Wars Movie. That being said, Infinity War blew doors. I could watch that any day of the week.",positive
Listen I'll take X-Men over the avengers any day. boring characters,negative
Ending of the Avenger with awesomeness but I feel little slow than other Avenger because of too emotional scenes.,positive
This film was so much fun & love how Thanos was finally defeated once & for all.,positive
"Right, this film is excellent. I would say I preferred Infinity War, as it was right in your face from the beginning.
Now Endgame, has a lot of build up. So all that rubbish about not being able to go for a pee, in fear of missing something. Do so in the first two hours.Watch out for the peanut butter sandwich.",positive
I don't know what it is about this film but it's just amazing.,positive
"So for the longest time my two favourite movies were Empire Strikes Back and Jurassic Park......Well times change because its now Empire Strikes Back and Avengers Endgame.This movie was perfect that's all I can say there is absolutely no flaws a perfect way to end an era of MCU..10/10 a flawless movie and now my second favourite movie of all time..... Perfect.
#MCU #avengersendgame",positive
"9/10 - an impressive cast list, an enthralling storyline, and an epic end to an era enables this superhero flick to stand out among the increasing monotony of the genre",positive
"The movie is fun, but the writing leaves a lot to be desired. I was blown away by Infinity War, but this movie was a lot less impressive. The story was over stuffed, some of the plot points didn't make sense, and over all the movie seemed more concerned with shoving in humor and callbacks than with telling a well crafted story. It's enjoyable, but definitely not on par with some of the other entries in the MCU.",positive
"Satisfying 3-hours in which you go through a lot of emotions. And the best feeling is when you sit in a theater with NO empty seats, and everyone goes through the same thing like you do. We all clap when there's a satisfying scene that explains or goes well with all the references in the past. We all laugh out loud at MCU's clever and silly jokes. And we all cry when there's a sad thing happening (don't want to spoil you so that's all I can say).I guess that's all you need to know to understand that it's worth it to see the movie, and definitely more worth it to see it with other fellow MCU fans. It's been 12 hours and I'm still not over the movie yet, keep talking about it. Thank you Marvel for a successful movie series. Thank you for giving us years of awesomeness. You have made and ended the journey with extraordinary storytelling. Thank you!!",positive
"This movie is for fans of the MCU.Casual fans will more than likely prefer Infinity War over Endgame, however for fans (hardcore) of the MCU, this is everything you could want and more.Going into the movie I kept asking myself, will Iron Man die, or Cap? Maybe both? Who will wield the gauntlet? And I couldn't have been happier with the result of those questions. But starting from the beginning having Thanos be decapitated and then having sort of a ""where are they now"" sequence was great. It almost made Infinity War feel like the end, and then Endgame was a new beginning. Iron Man being rewarded from the snap in the long run was also fascinating. The first hour was a slow burn, and that's why I feel like this movie is not for the casual viewer. Personally being a huge MCU fan, this character development, is beautiful. Seeing how our characters have reacted five years later was so interesting, and in many ways, it shows us as an audience who these people could be, in many ways negative (Thor, Hawkeye), and many ways positive. (Iron Man, Hulk, Cap.) Also seeing some Avengers still trying to do super hero stuff, but not having much to do, brings a thought, was the snap a good thing?Now the time travel was executed, but of course no matter how you swing it, time travel will create problems. It was done as well as it could have been, and luckily they didn't undo any events, they just brought everyone back. That works on many levels, Infinity War keeps the stakes that it had, and the revived characters remember the events. This could be a fun idea to play with, in future MCU films. Obviously all of the call backs were fun, and the time travel rules mean that they created new realities. So no, if you watch the first Avengers movie, Iron Man, Cap, Hulk, and Ant Man aren't running around in the background. Well executed.The final fight was unlike anything I could have predicted. Cap using Mjornir, Thor becoming bad ass again, Thanos kicking ass, Iron Man, Hawkeye, the list goes on. And then every character ever shows up and it becomes a comic book fans dream.Let's talk about each original six members arch.Black Widow- what a shock having her die. Not giving her a proper funeral was very annoying, but with so much happening its forgivable. At the beginning of this movie, you can feel her urgency, she is in her element, and only wants to do good. Having her lead the remaining Avengers five years later, because that is all she knows at this point, really works. She is having a very tough time accepting the world for what it is, so when she knows she can save it by giving her life, she has it no other way. This is perfect for her character, and it is satisfying that her ""red"" is gone.Hulk- I really liked Proffesor Hulk, especially that he was kind of douchey, it worked. This movie wraps up Bruce's 3 movie arch starting with Ragnarok, and it was great, because he helps Thor like, like Thor helped him. He gets to have a good moment putting on the nano gauntlet, and the scene with The Ancient One was perfect Bruce Banner. I do believe that should be it for his character.Hawkeye- The opening scene of this movie set the tone for this bad ass. So sad. However, having him be a big part of the climax was great, he would do anything just to see his family again. And his character having to watch his best friend die, goes in to his tragedy even more. Loss after loss. He deserved a happy ending just as much as anybody.Thor- I liked drunk Thor. The comedy at this point is what the character is. But the amount of tragedy Thor went through, it makes sense he would hit fuck it mode. Being able to see him with his mother, and her saying ""everyone fails when they try to be who they're supposed to be, you succeed when you be who you want to be."" (Something like that.) Very well done. Thor is at the end of the day, a bad ass.Iron Man- Everything starts with ""I am Iron Man"" and it ends that way. His destiny was the keep the world safe, and he does that. The amount that he put on the line, time and time again, he is now able to finally rest. One of the most powerful death scenes, ever. Robert Downey Jr's performance was incredible. And the call backs for him were great. The fact that his life was great after the snap, but he still had to try and fix it, proves that he is meant to be Iron Man. The scene with his dad was fantastic as well.Captain America- The MVP. Honestly this was Cap's finest hour. A man out of time gets time back. Throughout his run in the MCU he had accepted his life as a soldier. But that changed here, and he was able to have his last dance. My theory on old Cap is he didn't change the timeline when he went back, he just stayed incognito. That's why he was able to be there to pass the shield, without creating a new timeline.Overall it's close to perfect. You can find issues in the plot because of the time travel. But fuck that, this was a love letter, and for MCU fans, a perfect ending.",positive
"I watched this movie for a second time and didn't realize before half way through that I already had seen it.
I grew up reading comics and I enjoy good movies based on such - but this is not a good movie.
Iron man, Guardians and Ant man - all have great movies and the start of Avengers also brought something exciting.
Endgame is boring, lacks imagination and feels like a neverending wait for it to end. The main problem is that they try to make it epic and over the top righteous - and succeed cutting all emotional ties to the audience.
See it so you can talk of it, but prepare to fast forward, fall asleep or a me - forget that you have seen it.",negative
"It builds from a haunting melancholy tune to a thundering, iron-willed anthem for everything that's great about MCU and comic books in general. Twists, turns, surprises, tears, smiles and memories.. as close to a perfect conclusion to ""Infinity War"" one could hope!",positive
Great film and brings the series a a fitting and satisfying conclusion. A must see,positive
"The moment Tony left was also the moment to say goodbye to the series. Even if there is a lot of reluctance, the heart still hopes that those superheroes are as real as their original hearts. Dreams are not fairy tales, but they can soothe the hearts that are often lost in reality. Dreams are hope, simple beauty, and the driving force behind our love of the world. Thank you, Stan Lee, thank you Marvel for this decade, thank you for accompanying me in the Marvel universe, thank you.",positive
"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has always been stuck with certain limitations, such as a formulaic three act structure, not exceeding a pg13 rating and such. However this film, being a form of climax to the saga, offers something its audience hasn't really experience, at least from Marvel. This film is more narratively complex and interesting than all its predecessors. While watching you were quite surprised as to where are characters would end up next, this kept the picture thrilling and exciting throughout. The Russo Brothers have always bent the limitations to their will by keeping a good sense of what they're actually capable of doing. These limitations are annoying cause you really are not gonna get much of a different film to the last one or the next. But limitation breeds creativity. The Russo's have completely taken advantage of that and it shows in their films in the Mcu and especially here in Avengers EndgameObviously the writers had a say in what was actually happening and they did an amazing job at balancing the characters on their journey in this film. There were various plots with various characters that needed to have interesting chemistry or connections with one another, whichever worked best for the characters. It shows how carefully they understand the characters and care for how their stories will end or where they will go, and I appreciate that a lot personally. They also took many a risk with how the character interact with the tragedies and conflicts that have faced them, most notably Iron Man, Thor and Hawkeye. Each of those characters went through tremendous change and each ended up somewhere entirely different which is truly fascinating and entirely believable. Certain bits play for broken characters that you genuinely feel terrible for and other bits play for comedy and the blance is fairly consistent. I really like how this film is very messy and chaotic but the Writers and Directors guide us through it all, it's impressive.It is entirely visually stimulating across the board, the cgi is some of the best ever and very carefull done, the characters have interesting looks that change often. It's shot nicely, that hendheld look they've had in the Russos films is present and plays for certain emotional thing, for example the opening scene. There was a certain shot just after the opening titles which, with context, makes you feel really uneasy. When it comes to the ending you really feel a sense of heroism and hope from an otherwise hopeless world and certain things happen that shock and aw and they come at just the right moment. It really delivers on a satisfying climactic battle. The character remains alive in everyone throughout the climax and makes you build up excitement and care for how this could end. It's drastically enjoyable and emotional. The finality for many of the characters, when things wrap up, completely delivers. Where the last film (Infinity War) left you with a bad taste in your mouth, this one does something different entirely and allows certain characters to progress and to end. I really enjoyed this film throughout and the build up made it all worth while. Although personally I've been frustrated and unsatisfied with most of the Mcu movies I'm overly happy with this one and any of the Russo Brothers films.",positive
"What I like most is the foothold of the whole story: there are no longer long sermons about heroes and responsibilities, but some just want to recover lost things and love in the long river of time. After all, the most moving story is not saving the world, but the meeting and parting between people",positive
"I'd say the perfect end for this series even if the ending is a little hard to take.
There is a ton of action - well made CGI - not too many mistakes in logic and heartbreaking moments.I'll miss it waiting for a continue.If you don't see it the movie in cinema you'll not get the whole beauty of it.",positive
"I have been a Marvel Fan since my childhood. It all started with Iron-Man and then flourished by the other movies in MCU! I watched each and every film to date. For a MCU admirer like me ; this film was disappointing to say the least. When infinity war ended, I was literally teared up by the experience I got. It boosted the hype, the anticipation to a new level! I was counting on the finale film to be the best I have ever seen in the MCU so far. But that dream, that wish of mine got shattered! Why? There are so many reasons behind it! Slow pace till the time travel sequences kicked up, lack of cohesiveness between the characters, not duly written script, lesser emotional impact ; all of these made the film less enjoyable for me. The only thing that saved it from being doomed for me is the Last 1 hour, the climax battle scenes are beautifully made. To have all the superheroes in one place and give proper screen times to everyone is a daunting task. They handled it pretty well! The performances especially from RDJ was memorable and touching at the same moment. Overall a decent film for my liking and for my expectancy that I had after The last film. It Should have been way way better. All of the True Marvel fans deserved it.",positive
Honestly the best movie and cinematic experience ever. This is a perfect send off and anyone scoring it less than 10 is just trying to be controversial.,positive
"Never has so much been spent on glorious VFX to service an orgy of Deus Ex Machina in order to fulfill the standard juvenile Hollywood ending that the good guys always win. Such a pure, white bread, immature ending, I'm embarrassed for Marvel that so much effort went into an ending dumbed down for pre-teens. What's the point of all this comic-book-to-big-screen-madness if there's no doubt of the outcome?! I suppose they TRY to make it look difficult for the heroes but then you throw in never-done-before quantum-based time-travel and voila, good guys prevail. Such a colossal waste of story-telling, of sci-fi adventure. My soul weeps.",positive
"And i did like the previous ones. The first part was also not so good but this one was empty .... i totally don't understand why many people did like it. The aspects i usually like in this series is the humor and fun. This one didn't have almost any jokes and the storyline, is (as usual) pretty idiotic. There was not even any sophistication in the plot, just ... three hours of nothing. i don't rate it with 1/10 just because there were a few well done landscape shots...Come on, earth, stop spinning... i want to get off...",negative
That's what I call ideal ending. It was really interesting to watch this film from first to the last minute. Film is over 3 hour long however it wasn't too long for me. Yeah Iron Man died. Which was brave from his still I'm not a fan of Iron Man so it was Okay from me. Plot was almost a masterpiece just one detail was really hideous. Why Avengers waited for 5 years to kill Thanos it's just a little bit nonsense. However movie was amazing 9/10. Worth all the awards.,positive
It's was one of my best Experiences ever. It's a memory that I will share with my childrens & Grandchildrens,positive
"Very good movie. Kind of goofie with the time travel stuff. The cringe worthy segments I had heard about were not that bad, and Captain Marvel did not ruin the movie as feared. Will be seeing this one again.",positive
"Avengers endgame has been the greatest MCU movie since 2008. This movie is filled with sad and comedy scenes the plot is just great. Really worth it
And don't let anyone spoil you the movie.",positive
Really nice film.I suggest to see this film after watching the previous movie of the mcu. It's a great film anyway but without the other movies you can't fully understand the story.It's full of action scenes and the special effect are crazy.,positive
"I thought I would be in for a disappointment, but luckily was not let down. Everything about this is solid. (I did not like Avengers: Age of Ultron) This I liked. There is one scene which I did not understand - perhaps someone could help me?? The remaining Avengers must travel back in time, to collect the Infinity Stones before Thanos can get his hands on them. So they go to the headquarters where Loki is being held, but they make a mistake, and they drop the case one of them is in, and Loki grabs it, then disappears?? We never see him for the rest of the movie??? Maybe it was just me, or there is something there that I missed. Either way, it is a solid film, but keep in mind, it is a time travel film, mostly. There is very little action other than the ending. A few of your favorite characters (might be / are) lost, for good now.... They keep the recapping to a minimum, which is another thing they did right. It feels not like a rehash, but maintains its own feel, unlike sooo many time travel films which do it wrong! The story flows perfectly, unlike Age of Ultron which I disliked. This has more of a character-centered feel to it. I still say that Infinity War was better, but this has its own charms in its own right.",positive
"Honestly... Time travel. It just feels lazy, and it leaves a lot of holes and questions. I'm not like a die hard mcu fan, but I've seen almost all of the movies leading up to this one (I think antman and wasp and captain marvel are the only ones I skipped) and I felt like this was mostly a letdown, but if I had been anticipating this movie as much as I know millions of people have been, I probably would have felt almost insulted.
They spend way too much time setting up the counter attack, and then the big plan is... Wait for it... We'll just go back in time and stop it before it starts! Not exactly original, or even creative... As I said before, it seems really lazy. Not to mention the myriad of questions your left with due to the paradox of time travel... For instance... If they retrieve all the stones before Thanos gets them, then how is everyone still missing when they get back to the present? If Thanos never gets the stones, then there's no snap, therefore no one is missing, vision never dies etc... It's just lazy writing for a fan base that has handed billions of dollars to Marvel for these movies.
What did I like? Not that anyone cares, but I am a Captain America fan... So the scene with Cap wielding Mjolnir was awesome! In fact that whole scene with Thanos vs. Cap, Thor, and Stark was by far the best scene in the entire mcu catalog IMO. I could have watched that for a lot longer.
Beyond that... Thor as a bum was silly, but also funny. Stark was incredible. The Hulk was underwhelming. Hawkeye and widow were okay.
I know a lot of other people were upset about the lack of screen time for all the other characters, but I'll forgive this point, because it is an AVENGERS movie... And the original 6 avengers were the being highlighted, which is completely understandable. Although ant man, rocket, Warhammer, and nebula also had significant roles, but again... I didn't really mind the attention paid to the core 6 players. (then again, I am a Cap fan, so maybe that had something to do with it).
Also, why even have a Captain Marvel movie release right before endgame, then introduce her in the movie, just to have her absent for 95% of the movie?
And how was Thanos so strong without the stones? Seems to me he almost didn't even need them with the way he was destroying everyone without them. Thor nearly kills him with the stones, but in this movie Thanos can pound Thor with Mjolnir and stormbreaker, plus Cap and Iron man... Cmon... It's little things like that, that are just annoying.
Overall it was meh, with one outstanding scene.",positive
"This movie was just beautiful, ten years of movies and this one is the best, not a very emotional person when it comes to movies, I rarely cry, and I did, more than once actually. It was just amazing, everything, vfx, soundtrack, marvel, what a ride, everything I espected and more, it deserves everything it has everything.
It deserves to be between the best, because it is one of the best.
Just marvelous. It's perfect, just love it!
Thank you Marvel, thank you to everyone who made this movie, cast, director´s, producer, just every single one of then.
What a ride!!!

"There are no spoilers needed to back up the statement that 'Endgame' is the Swiss cheese of the bunch as far as plot holes and internal contradictions are concerned. Emotionally strong and visually impressive, it's one of the most entertaining movies in the MCU and cannot be missed by anyone who watched most of the others.But unless you are already deeply invested in the MCU or simply have to know ""what's next"" after the (actually far better) 'Inifity War', or you're just here for the fights, tear jerks and explosions, this movie is entirely missable. You will be passing up the opportunity to endlessly pick it apart with your geek friends though, who will spend the next decade trying to come up with excuses to make this movie work.It *is* after all the culmination of a decade of storytelling and it deserves credit for pulling that off. It's a shame that a movie that does such a good job of connecting everything, making it look so good, with so much star power, ends up being a plot mess and honestly lazy.",positive
"For me this movie was like one of those meals where you were really enjoying it at the time, but then you ate too much and began to feel queasy and bloated, and later regretted having eaten so much and vow never to eat so much again.All the usual stylistic ingredients are present and skillfully executed, but by the end it is apparent that bad decisions have made which have undermined the very fabric of the MCU you previously knew and loved.Tony Stark - ""I just need you to know my priorities. Bring back everyone we lost, hopefully. Keep what I found, definitely...""Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely decided that Tony Stark's death was inevitable... as a ""(move) to selflessness"". They felt that his death was earned after granting him ""the perfect retirement life,"" adding, ""That's the life he's been striving for... They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.""Really? Maybe ask his daughter how she feels about that when she grows up, not to mention everyone else, who were condemned to endure the 5 years of suffering and loss, and then live with the trauma of those experiences forever after, all so that one person, Tony Stark, can preserve his child and the happy times he had with Pepper.Tony's feelings are very human, but not very heroic. On a personal level the trade off looks fine, Stark allowed to keep his 5 years of happy memories before risking his life to restore the Universe. However, looking at the bigger picture, it becomes monumentally ""selfish"" rather than ""selfless"".Steve Rogers - ""I thought, after everything that's happened -- maybe I should try out some of that life Tony always told me to get.""Sam Wilson - ""Only thing bumming me out is now I live in a world without Captain America.""Exactly, Captain America trades in his life as a hero for that of an ordinary person, and all those good deeds he did and all the people he saved as a hero in that version of his life are therefore not saved and all those villains he foiled are allowed to have their evil way and America is probably being run by Hydra.Again a very human desire but not a very heroic outcome when you examine the big picture and the type of person Steve Rogers was designed to be just would not do that. Even mixed up teenager Peter Parker knows that ""with great power there must also come great responsibility"" so there is no way Cap would abandon his. I'm not against characters developing and learning for their experiences and the situations they encounter during the telling of their story, but in the end they need to remain true to the essence of what their character represents.Of course we know there are 14,000,605 plus alternative futures, or multiverses, or whatever, which may contain happy Tony Starks and Steve Rogers', but in that case, why bother to try and change this particular one? But lets not go down the time travel rabbit hole just yetSmart Hulk - ""Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds.""Or the worst of all possible Worlds?Hulk without his raw overpowering emotion is no longer the HulkUltimately what is the point of difference for a Hulk who is fully in control of himself?Thor - It's time to be who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be.""Any Thor who has doubts about who he is and his place in the World is just not Thor. His arrogance has been the well spring of the humour in his stories and was the reason he was sent to Earth in the first place. Thor, if not literally a ""God"", is a member of a royal family that leads a race of super-powerful beings. Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar or Napoleon did not abandon their destiny and neither would Thor, because that is the type of hero he was designed to be.And finally we come to the rabbit hole that is time travel. Specifically time travel as the last refuge of failed writing, or the easy way out for lazy writing. When the authors have painted themselves into a corner from which there is not sensible way out.Unless the story is specifically centered around exploring the concept and implications of time travel, or is a comedy, I believe it is a subject that should be avoided, because it is too complex for anyone with a brain smaller than Stephen Hawking to cope with reconciling the ramifications (which includes 99.9% of all movie script writers). All the paradoxical problems that arise as a result of it can easily pull the rug out from under not only the current movie but those that went before.And so here we are with a selfish Tony Stark who deliberately condemned everyone in the Universe to 5 years of torture as the price for his own personal piece of mind, a Captain America who abandons everything he ever stood for, a Hulk who no longer the Hulk (instead a big green Ben Grimm with Reed Richards brains) and a Thor who doesn't really know who he is...Inferius!",negative

"That was the greatest ending that was made for that world which started 11 years ago by making it so great and powerfulAfter losing by Thanos in Infinity war the whole team is starting to get them selfes ready by getting Captain Marvel to their team to defeat him and get every body disappeared again so what will they do ?
Every body wanted to know what was going to happen after the ending of infity war
Actually they made it great really great with powerful story that got every small and big thing from marvel universe with 3 hours ! That's unbelievable to get to know it ,it got every character that created the universe by a great way to end the game by it's suitable wayBy the performances everybody did a great job that did what they supposed to do in every scene was created I can say that the best acting in the movie was done by Robert Downy Jr
The Visual effects were great with no any negative point in it,the sound system was good and I felt it in the theater,every simple thing that was supposed to be good was there and thanks to the Russos for getting every thing really greatThe movie you should see it go see it as hard as you can if you're a great fan to marvel and if your not you can also go and believe me you're gonna see every thing can be made in any movie there gonna be action,comedy, great scenario I hope he get a chance by nominating it in the adapted screenplay next Oscars as Logan did,great acting,real drama,so many claps you will do if you're communicating will with watching the movie

"The best word to describe the film is ""epic"". If you rewind time back to ten years ago and tell me a superhero movie can be this grandiose, this emotional and this impactful I wouldn't believe a word you say. Endgame does everything any Marvel fan could want, it serves as a tearful, emotional goodbye to some of the staples of The Universe and as a wonderful way to look forward to what is yet to come. It serves each and every single character from the past ten years justice and allows all of their personalities to flow out. The amount of work the team has put into this, the respect it has to this wondrous world of imagination is unfathomable to me, and the tribute it pays to past works deserves the utmost respect. This is truly the epitome of modern cinema, it doesn't need a killer plot (which it isn't), it is the fruit of ten years of hard work and pent-up emotion all unleashed in one single blow. Endgame is dare I say the perfect way wrap up phase one of Marvel Cinema, and makes me truly look forward to phase two.",positive
"This movie has been highly anticipated. I prepared for it. Saw all the MCU MOVIES and took a friend along who is even nerdier than I am.
A masterpiece work of art by the Russo Brothers and truly worth every second of it",positive
"Wow. Just wow. This movie has connected so many theories and dots that have been idealized throughout the cinematic extravaganza of The Avengers.
Having everyone come back in one seen was inspirational, exciting, and captivating. Though we have to say goodbye to some beloved heroes, they leave behind their strengths and courage.
It was definitely worth going to the 1:10AM screening to witness this valiant story. I truly hope the Endgame isn't the official end.
Be prepared to laugh, cry, and cheer throughout this movie, trust me it's worth it.",positive
"An incredible journey, emotions, story, action etc.
Only one word.................. No Word",positive
"Marvel Studios' 'Avengers: Endgame' is the end of a journey 11 years and 21 films in the making. This journey began in 2008's 'Iron Man', the film that launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and every Marvel Studios film since then has led us here. I assure you though, 'Endgame' is the PERFECT ending to the 'Infinity Saga', as it's been dubbed. The film revolves around the remaining Avengers trying to undo the catastrophic loss of life brought on by Thanos in last year's 'Avengers: Infinity War'. Eventually, with the help of Scott Lang/Ant-Man, they discover a way to go back in time via the microscopic Quantum Realm and try to steal the 6 Infinity Stones and bring back all the lives that were lost. The film's runtime is a little over 3 hours, but that's because there's a LOT of story to tell, and not a SECOND of it feels slow or unnecessary. From the opening scene, 'Endgame' grabs your attention with the force of the Infinity Gauntlet and refuses to let go! The film's directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, manage to juggle a vast amount of main characters and story threads BRILLIANTLY, without ever making the story feel boring or rushed. Everything flows PERFECTLY from one scene to the next, and (at least in my opinion) never gets confusing or hard to follow. Well, there actually is ONE scene where Bruce Banner explains how time-travel works in the MCU, and I didn't really understand it, but it's time-travel so no one knows FOR SURE how it actually works. Other than that, I understood everything just fine. Now, onto the acting. 'Endgame' features some of the BEST acting performances I've EVER seen in a Marvel movie, from Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/ Captain America), Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (Clint Barton/Hawkeye), Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man), but the standout performance is definitely, without a doubt given by Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man). I'm not kidding when I say RDJ deserves an Oscar for his performance. The film also has THE BEST third act in the HISTORY of comic book movies. It's nothing short of ASTONISHING how they were able to pull that off, but they did, and it was the greatest thing my eyeballs have ever witnessed. There's a very emotional scene towards the end of the movie where, for the first time in my 20 years of life, I FULL-ON ugly-cried watching it. It was bad. I pretty much cried from that scene until the end of the movie, so I HIGHLY recommend you bring tissues. Maybe an adult diaper too, because you are NOT gonna wanna get up to pee. So, to wrap this up, 'Endgame' is more than just a movie. It's the cinematic event of a lifetime, the likes of which I doubt we'll see again for a VERY long time. It's a love-letter to Marvel fans who have been on this journey for the past 11 years, and it's everything I ever wanted it to be. I know I said this last year about 'Infinity War', but THIS time I'll emphasize it more: 'Avengers: Endgame' is the GREATEST comic book movie of ALL-TIME.",positive
"This superhero movie does it all. It will make you laugh, cry and go beaming with excitement. This movie met everybody's expectations ; might I say even exceeded them, and won our hearts and entertained us yet again on the largest scale possible.Although some may find the first half of the movie a bit slow and long (but definitely not boring) , it is essential as it covers a lot of ground , and is nevertheless fun to watch and ultimately leads us to what will be known forever as the MOTHER OF ALL CLIMAXES.",positive
"A poor finish to the avengers saga.
Too many characters with not enough to do.
The final battle was underwhelming.
Some of the main characters (Thor,hulk) reduced to buffoonery.
Some good points like cap and Starks final ending.
Thanos is probably one of the best baddies ever.
The guardian's and antman were poor.
Far too long a film and was padded in places although I can forgive it because we probably wo t be seeing the actors continuing in their roles.
Not as disappointing as game of thrones though.
Younger viewers will love it.",positive
All I can say is that everything that you want to happen happens but there is also things that I didn't expect to happen but all good things. Simply this is a fitting end to the saga 10/10!!!!,positive
"A fairly entertaining hero movie that, even with its long running time, doesn't really feel tiring. It begins interestingly and in pure Avengers style it becomes more and more chaotic as time progresses. This is a consequence of the too many storylines that need to be merged and the too many characters that are to be followed. Tonal shifts are omnipresent and a few characters are thrown out of context for the sake of unnecessary comic relief. With the story progressing, typical cliches of ending stories become apparent and unexplained convenient turn of events start to happen. This is nothing new and, as in the previous movies, sometimes it's just impossible to make sense of how and why a situation occurs. You have to accept it for the sake of the storyline be it someone suddenly becoming overpowered, acquiring a new power or conveniently stumbling upon a revelation. In the end, an unimpressive and quite predictable storyline spiced with great effects, a good soundtrack and a few interesting characters.",positive
My 9 year old after 30 mins of watching asked me if we were in the right theater. It went worse from there.,negative
"Avengers: Endgame was the perfect conclusion to the current MCU as we know it. The intricate focus to details that call back to practically all the previous 21 films is genius. There are great laughs, emotional cries and overwhelmingly exciting surprises. To any fan of the MCU that's followed these beloved characters since Day 1, this is everything and more. I loved it.",positive
"Very good film i really enjoyed it it was cool loads of action obviously and both funny and quite sad , the only problem i have is did it really need to be 3 hours long .....?",positive
"This movie isn't perfect. But i feel like Endgame is actually pretty amazing because it has more characters than any other movie and somehow manages to give a conclusive ending to all of them along with 11 years of the Infinity saga.The Portals scene means so much to me and billions across the world, a conclusion to everything we love and I'd never have it any other way.",positive
"Just very satisfied, very entertained, and very much wanting to see it again and again! Also, very happy to have been a part of the whole saga and very much wanting to share this experience with our grandkid. What a ride!",positive
"It's time for the MCU to get the recognition it deserves. Endgame is a masterpiece, well written, acted and directed. No need for the Oscars in 2020, just give all the awards to the Avengers cast and crew.",positive
"After the events of Avengers: Infinity War, Ant-Man contacts the Avengers with an idea.This is a highly enjoyable crowd-pleaser from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.In three hours of running time it covers all the ground required for a worthy end to the infinity stones era.The story dedicates a lot of quality time to character arcs, whilst also delivering a mcguffin driven sci-fi adventure and an epic final confrontation.For me the best aspects of the movie are the character moments. In the first hour, by MCU standards, there is a small amount of visual spectacle in favour of focus on individuals and setting up what is to come. This cleverly introduces the stakes and compels the audience to invest in the outcome. It also provides plenty of humorous banter and self-referential comedy. A movie with dialogue that makes fun of its own sci-fi concept and genre categorisation has to be appreciated.The sci-fi adventure dominates the middle section of the movie as it becomes more plot driven and the action spectacle starts to increase. Whilst it is a lot of fun, I didn't find it as gripping as what came before. There are quite distinct shifts in tone as it cuts from one group of characters to the next, with some scenes feeling ominous, others quite heartfelt and a few played entirely for laughs. I don't think it's badly done, it's just a bit uneven as a result of sending the characters on several different missions and the persistence of using Thor for comic value. If it was taken too seriously and made more elaborate, it could have dragged on for too long or ended up a confusing mess, particularly for viewers who either haven't seen certain other MCU movies or cannot remember their plot details. I think the writers took the right option by keeping it as simple as possible.It's in the final third of the movie when most of the major spectacle occurs. There is little details I can mention without spoiling, but it is safe to say it's big, heroic, loud, violent, colourful, rousing, and satisfying on an epic scale. Importantly the characters do not get lost amongst the visual effects and there are some wonderfully emotional moments thrown in for good measure.If you look hard enough there are plot holes and you could question some of the sci-fi, but to take it that seriously and complain about such details would be rather sad. It is three hours of very strong escapism and if you go with the flow you should enjoy.As usual with Marvel the impressiveness of the production values is off the charts, with a ridiculous amount of superpowers and large scale conflict on display that all look quite real.All actors produce great performances, particularly Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner, Scarlet Johansson, Karen Gillan and Paul Rudd.For me it's an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",positive
"Endgame was definitely better than infinity war. Luckily they did not make the mistake of staring all marvel heroes on every planet and in space (or at least not for the main part). This film was literally about cleaning up the huge mess infinity war left behind. Better, but far from the great first 2 parts of this series. A very slow pace, overly long, far fetched story full of plot holes. Some nice elements though like the ""back to the future"" part. And as expected there was the obligatory tear jerking part at the end.",positive
"I remember back in 2008 at the cinema, seeing Iron Man for the first time and was just blown away by Downey Jr.'s performance, and the excellent and funny script with one of several incredible origin stories.Endgame is the 22nd consecutive film in the MCU and just to imaging that they would pull of this 10 year, Multi-Billion dollar project is almost too much to comprehend.Endgame is a perfect mix of seriousness, humour, epic battles and a farewell to the movies and characters we've all come to love so much.After my second watch I upgraded this movie to 10/10. Endgame is everything I could have ever hoped for and truly the perfect ending to the best Super Hero series of films ever made.",positive
Just got back from the midnight showing and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I get that its the final avengers movie but they spent two hours paying homage to previous films and characters and retread a lot of the original plot. In doing so they effectively dulled Thanos's presence and much of the enjoyment of the movie. I hate to say it but Captain Marvel seemed like a useless addition as she really didn't bring much to the table and her presence ruins Thanos's threat. Anyway the production values were great and it was nice to see all the characters make an appearance in some form but it wasn't bet foot to go out on.,positive
This movie has a terrible plot and could be the worst movie I've ever seen,negative
"That 3 hours just flew by too fast! Never have I been in a movie as packed as this theater was and as lively as the crowd was. There was cheering several times during the movie and crying from some at certain times, gasping and shouting lol! This moviehad it all including almost every person ever involved in a Marvel movie (except Coulsen) but I'm binging Agents of Shield with my GF right now so we'll get our Coulsen fix later lol! Sad to say goodbye to many years of Marvel movies but excited for phase 4!",positive
"I watched the movie twice so that I can give a proper review and get clarity on my thoughts . The first time watching the movie was a rollercoaster ride but the second time around I could appreciate it much more ...
Yes there are many flaws in the movie without a doubt but it gives an amazing closure to most of our beloved characters.
Joy and sadness ....",positive
"The biggest blockbuster of the world. Undoubtedly it's the best movie of my life. The ending made worth all 22 movies. You can't take your eyes off the movie for a single moment. It's the highest grossing movie of all time. Acting, direction, carecter development, screenplay, visual effects, BGM, dialogues everything is outstanding, there is nothing new to say about that. And the final battle... It's just marvelous. I don't have words that can explain how much I love the Avengers movie series. This film made me emotional at the same. Some of my favorite characters will never be seen again. No new character can take their place. And finally....
AVENGERS ASSEMBLE.",positive
"Honestly I was in the cinema with my sister, the death of iron man just made me cry. A character i grow up watching and loving since i was a kid just dies. Like losing something special. Also Black widow and Captain america ripped my heart too.",positive
"This movie was the end of 22 movies... Supposed to be the most intense movie of all time. Yet infinity war had way more emotion and way better script. I even think that age of ultron was better. All they focused on was linking all the 22 movies into one and fan service. I feel for that reason it wasn't as impactful as infinity war. The way they end the characters stories was ok, i would have done it differently and done something that would make your heart drop, like they did in the first 5 min of the movie. And also they did something to a certain character and all i can say is WHY, SO STUPID. 7 may seem like a descent rating but i am very disappointed because this movie had unlimited potential and now i'll never get to see the endgame i wanted to.",positive
"I managed to attend a double bill of this and Infinity War last night with Endgame being the midnight movie.
Going to a midnight showing takes alot of effort as you are disrupting your working week to watch a movie until 3 am, but it seems to be the only way to avoid having the movie spoiled.
Was it worth the upheaval? In short yes. This definitely delivers as the franchise closer. This is a very dark movie at the beginning and while their is alot going on story wise (there are alot of character story arcs to deal with) it feels like a resolution to the overall narrative.
This could be problematic for some people who haven't seen every movie in the franchise as stories are resolved from characters origins movies.
As is the standard with this franchise the action scenes and effects are so well done that watching other superhero movies can pale in comparison. The blending of the different character universes is seamless and the fun is watching the interactions of the characters.
All action, twists, humour and emotion which you have come to expect in these movies is here.
If you have managed to resist looking for spoilers online then see it as soon as possible, because people will want to discuss this movie. If you are the type of actively went looking for them then you may have ruined the movie for yourself as one of the numerous rumoured plot lines is real. You only have yourself to blame.
Endgame doesn't have the same heavyweight emotional punch that Infinity War does but they were never going to top THAT ending. Although there were men crying in the screening I attended and tried to pretend they weren't.
This appears to be a definite ending to this particular story arc as there is NO post credit scene, so you are know equipped with the knowledge to beat the crowds at the end.
No spoilers and a handy tip? You don't get that from every IMDB reviewer!",positive
"It was not a great movie, the previous movie was much better and I mean a lot. It could and should have been better but they tried to play it safe. I did enjoy the movie but when people talk about standing ovation I just roll my eyes. This is what worries me to much of this from fan boys that can see know wrong most watch without seeing.Even though I did like this move some parts just bug me like the messy theories of time travel. Infact they made a mess of time travel theory and please dont tell me oh yeah its the Grandfather Paradox. The fact is so much was dependent on the past that if Thanos didnt do all those things as well as some of the others then much of the present would not be the same regardless of how you put it. The Guardians of the Galaxy would never had met Gamora so they would not know her etc",positive
A gripping three hour movie that evades blockbuster action movie tropes. Genuinely funny in a quip-free sort of way.,positive
"After how awesome Infinity War was, I was expecting so much more from Endgame, but maybe that's my fault. I'll not list all the faults as most people have covered them in their reviews (and they are all correct). 3 hours of movie and only about 15 minutes of that is action. Strangest thing is Thanos' strength and power.......seems to match whoever he is fighting at the time, whether with or without infinity stones, 1 opponent or 5, it just doesn't make sense and don't get me started on timelines or Captain Marvel!!",positive
Too long for bad plot. The movie is 3 t 1 min use your time better!,negative
"Too many jokes which make the movie very long to watch, but the end is totally worth it! Nice way to end those beautiful movies!",positive
"I wanna start this review by saying i'm a huge marvel comics fan, and a big fan of the movies as well. This film was gorgeous, its a fun superhero time traveling experience, after the ending conclusion of infinity war, the last surviving avengers must assemble to undo what Thanos has done by going back in time using the quantum realm in order to succeed in their quest (Time Heist) to find the infinity stones before the previous Thanos obtains them. This movie is well written and is full of action, drama, comedy, and mystery. If you haven't seen avengers infinity war, I recommend not watching this movie until you have seen it first or else you will be very lost. The movie is three hours but don't worry, the movie makes up for it with its brilliant entertainment, for me the movie only felt like two hours, that's how much you'll enjoy it if your a hardcore marvel fan like me and have seen all the films in the infinity saga.",positive
"I am just about to watch this movie for the 5th time and many more after this.. and I just wanted to come on here and maybe hope the makers of this movie sees my review, that I love the MCU movies that lead up to this great ending. Thank you for the awesome stories. It's been one hell of a ride.",positive
I saw it in theaters with my kid. We were both laughing and crying on the edge of our seat.,positive
"We really loved the movie. Had some complaints though. I wish Hulk would have made a ""full"" appearance and after so much hype, Captain Marvel did close to nothing. Other than that, we thought the move was very well made. It had enough action and details to hold us over for the approx. 3 hour duration.",positive
"No spoilers.
BEST movie saga wrap-up of ALL TIME!
I've never seen a movie that was too good to spoil. It's that good!",positive
Unfortunately its wasn't that much goodThe characters not taken the same space as infinity war where we seen all of them with there true power,positive
"AVENGERS - EndGame : Well it was a long wait for millions of Marvel fans out there in the world (who were not snapped yet by Thanos), while going though the different theories and predictions by many geniuses and analysts.
It just falsifies majority of the predictions
And it was worth the wait. The movie outshines in every field comedy, drama, emotions and not be missed mindblowing Action (of 25 odd minutes at the end).Thor kept the fun part going all through the emotional ups and downs. While it revolved around Captain America and Iron Man as expected for the emotion and actions. And gives a befitting farewell to two strong pillars of last 10 years of Marvel History.Not to give any more spoilers, must watch this movie and enjoy a Grand farewell to so called Phase-1 of Marvel Avengers.",positive
"I usually don't like marvel or full arcade action movies but when I notice the high rating I thought It worth to give it a try. What I found is a soap opera of bunch of super heroes. Crying, cuddling, over sensitive. Even Hulk himself was taking selfies like a princess. WTF !Besides, there was only 15 minutes of action in a 3 hours movie. I have never seen so overrated movie on the site before.Enjoy !",positive
Dreadful and far far far to politically correct.Ultra left hug fest,negative
Everything Marvel has to offer is brought on the table by this film,positive
"Endgame wraps up the entire MCU in a nice little bow and allows you a decision: stop watching Marvel products and feel a sense of closure, or keep watching and use Endgame as a springboard for what's to come. Either way, this is an incredibly satisfying movie. The only reason I couldn't give it 10/10 is because this also, sadly, reinforced how much I hate Captain Marvel and Brie Larson; her five or six minutes of screen time were the only minutes that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.",positive
"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Technically well done, this sci-fi blockbuster will entertain most moviegoers, especially its rabid fanbase.JIM'S REVIEW: Before sharing my critic-proof and spoiler-proof review of this year's biggest blockbuster sequel, let me state that Avengers: Endgame is a worthy follow-up to 2018's mega-hit, Avengers: Infinity Wars. Fans needed to wait a whole year for Part Two for answers to questions which left them hanging in fine cliff-hanging tradition.But first, my own nagging question...does anyone really die in sci-fi ?Resurrection and The Moral Good must triumph. Besides, everyone loves a comeback. After all, this is a fantasy adventure in a sci-fi world and there is a set formula. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeeley take the inevitable logical plot device to foil Thanos' plan at universal domination, which shouldn't surprise anyone who has read comic books as a child. Many battles will ensue, which makes up most of the film's action and sub-plots. (However, it must be said, that there was one glaring leap of logic involving one unnamed character stealing the Tesseract, the movie's McGuffin, that remains unanswered.)Epic in scope and length (nearly 3 hours), the film is a satisfying thrill ride, although it does take awhile to assemble the gang. Much (too much) time is spent with sketchy character development and tons of exposition. While most of the storytelling seizes upon engaging interactions with its more colorful assortment of characters, there are still some missed opportunities. The film is also anti-climactic and could have used some judicious editing despite its crowd-pleasing goals to tidy up all loose ends.Still, Avengers: Endgame is an amazing accomplishment which should please the series' fanbase. The filmmakers assembles many, if not all, of the Marvel superheroes, both major and minor. The actors reprise their roles with varying degrees of importance and excitement. Some register as insignificant cameos and walk-ons; others provide strong contributions to the film; a few characters simply mystify their existence within the Marvel family. The film makes strides to impress its audience with its sheer magnitude and cast of thousands and takes its own mythology very seriously and, for the most part, succeeds.Technically adept, much of the movie has top-notch CGI visuals and well staged action sequences directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Also impressive is their seamless handling of previous footage from other Marvel movies and their reenactments within a parallel dimension. The music score by Alan Silvestri is highly effective and Trent Opaloch's cinematography adds atmosphere and style. The editing team of Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt keep the interlocking episodes moving and allow the action to be clearly viewed, a rarity in today's blurry techno-shoot-em-ups.Some of the actors provide more memorable star turns than others. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Paul Rudd, Mark Ruffalo, and Josh Brolin do a yeoman-like job. Jeremy Renner may sport a new hair-do-over, but his low-tier character still lacks considerable interest, The heroines portrayed by Scarlett Johansson, Elizabeth Olsen, and Brie Larson remain underwritten and underwhelming, despite a very forced woman's empowerment battle moment that serves only as a contrived sign of the times.Avengers: Endgame is far from the final stage of this film franchise. As comic book superhero movies go, this is one of the better efforts. In this ""final"" version, some superheroes perish, a few fade from memory, but most survive...as does this series. It will goes on...and on, making this one of the most profitable franchises in movie history.So let me re-phase my opening question in this review: Does any sci-fi really die?",positive
"CHARACTERS
Avengers end game is the best MCU movie to ever be created imo.
Some of the characters (like Tony and Rogers) were greatly developed
Ronin went from something terrible happening to him and that changed him as a person and after he decided to have hope another conflict ensued on him.
Ronin was developed good but they could have done way more.
Like him being easily convinced to save everyone was not that cool and he really should have had more conflict to make him a better character.
Tony has had the greatest character arc in this whole entire Franchise.
Going to not caring about lives to trying to save every single one of them and his death is great.
Steve Rogers the virtuous guy who has gone through alot decided on a decision that changed him and made him learn. And him lifting the hammer was amazing.
Heck even Nebula had a great character arc.
She went from trying to kill Gotg to actually trying to save the world and it's pretty compelling actually
Thor is comedy gold but the character arc he had could have been way better but it wasn't
Hulk is also pretty funny but he never got used that much.
Captain Marvel felt a bit like a Deus ex machine and it got pretty annoying but I'm glad she wasn't in the movie that much.VILLAIN
Thanos was actually a good villain as well.
He wanted to make half of the people disappear but he knew that it wouldn't work so he changed his ideology to destroy and rebuild and it shows how greatly compelling he is and he is one of the greatest MCU villains.TIMELINE
The timeline was handled recentely but I have one question I just want to be answerd cause it makes me really confused.
So after the Thanos snap the movie is played in the year 2023 and then everyone that died in 2018 comes back alive in 2023.
I can understand that they look the same age as when they died in the movie but my problem is shouldn't Ned and Peter be out of high school since Peter came back alive in the year 2023.
That's the only thing that confuses me when it comes to this movie and I want an answer. (I know the answer now but I won't delete this cause I want you guys to see my stupidity)VERDICT
The ending was truly great and I th8nk the MCU should have just stopped at Endgame bit sadly 20 more movies has to be made.
But nothing I tell you will top endgame cause imo it feels like the most Marvel comicy movie out of all the 21 movies.",positive
"I'd rate it as #2 or #3 with Avengers 2/3 being the best out there.Feels like the director is trying to put too much in one movie (albeit 3 hours) and the first 1 hour and half trying to setup a cue for the rest of the story gets a bit boring.The climax was too short.Visuals were top notch.Captain Marvel is just as cocky as ever.Still, good movie.",positive
"""Avengers: Endgame"" Review
(11/10)I didn't think Marvel would ever be able to top Infinity War, but I was wrong. Marvel delivers a fitting and surprisingly poetic payoff to the Infinity Saga.
The less you know going into Avengers: Endgame, the more you're likely to enjoy it. Obviously, you wouldn't have clicked on a review of this movie if you didn't want to know something about the culmination of a decade's worth of Marvel's superhero storytelling, but trust me: more than Avengers: Infinity War, Endgame is truly a story that needs to be experienced. Forget all the external noise from the deliberately vague teaser trailers, perfectly-calibrated celebrity soundbites, and footage leaks, and just strap in for the ride.
There's little that can be said about the film without at least alluding to its twists, but what I can say, with certainty, is that Avengers: Endgame is a marvel, both in terms of narrative scale and sheer logistical ambition. The film walks a tightrope between high drama and cathartic comedy, offering some of the darkest and most emotionally honest scenes in the history of the MCU, alongside some of the most ridiculous and sublime. There are fewer laugh-out-loud moments here than in Infinity War, but it's certainly lighter and oftentimes more joyous than you might expect from a story that begins with the fallout from Thanos' snap.
Endgame is a film that feels like it was made by fans, for fans - to the point where some scenes will undoubtedly be labeled as outright fanservice. But it's hard to view those moments as cynical pandering so much as earned and effective homages to the moments, characters, and relationships we've grown so invested in over the past 11 years. While Infinity War did its best to juggle an enormous roster of heroes spanning the entirety of the MCU's history, it's no spoiler to say Endgame rightly narrows its focus to the original six Avengers, giving them each a well-deserved moment, or several in the spotlight. The cost of sidelining so many characters is high, but it pays off brilliantly.
I know it's not the end of the MCU, but it certainly feels like it. Endgame's greatest accomplishment is how it deepens our understanding and appreciation of the movies that preceded it. This is truly a climax to an entire franchise, not just a resolution to the cliffhanger of Infinity War. This may not have been the only way for Marvel to end the first chapter of its sprawling superhero saga, but when faced with 14,000,605 possible outcomes, it manages to be a surprising and satisfying one.",positive
"Not overly great, but that's when comparing it to Infinity War. The humour was good, if a little unnecessary at times. I'm afraid I found myself looking at my watch just a little too much. That said, a solid 7.",positive
"I've watched close to 10,000 movies in my 28 year lifetime, and this series had me in every emotion in this long journey. From Iron Man 1 to Spiderman Far From Home was just fantastic. Some movies were worse then others but Avengers End Game and Avengers Infinite War were by far the best. Incredible film",positive
"Well must say,i didnt watch the movie when it hit the theaters and althought i am a big fan of the franchise. I didnt expect a lot, thought i must be a slower pace to tell the story of the world that was created, yet.... it was damn to slow and borin. Without the death of Nat and Iron Man it would be like a Hallmark production. And even the final battle scene was like a copy paste from the last Averngers. Than Captain Marvel was like 5 sec to see, the funny part was only Thor and Hulk?! What the hell was that? I never liked Mark Ruffalo as Hulk but i let it pass, but here in the last Avengers... am actually glad i didnt get to see it in the cinema, would habe been waste of my money",positive
"3 hours long with 30 minutes of action, and all that action coming at the end so it's basically a 2 hr long drama with a pathetic final battle.This movie could of been 1 hr 30 max but they decide to drag on all the conversations that are all pointless anyway, Hawkeye gets more screen time then basically anyone and who cares anyway.They destroyed hulk and made him and Thor a complete joke, overpowered captain America and this movie should of just been called iron man 4Hulk dabbing and Thor playing fornite just came across as try hard and I can't believe how boring an avengers movie could be.Such hype for such a let down, anyone who reviews this movie as a 10 has absolutely no idea, how can this movie be a 10 it absolutely bores you for 2 hours then throws in some trash 30 mins at the end which is mostly Hawkeye and captain America fighting anyway which are 2 of the weakest characters and Thanos beats everyone so easily with no stones while hulk almost drowns from nothing lolThis movie was an absolute joke I hope Russo brothers don't make another marvel movie because this was an absolute boring peice of crap and they are destroying hulk and Thor",negative

"A+, Epic, Amazing, Phenomenal. They tied the entire series of 21 movies together almost perfectly. Movie making at its absolute finest.
The only question now is, how can Marvel ever top it?",positive
"The biggest minus is, the movie is rushed up. Way too many things to solve and conclude even in this marathon of three hours. Some lost battle opportunities between some characters, plot holes, lazy writing and not enough explained things. But you cannot explain everything and please everybody in a superhero movie. Maybe a trilogy of 7 hours in total, instead of two movies of 5.40 cumulated would have been better.
Anyway. The movie is not bad. It has some good performances, especially RDJ's one, it is emotional, it has totally unexpected turns and of course the pretty CGI.
It is worth the wait and worth seeing it in cinema 3D. But don't you dare drink something before, or until the last half hour. 3h long, remember?",positive
It had a few actually funny scenes a few great action scenes and incredible ending. Making this movie 3 hours did nothing but draw it out to be tedious and boring. It had the potential to be the 9.1 rating people are giving it if editing had trimmed a lot more of the fat. Way over rated.,positive
"This was a solid movie, with my only complaint being the pacing during an important focal point. While the movie was three hours long, it felt like it needed to be four to tell the complete narrative. However, it was a good story that brings the entirety of the MCU to an interesting point.Well done.Real Score: 7.9",positive
Dont get me wrong I did enjoy the film the first hour and a half I felt was a bit pointless but then wow it was amazing so I feel 7 is all it deserves due to the start,positive
Majorly disappointed. It didn't have as much character development as I would've hoped for M' Baku.,negative
"Topsy turvy. One minute you're happy, the next you're wondering why you're sad. Fantastic finish to an excellent group of films. Gutted it's all ended for this generation but times change I guess. It's been a long and emotional rollercoaster, enjoyable, gripping and funny when it was needed. I hope Captain Marvell remains the same and has more films ahead (because she is hot and we don't see enough of her). Meh. Don't know what else to say. Feels like the end of an era, which it is. Roll on the next generation.",positive
What an ending to an era of Marvel movies. There are scenes when your heart goes out to the characters. The story starts out slowly but catches momentum and by the end you are gripping your seats in anticipation. And it is beautiful how each character is given space and importance. Truly an epic movie which all Marvel fans will cherish...even the end credits.... What a way to close the movie.,positive
"Endgame is everything a grand finale should be. It's an epic drama that takes place in different time periods, involves multiple plot lines from other films, and neatly, and (believably) wraps up many unresolved issues. At 3hrs in length, there are occasional slow spots, but this is forgivable given the emotional depth of the subject matter here. (I wouldn't take young kids with short attention spans.)
As expected, however... It also holds you in suspense, excites, and even makes you laugh, though not quite as often as previous Marvel outings... This one leans toward the dramatic. Rest assured, you'll leave satisfied, and maybe teary-eyed... Easily the best of the bunch, and obviously a labor of love for all involved. (Reviewer is 50)",positive
Avengers infinity war left us in such a state of mind where we didn't know what was going to happen next. We start off mourning the loss of our heroes and need to find out how to bring them back. Without spoiling anything all I will say is this movie is amazing and definately one I'm glad to have seen in the cinema which made the experience that much better.However I do recommend watching infinity war first as it is a direct follow up and also amazing!,positive
Most satisfying ending ever. My childhood is complete.,positive
"The perfect blend of action, comedy and emotion and it all works really well",positive
"I like superhero flicks. Being honest though, there is a certain 'sameness' to most of them. Avengers: Endgame could be called the granddaddy of all superhero movies, I suppose. At just a touch over 3 hours long, it is certainly far longer than most. It probably features more superheroes than most too. At one point, I think every Marvel superhero that ever existed was on screen - (except, curiously, the X-Men). Yes, a lot of time, effort, creativity and money - lots of money - went into this. Sadly, it left me feeling kind of flat. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but I didn't love it. In fact, I didn't feel anything when it was over - no sadness at the losses incurred, no exhilaration at the victories. Nothing. I never found myself on the edge of my seat once. This may have been Marvel's great battle-of-our-time movie, but it was no Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (now THAT was a movie that pulled you in!). So, I guess we're left asking where to now Marvel? Do we care? I know I'll keep watching what you put out, but the lustre is starting to wear thin.",positive
Will tug on the old heart strings and will be one of the best movies you will ever see.,positive
"The cgi effects are horrible, has parts where it looks like Shrek.. the move is way too long, to many useless scenes, just boring. I barely made it in 3 attempts",positive
"Badly made. First hour felt like thrown together in few minutes. Some jokes just went out too far, I was really hoping them to go away towards the end... But no. Many characters simply ruined forever, which makes no sense. I did not enjoy the movie
Most of the people will say this is good because of the Fan hype. I'm a Marvel fan all the way, but this just wasn't it.",negative
"It is a little slow starting off, but there is good reason for it. Half the universe population died. Everyone is grieving still. The last half of the movie had me happy, sad, angry, and then begging for more. When cap took mjolnir.....I started clapping in my theater seat. I was squealing like a kid on christmas to see that happen and how he was doing combos with his shield and mjolnir..........GOD! It was something special. Long live iron man.
Favorite Quote: "" That is America's ass.""",positive
"Game changer. Spectacular. EPIC.This is EPIC because they have perfected the blend of what to keep and what to throw, recycles yet made it even better, blend of same and differences, they achieve thru the pros and cons in the audience experience... you will see inspiration and reference...it's a HOMAGE to all the Easter Eggs of the Easter Eggs. you would clap at some of the scene, cry at some scene, wanna scream, wanna jump, and you leave with honour and proud... a sense of calmness, and say, they did a fine job. as all GOOD vs EVIL movies should be... but this one is raise the bar for blockbusters.What is better than LEGEND? And making the promise that they will keep their promise.
Spoiler Alert-- --It's like Marvel trying to tell us, they will not make another Iron Man movie unless Robert Downey Jr. is starting.
What is better than LEGEND?LEGACY",positive
"Now i might be from the minority, but the first couple of hours of this movie were not that great. However, the last hour was just a mix of amazing and amazinnger",positive
"Best movie
Its include all satisfied ending for all characters, which are doing 11 year hard work on it but in movie not justified on stronger base characters halk & thor.....
Anyway movie more EMOTIONAL as compare to action...... So Enjoy movie & hurry before anyone spoil",positive
"After seeing it 3 times it does not have as many plot holes as i initialy thought. One of the most solid time travel plots. Really liked they made time travel with different timelines like in Dragon Ball Z and not like 12 monkeys, that would have removed any sense from it.",positive
The fight scene was epic! I had to rewatch it over and over!,positive
"Endgame wraps up the decade of MCU nicely. A little too nicely. Too many loose ends tied up without any explanation, while tracking through all the movies so far. All the characters from 21 films showed up, even some cameos. Hell, even Natalie Portman showed up! But was that necessary??But the problem in the end was the amount of time spent wallowing in sorrow, which meant that all that brilliant cast of heroes were short-changed, when the time came for them to step up. Doctor Strange brought everyone back and then barely did anything, Black Panther ran for 5 seconds, Shuri was right of frame for all of 5 seconds, Winter Soldier took a couple of shots, I could go on...The emotional moments were not emotional enough, especially Tony's death. Spidey's fade in Infinity War was heart-breaking, Tony's death barely registered. Natasha sobbed for a few frames and then sacrificed herself, quickly forgotten 30 seconds later. I would have been fine with Cap dying in the battle against Thanos, because his life was suddenly made selfish at the end. Which is completely ridiculous, after building that legacy all through these movies.In the end, had it not been for Cap, I would have scored this movie a 5. Him picking up Mjolnir was just pure gold",positive
"SPOILER WARNING!!!!going into this movie I was expecting it to be a good film, but I was blown away. I will be going to see it a second time sometime in the next week.From the trailers and teasers they released before the films release, I thought that there could be some early fight back against Thanos, but to see him decapitated was a complete shock. I didn't believe for one minute that this would be the last we saw of him though, and I was right. But the way that they re introduced him was a huge shock. The contrast from how Thanos was portrayed in Infinity War to Endgame was huge. We didn't need much if any Thanos screen time apart from major plot points and we didn't get any. Infinity War was Thanos' film, Endgame belongs to the heroes. And they didn't fail to deliver.They plot of the film was laid on pretty early, after the (I know I'm over using this word, I really could use a Thesaurus) shocking 5 year time jump which I never saw a jump of that length of time coming. They split into teams with one objective: go back in time to gather the infinity stones for themselves. And boy was that a fun part of this film. Seeing different angles, and behind the scenes as such moments from previous movies was the best way they could mark a film 10 years in the making: re visit previous films. Although many predicted this would happen, it was still incredible to see them actually do it. The reappearance of many known characters was great. From seeing The Ancient One, Rumlow, Loki again in New York, to seeing Jane Foster and Thor's Mother again on Asgard, it was brilliant.When Hawkeye and Black Widow arrived on Vormir to find the Soul Stone, I think everyone in the cinema knew what they needed to do, but didn't want to believe it. When the who will it be scene was playing out with each hero trying to sacrifice themselves, even when they wanted to make you think this is the end for the Black Widow, I was thinking 'no way will they kill her off, Hawkeye's time is up'. Well I couldn't of been more wrong, could I? She managed to sacrifice herself and that was the first of many occasions during this film my jaw was open in (yes I know, gimme a break) shock.After all the stones had been recovered by our heroes, they returned to Avengers HQ to build a glove and bring back their friends using the same snap Thanos did to get rid of them in the first place. Snap complete, and Laura Barton was on hand with her phone to reveal that they were back. 2014 Nebula, who played a really big role in this film, had already done her job in creating a window for her Father to enter through. Que 2014 Thanos' (honestly the amount of times my phone has written Thanks rather than Thanos is killing me) explosive entrance, in which I genuinely thought Ant-Man was a gonner, and the stage was set for the final FINAL shockdown. I MEAN SHOWDOWN. SHOOWWDOWN.All of our dusted heroes reappearing was probably my favourite moment from this 3 hour spectacle. Seeing the gathering of everyone we know, even Pepper in an iron suit for crying out loud, and Thanos never stood a chance. And by the way, the reunion of Peter Parker and Tony Stark was the scene that made me the most emotional. After a big final battle, featuring a brilliant team up of all the MCUs female heroes, it was down to the one and only Tony Stark to snap his own Infinity Gauntlet and get rid of Thanos for good. This was it. This was how that 1 chance in 14,000,605 outcomes had to happen. Tony Stark sacrificing himself to save the universe. And what made this even more special? The ""I am Iron Man"" quote that would be the last words to come from Tony Stark (well, a living Tony Stark at least). Cue the tears in the cinema, and my god did some people cry. There were people physically sobbing so loudly I struggled to here what was being said after. Yes, seriously. As big a death as this was, I think deep down a lot of people saw this one coming.After the snap, we see Tony's funeral where the camera pans through everyone there, including the kid from Iron Man 3 for some weird reason I still don't understand. And seeing Tony's daughter telling Happy she wants a cheeseburger was another brilliant throwback to where the MCU all started in Iron Man. Then comes the time for the reality stones to be put back where they belong in time. And who better to achieve this than Captain America. And what a way for Steve Rogers to go. He decided to stay in the past and live out his live the way he was intended. He finally got that dance with Peggy Carter, and lives to a ripe old age where we see him just seconds after he left the present. He chats with Sam Wilson and hands him the Captain America shield with Bucky looking on. For me, the perfect way to end Steve Rogers' story. And seeing Thor joining the Guardians of the Galaxy has got me SUPER excited.Overall this was by far my favourite MCU movie to date. It was brilliant. I laughed, I cheered and of course I cried. The perfect way to end 10 years worth of movies. 3 of the original 6 avengers are gone, but the future of the MCU is looking bright, and super duper exciting. I know there's a LOT I've missed out, but my fingers are hurting so this is all your getting. I can't wait to watch this again. It really was the Endgame.",positive
"The movie is way longer than it should be, a lot of stalling and useless details. I mean captain marvel comes in like 4 scenes in the whole movie and when she comes she destroys everything in her path she could've just came in the beginning and the movie would've finished in maximum 90 mins with full of exciting action and a bit of sadness. i think they ruined 11 years worth of movies in 3 hours.",positive
"This was a terrible movie, no one and convince me otherwise. Over hyped and with a poor storyline. There were some good moments and scenes, sure. But overall? No. Just no.",negative
Overall the film had a very satisfying end to a decade long story.,positive
"This movie was not just about CGI but fantastic performances from the cast.
A movie is only as good as its villain (The dark knight is a perfect example) and Brolin as Thanos was absolutely impressive and menacing.
Watching the avengers getting battered a second time by Thanos was quite hard to watch. However, our favorite avengers fought back bravely. A honorable mention to captain America who was my preferred avenger- his handling of Myolnir was exceptional.",positive
"Just so so good. It absolutely deserves it's number one grossing film of all time. So much better than avatar, and a truly epic ending to an epic super story.",positive
"This is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen in my whole life!The special effects are incredible(like they would disappoint)it is the highest growing movies of all time,and it totally deserved it!Tony Stark's daughter is just adorable!Tony Stark dying would be shocking if NO ONE GAVE ME SPOILERS!!!Anyways all marvel fans recommend I would recommend this movie to people between the ages of 4-100",positive
Pacing issues but good emotional payoff. Could cut some scenes. Ambitious film with many different storylines that would normally bog down a film but works well here. Characters are well written and realized. Excellent action sequences but some unfocused shots. Tonal shifts done well.,positive
"Avengers: Endgame sums up the Infinity Saga perfectly. The dark tone of the movie was livened up by the humour and jokes in a natural, non-forced way. The CGI, acting, callbacks, soundtrack, plot and themes were flawless in execution.Australia isn't really the place where people cheer and applaud in cinemas but man did they cheer in this movie. When Cap finally yelled ""Avengers Assemble!"" and when he finally picked up Mjolnir, the theatre went rowdy. It was a chilling, exhilarating experience throughout.The ending was heartbreaking, traumatic and offered a glimmer of hope for the future of the MCU.",positive
"** some hints to spoilers but not a lot ** First, good job Marvel. You can tell from a lot of the rave reviews and the box office records that they are very effective with their Marvel Cinema Universe. You cannot deny that.However, personally, I think I out smarted myself. I read somewhere that one would not be prepared in terms of what to expect in this movie and that one would be blown away. Having read so many comics over the last 30 years, I went out to prove people wrong, and I did exactly that, predicted most of the plot points. Heheh, so i ended up a bit disappointed in the end. I probably would have enjoyed it more if i had no expectations.There were fun bits, and some wow moments, I enjoyed the Avengers Forever type plot-line, and A-Force type get together in the final battle, and finally i heard ""Avengers Assemble!"". However, I have to remember that the Russos directed this as fan boys themselves and put out what they personally wanted to see from the comics. In addition, this movie is really for those people who have been emotionally attached to the 20 so years of movies, loving certain actors/actresses, and characters.This movie was for those who were devastated or surprised by Avengers Infinity. I just don't happen to be part of that group and wanted to see a lot more deaths and hints to legacy characters. While we saw some of that - i thought they could have done more, and have a few more big sacrifices. It would not have mattered for future movies or tv series, because at one stage all of these characters have been replaced, or have successors. Final note. I still enjoyed it.",positive
"The movie has a ton of plotholes and things that you'll think about after the movie. That being said you should enjoy this movie if you're a Marvel fan. Many great actors, superheroes, action, etc. Must watch if you've been keeping up with all of the other MCU movies.",positive
"First two hours could be dispensed with. Thor is now a fat alcoholic with depression which is apparently funny? Tony has PTSD and anxiety. Hulk is comfort eating and wears clothes and takes selfies with kids. Awful movie. Hate what marvel did with some of the characters. The girl power moment is sickly, ant man is a joke character and at the end as a huge marvel fan I couldn't have cared less who died. I felt myself questioning more how much people were getting paid for 10 second cameos. Falcon is a great character on his own so why hand him the shield? Everything about this sucked. More plot holes than Gouda. 6/10 purely for 30 minutes of the battle scene minus the vomitous girl power bit. Making Thor and Hulk joke characters is an awful decision. Its less appealing to anyone over the age of 7...Cinema reaction said it all.",positive
Seriously? This is what everyone was talking about of being so brilliant? The plot has a lot of holes and also the movie is very long and boring until the third act,negative
"I liked the movie a lot!
It was a very good close to the saga of Avengers, although I did not like that they have destroyed the image of Thor by showing it as they did.
I did not expect the death of Black Widow and less the death of Iron Man.
Thanks for so many years of Avengers in the cinema.",positive
"Thank you marvel for this wonderful movie. This movie made me laugh, cry and excited. This Movie is the ending of The infinity saga . It is truly the endgame",positive
"I've been waiting for this film since April 2018 after Infinity War. I've read theories etc and the anxiety skyrocketed the two weeks leading up to the opening. Now that I've seen it I can say think Infinity War might be a 'better' film but that might only be because of the unique nature of it (the heroes having lost and the villain trying to be impartial). I think people who don't pay attention to the dialog in End Game will need to see the film more than once. On first glance even avid MCU fans well versed in all the films will say 'wait, but,....' until you remember what the characters who have spent time in space explain to those who have not.... so without spoiling thing folks might need to look at diagrams relative to the film ""Primer"" to fully understand what is being exercised in End Game.",positive
I'm a fan of sci-fi movies & following the marvel series I just enjoyed the endgame every second of it..,positive
"The waiting turns out to be worth it. Endgame is a satisfying, thrilling, dazzling, entertaining finale to MCU's story arch.The movie is long and the beginning is more about picking up the pieces and dealing with lost, thus it's purposely paced much slower than the rest. But that is the reason exactly why the movie is so emotionally impactful. After the final battle and all the sacrifices that were made, the silence was palpable in the theater.I can't find any scene, character, or dialogue that did not serve a purpose here.This is a wondeful action movie, a brilliance of special effects, and a masterpiece of a superhero movie. The MCU's crowning jewel.10/10",positive
"For everyone who has waiting after
""ifinity war"", this brings to an satisfied ending. MCU ""Avengers endgame"" will be remember for a long time.",positive
"If I hadn't grown up in the silver age of Marvel, if I hadn't worshipped the stories Stan wrote and the pictures Jack drew, if these iconic characters hadn't been modernised for a new generation with shorter attention spans and a need for 'comic' interludes, I'd have scored this higher. It's good. But I hate the lame humour and the modern take.
Having said that, I enjoyed the film.",positive
"There is not a story better than Avengers Endgame
Nuff said!",positive
"Another reviewer coined it perfectly in saying that the more you think about it, the bigger the problems rise to the surface...So, from first view, it's a great movie...it had the perfect balance of all the emotions needed to bring this 22 movie MCU chapter to a close...With that being said...spoilers ahead as I bring to light the most glaring issues:1. The plot device that Nebula ""syncs"" up with her past self actually creates the exact paradox issue that Bruce and others say can't happen. Also, from a scientific stand point, the distance the ""syncing"" would need to travel would take longer than the future Avengers were even in the past timeline, so its feasibility is laughable.2. How is Thanos more powerful without the Infinity Gauntlet? Without the IG, Even out of shape Thor, with both Storm Breaker and Mjolnir should have been able to easily dispatch Thanos.3. Why did they have to take the gauntlet across the battlefield? Just a few moments earlier Dr Strange literally teleported a huge army onto the battlefield...why didn't he either bring the Pym van to them or the gauntlet to the van? Or transport both to a location far away from the battlefield so they could send the stones back in time? Maybe Dr. Strange should have gone to 14,000,606 futures.4. There just wasn't enough Pym Particles in Nebula's suit to transport ALL OF THANOS' army and ships. Plus every one of Thano's army would need a travel suit to survive the Quantum Realm...just saying.5. Captain Marvel IS NOT the most powerful MCU Avenger...she hasn't matured in her ""absence"" and thinks she will save the day...what ends up happening is she goes in single-minded and blinded by her arrogance...something that Thanos used to his advantage, pulled the power stone from the gauntlet and knocked her a cross the battlefield...Never to be seen again for the rest of the brief battle, leaving the victory to the true embodiment of the Six Infinity Stones: Tony Stark...because he IS Flawed, and he has made a LONG journey to his current maturity...he's even become a surrogate father to Peter Parker. So it was without surprise that Tony needed to make the ultimate sacrifice.Even with these glaring issue; if you don't think about the movie after you leave the theater, it's one of the best...a great example is the journey Thor has make, even with his opportunity to have a farewell talk with his mother.",positive
So so over hyped a bit above average but far too long. The hype here is real thank goodness I only paid $5. Wait for it come our on Firestick.,negative
"Thanks for with me in my best 11 years.
I love you 3000 times.
Simply the one best thing to live in Earth as Human.",positive
"This is it. Avengers: Endgame is the culmination of the greatest franchise in film history, the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Civil War divided the Avengers, Infinity War destroyed them, and Endgame is the incredible reunion and final assembling of Earth's mightiest heroes.Where Infinity War was large and loud, Endgame is intimate and quiet. The emotion that is felt during (and especially at the end of) Endgame is unlike any other emotion conveyed in cinema. These are real stakes for characters that you have come to know and love over the past decade. The balance of juggling complex story lines while still delving into individual character development is masterful. The selfish become selfless, the lost find home and the burdened can finally rest.When all is said and done, Avengers: Endgame is a masterclass of greatness.",positive
Captured some of the funniness of the first movie that made it so good and lost the balance in the Movies in between. The balance of action & comedy drama for me returned here is what's best about these films.,positive
"MARVELOUS
Nothing short of spectacular.
An ensemble of epic proportions.
A group of remarkable individuals: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Paul Rudd, Jeremy Renner, Brie Larson, Josh Brolin, Karen Gillian, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Russo Brothers, Kevin Feige and many many more have created the event of a generation that'll be forever celebrated in the halls of great cinema magic.",positive
"I really enjoyed this movie and would have given it a 10 out of 10 stars, but I gave it a 9 out of 10 due to the fact of them using Thor's gaining of weight as a comedy aspect, yes it was kind of funny but it also kind of made me feel bad about my own body.. I really did enjoy the movie for everything else though.",positive
This movie was the best avengers movie and I think it wrapped up the Captain America and iron man storyline very well. This movie was very emotional. The movie did not feel like 3 hours long it felt like a one hour movie . Overall great movie and great Characters really enjoyed it.,positive
"Such a disappointment. Avengers and GOTG upgraded the genre with their last movies. This is is a huge step back. Too long, I literally got bored in the middle. The story makes no sense, the end is predictable. Why kill the good Natasha instead of Hawkeye who was beyond redemption? Why put women on the side in general? I hate the sequence of women united, as if they are only worth it as a set (ticking the box for including women), not as individuals.
The only character that saved movie: The Hulk",positive
Great work from all actors .. alot of emotions we laughed alot and confused alot and finally we was very happy for this work thanks alot marvel,positive
"This movie was full of weird plot holes, or maybe I don't get it. Captain Marvel was great, could have had a bit more to do, but it was a fair amount... but it is still strange for me how she can bring a space ship across 1000 light years back to earth, but cannot beat Thanos in one to one combat - just strange. What I don't quite get is if Gamora's death was undone. Then yet, she has another Guardians movie to do, so I guess so. Appearance of one of the Russo brothers was cheesy. The best part was Thor, I loved his new reformed self in this one.",positive
"I realise that I'm in the minority, here, but I walked out of this...this thing really, really angry. Oh, it's a spectacle, to be sure, but an empty one. To each their own, and more power to you if you enjoyed the film, but I couldn't. Why? A number of reasons. It'll be wordy, but at least you can see why exactly I only gave it a three-star-rating - and this is coming from a person who mostly reviews things she loves.
Anyway, here goes.
First, characterisation. Oh, boy. Let's start with a spiteful nit-pick. Those kept piling up, which is why I mention it. The Asgardians. I have a question, writers: why are the Asgardians fishermen now? Seriously, what gives? Asgard was a highly developed society with technology so advanced, it looked like magic. They had Star-Trek-esque power shields. They had hovercraft. They are not fishermen. Is that because of Norway? Not everyone fishes there, either and also, Asgardians are not Norwegians. It's like if you live close to a river and you specialise in engineering energy shields, someone suddenly pushes you into a boat, and goes: ""Fish!!!!"" Sorry, but no.
Then, there's the real problem: Fat Bumbling Thor. What was that? No, seriously. What was that? That's not Thor. That drunken, stoned, lardy, snickering, obnoxious fool is not Thor. Remember the first movie? Where he was a bit of an impulsive, boisterous tool but still overall noble, courageous, selfless, and cultured? The Thor who created some situational comedy without turning into a pitiable punchline? That's Thor.
Character derailment for the sake of komedy is not funny, nor is it excusable. It's just bad writing. It's gimmicky and I hate it.
Don't even get me started on how Nebula kills her past self without consequences or how years of character development for Gamora get wiped away. Awesome, that. Top notch.
The other characters don't fare all that well, either. What was it with Tony suddenly being ""tired and finally ready to rest"" or whatever (paraphrasing, here)? Since when? And Steve staying in the past and playing houseboy whilst Hydra run rampant and his best buddy gets tortured is maybe the worst bit of pathetic ""happy ending"" I've ever come across with. That's not something he would do. If he had a shot at saving Bucky in the past, he would. He wouldn't be this selfish. I also wonder how exactly that worked in everyday life. What did he do all day? The dishes? Peggy's life would be drastically different with Steve around. None of the future events would have happened, and there is simply no handwaving this away or ignoring it. The reason I'm harping on all these details is that added together, they just don't make sense. Everything is just off, and we're supposed to just go along with it like it doesn't reek of sloppily put-together, bad fanfiction? No. No, thanks. I'll pass.
That's all bad enough, but then, the plot kicks in, and boy howdy, is it a doozy. Now, I realise that time travel stories need to be taken with a healthy heap of salt (pun unintentional but fitting), yes, but I guess it's the entire package that made me so mad. It's the cavalier attitude, the nonsense, the lack of intelligence, the lack of logic, and all the la-dee-dah accompanying it. First of all, there's the ""oh, it's not like in Terminator and Star Trek"". What is it like, then? If I travel into the past, it's my future? Okay, so riddle me this: if someone goes to the past and kills their past self, then they're still dead in the future and will, therefore, never travel into the past. That's a head-scratcher, but how does the movie deal with it? TERMINATOR WAS WRONG!!!!!! HEY, LOOK, SHINY CARKEYS!!!! That's pretty much it. It doesn't make sense on even the most basic level. Even on first viewing, when we're supposed to just cackle at Fat Bumbling Thor and gawp at the big explosions, the whole plot simply falls apart. Cause and effect are a thing. If someone cuts off my finger in 1999, I'll still be Frodo in 2019. You can't just go THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS, make a wannabe-snarky quip, and then movie on to the next hilarious hijinks. What outrageous thing will Fat Bumbling Thor do next? How much more amusing will this light-hearted version of the Hulk be (never mind how all his problems just got magically solved for the sake of hurr-hurr-funny).
And how exactly did Steve get the MacGuffins back to the exact same moment in time? That's just virtually impossible, because there were always people around. Take the glowstick of destiny, for instance. Hail Hydra? Okay, so that means that Winter Soldier etc. didn't happen. Nothing past those movies happened, because how - how - did Steve get that thing back without anyone seeing him? There were people around at all times (even Howard Stark in the 1970s). How did he get the ether back to Jane? Did he sneak up on her? Even if, she would have noticed, and that would have changed everything. What about Natasha? How did that pan out? The lol-I-kill-me-first scene, and then Steve shows up and it's all hunky-dory? Why is she still dead? If it never happened, then she shouldn't be dead. But I guess the movie told me her death is final, so it's all good. Tell me, movie, don't show. I don't need sense or logic. It was in the script, so it must be true. And what about Loki? Not only did he (as per the rules of the movie) create an alternate timeline by stealing the Tesseract, but he's gone now from the main one, isn't he? And none of these taking-away-bringing-back gigs affected the other events occurring simultaneously in the MCU timeline? How?
The scenes went on for too long, too, especially the ""comedic"" ones. The one relatively in the beginning, with Scott and Bruce and those kids...yikes. It went on forever. The joke wasn't that clever or amusing in the first place, and it overstayed its welcome like nobody's business. And they kept doing that over and over (o hai Fat Bumbling Thor).
Sigh.
The problem is that all these logic failings, the bad characterisation, and the shucks-ain't-we-clever-thinking-is-for-dopes instants pile up. The movie feels like a clip show: a bunch of komedy or action sketches sewn together, written by folks who think their audience has the attention span of a tomato. That's the worst part. The lack of effort to tell a coherent story. Oh, I'm sorry, was I supposed to feel sad when Tony bit it? Because I didn't care.
It just made me angry.
I'm only giving it three stars because the effects were shiny and it's not the actors' fault.",negative
The movie was awesome. The battle and sacrifices with the twists that I definitely didn't expect. By far it was amazing to watch.,positive
"Lived up to expectations. Every single minute of the movie had me wondering what was going to happen next. Enough movement in the storyline that it never was boring. But I will say, bring your tissues!!",positive
"Endgame is literally the best movie ever made! It exactly like the comics, have an amazing epic battle and ends with the sad death of Iron Man, but that doesn't mean that the franchise will end, the film also gives a lot of elements to give us sequels",positive

"I'm putting a 9 there because I know that my emotions got in the way of what would have been a critical viewing.No spoilers, so that takes away any explaining that might go into that, but know that if you have been following the films closely over the past decade or so, you will be feeling emotional by the end as well.The actors performed their roles well, the story is well written, there are some well-timed laughs stuck in the middle of what is an appropriately somber film. The writing is well done, the score is fantastic, everything that we've come to expect from Marvel films.The fact that it closes the Infinity Saga so well is what puts it head and shoulders above the others, I think.Would recommend to friends, and probably will be watching it again.",positive
"Good one! After one year's waiting, it has finally came out, great!",positive
"This was a great film, I'll admit in places it was dull and what is with the terrible names for all these avengers films, age of ultron isn't bad but man they make them sound so cheesey. Captain America often annoys the life out of me for being so proud but I actually quite enjoyed him in this. Thor was amazing, looked just like my farther in places with his one pack. Good acting, it was great how the merged all the films together like that and if I'm honest they should just leave it at this, DONT MAKE ANYMORE STUFF MARVEL STUDIOS !! It's had a great run and now it should just end. An okay end to some okay films. Now let it end. P.s they basically undid everything Thor ragnarok did, few Thor's hair back, gave him his hammer back and his eye. I mean, come on.",positive
"I have seen Avengers Endgame on 24 April 2019 in Cinema. You like Avengers Infinity War, then you will like Avengers Endgame too. This Movie is same good how Avengers Infinity War. In Avengers Endgame we have got a big great battle too. All in one is Endgame a GREAT Avengers movie and a MUST watch movie (in cinema).",positive
Good film. It could be great if there was not that much idiot jokes and that Thor was threared as non idiot. And everyone who says this is better than Nolan's trilogy is idiot. Anyone who says this is better than Man of steel or BvS or Watchmen is also an idiot.,positive
"I watch all films with an open mind and went into this 3 hour long film without any preconceptions.This film really let itself down. The writers completely changed some of the characters, they tried to make it funny and failed at every attempt where it was cringe worthy and boring. The story was dragged out to its limit and went on for way to long.Don't waste your money at the cinema, maybe Google the outcome.",negative
"Ten years the MCU has been with us, and through all these years I've been watching their films and grading them like a teacher grades homework. Sometimes too harshly maybe. Today I'll be at my most benevolent, so the rating might be somewhat biased.Let's be honest. All the previous MCU movies, except the Captain America ones, were inherently flawed (as Thanos would've said, those flaws were ""inevitable""). Not because of the writing or the visuals, but because of the heroes' nature. Only Steve Rogers was both mature and complete from within, so his story was always solid and compelling on all levels. All the other ""heroes"" were more or less kids in powersuits, fighting their own childhood traumas or searching for their purpose. And, as much as I love the coming-of-age movies, a certain annoying goofiness is always their prominent part.But not today. Thanos' Snap didn't just remove a half of the universe's population - it forced everyone to re-evaluate their whole modi operandi. When so many people just... vanish all of a sudden, you just can't stay the same, especially if you feel like it's in a way your fault.And this turn has given us the first hour of this film, maybe the deepest and the most sincere hour in the history of the superhero genre. The post-apocalyptic fright isn't anything new, but this time it's not about the actual survival, but rather trying to accept the new reality, in which, by some lucky coincidence, you were... allowed to live, while some people hadn't been.This, and the whole grandeur of the culmination, are the things that mark out Endgame as a masterpiece of its kind, which deserves to be remembered. The rest is a pretty typical Marvel'esque stuff, lots of pathos and bright CGI effects. Towards the end the movie becomes almost too sentimental, but I guess I would be too, if that universe became my second family for ten years.One more thing. I've been a part of the Team Cap since his first film, and I rooted for his side in Civil War. But this time Steve Rogers and Tony Stark managed to play it together and create a duo that truly shines. I guess when a story that big comes to an end, everyone has a chance to be a hero without overshadowing anyone else.",positive
Rating 10/10 Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie.,positive
"This movie gets nine and a half stars for anyone seeing all the mainstream Marvel films. It ties everything together so wonderfully. Such clever writing. Only a couple of small problems, clunkers added by Disney to sell their woke version of political correctness, but on every other level, extremely well done.",positive
"I watched it two times and it's still my fave in the MCU yet. Even though there's unexpectedly infrequent action, it still is an outstanding climax of an epic journey. I was slightly crying during the deaths, but whatevs. Definitely a A plus",positive
"What I have to admit and praise is the fact that this movie is really unpredictable.Everyone was thinking that the whole 3-hour-long plot will be focused on killing Thanos. And after 30 minutes you have him decapitated and you're thinking ""So
now what?"".That was the 1st Act's master move. You could empathize with the heroes who had their revenge and still nothing has changed. You could feel the void they feel. And you kept wondering what they are going to do now.So the 1st act was about grief and void.In the 2nd Act they start working with the time-machine. This part is very entertaining and nice. Although at first I felt it might be a little bit too complicated I think it's a very nice move to wrap up the whole story. You could see how the heroes has changed since then and feel some nostalgia.So the 2nd act is about memories, wrapping up the story and fun.And then comes the 3rd act - the final battle with Thanos and his army. And here's where Russo brothers made a stupid mistake. And as a consequence lost all the tension.What's the mistake about?In superheroes movies one of the most important thing is the characters' power level. You know that Black Widow is strong, Captain America is stronger, Hulk is even stronger and Thanos is even stronger than all of them combined. You have the hierarchy.It's very important since watching a fight between Black Widow and Thanos wouldn't give any suspense at all. You know their power levels, you know that Thanos is much stronger so you know the outcome of their fight. It's predictable.There are options to improve someone's power level. Iron Man gets better suits, Captain Marvel gets rid of the device that controls her, Thor gets a new axe and so on.What's exciting about Superhero movies is the fact that their Villains also gets stronger. In the 1st part they fought Loki. In the 2nd they fought Ultron. In the 3rd they fought Infinity-Gauntlet Thanos. And in the 4th...They fight Thanos and his army. More or less the same fight that they had in Wakanda. But there's one important difference. Thanos doesn't have the Infinity Gauntlet. So Endgame Thanos is much weaker than Infinity War Thanos. How much weaker? Maybe 2 maybe 5 maybe 10 times.Why it's that important?At the end of the Infinity War Thor arrives to Wakanda with Stormbreaker. He almost single-handedly destroys the whole Thanos' army, ships included. Then he wins with Infinity Gauntlet Thanos. Which means Infinity War's Thor is the most powerful creature in the Universe.He 'should've gone for the head' and he lets Thanos snap his fingers but the point has been made.Stormbreaker Thor > Infinity Gauntlet ThanosSo the Russo brothers went for making Thor weaker which was funny move. And it could be okay if they took into account that Endgame Thanos doesn't have the Gauntlet.So let's come back to the Endgame last fight.On the superheroes side:
You have out-of-shape but still Mjolnir-worthy Thor.
You have Captain Marvel.
You have Scarlett Witch.
You have Captain America with Mjolnir.
You have Dr Strange.And you have handful of other superheroes. And Wakanda's army.On the Villain's side:
You have Thanos without Infinity Gauntlet (like 2-5-10 times weaker than the one with a Gauntlet).
You have his disciples.
You have his army.It doesn't make sense on a Power Level dimension.As Thor has already defeated all the Villain's side with much stronger Thanos now it's obvious that they're going to win. Maybe he's out of shape and he lost like 50% of his power. But still he's stronger than the whole Villain's side combined.And he has Captain Marvel, Scarlett Witch, Captain America, Dr Stranger and all the other guys to help.So it's like watching Thanos vs. Black Widow. No tension at all.And that's why the last Act has been spoilt by a stupid mistake. Sorry to see that as I really wanted the most epic battle of the 22-movie series. What I had was a very predictable fight that has been somehow saved by an unpredictable ending with Tony Stark dying.What alternatives could we have?Just top of mind:1) Thanos gets the Gauntlet but doesn't snap his fingers. Due to the pride he decides to face the Avengers using the Infinity Stones like a badass.It would be a really entertaining fight with Thanos changing time, moving to portals, using power stone etc. Killing some of the heroes would also add more emotions to that.And we can really see what the whole series was about - the Stones. Stones which makes you superior to any superhero.Especially if we take into account the fact that Thanos is supersmart. He may not win with the Stormbreaker Thor but he can definitely outsmart him and the other Avengers in a fight.Apart from the one Avenger. Tony Stark. So the whole ending would be a 'who is smarter' battle between him and Tony Stark. And then Stark somehow gets the Gauntlet and snaps the fingers.2) Thanos gets the Gauntlet and gives the Avengers the tough choice.He throws a big rock on New York City (to wrap the story up). And now the Avengers have to decide - do we fight with Thanos or do we help innocent people survive?So they are about to go help the New Yorkers but Dr Strange stops them. He says ""You can't go. We have only one chance. And we have to do it together. Whatever it takes."".How much better it would be? A lot. Even better than the Infinity War which I consider the best action-movie ever made.",positive
It was an amazing culmination for the first phases of the MCU.,positive
"Yay! This ends the marvel movie franchise! What? It's doesn't. Ugh. Oh well, at least this wraps up a lot, ends the major villain plot, has a few laughs, and gives everyone a moment to shine. Sure it has a million logic and continuity flaws, but who cares when you're breezing through so fast. Doesn't feel like three hours and well worth watching. That said, I never want to see another marvel movie let alone re-watch one.",positive

"Infinity War is just too big of a movie to overcome & Endgame suffers from trying to do it. The pacing was bad. Some characters are misrepresented & their arcs are ruined by doing so.

"""Yeah I guess you are right : This movie is a total mess with complete insignificant plot. I don't know what happened in the Russo's head while making the scenario. They must have hung their ideas with something like : We must satisfy our fans and give'em everything they've ever dream to see in a super-hero movie. Such an idiot way to think huuh? Seriously this movie sucks, with no emotion, no value. Everyone who liked this movie are complete idiots and should calm down.

My other reason is because they killed off my favourite character and i would of preferred they lived 😢",positive
"This perfectly ties the entire Avengers ""series"" together, with an ending that left me sad but content. Marvel does INCREDIBLE with every movie but this one hit different. If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest refreshing yourself with some past movies, obviously there are a ton of references and ties from the entire story.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and so on.Avengers 3 ended with Thanos carrying out the Snap and wiping out half of all life across the universe, including certain prominent Marvel heroes who fans already know must return in some form for their own movies. Most notable among these is Spider-Man, who plucked heartstrings with a tearful farewell in Tony Stark's arms, yet will swoop back onto screen in July for Spider-Man Far From Home.Fellow original, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, has another spectacular reinvention whch the actor and audience alike revel in, while Mark Ruffalo's Hulk/Banner dilemma gets the resolution hinted so heavily in the early posters. There is enormous joy being had in subverting both characters yet again and the humour is irresistible. I'm just not entirely sure it helped an already overloaded film find its tone or pacing.It is a great movie, highly enjoyable and does a remarkable job servicing the entire array Marvel movies that have come before. If sometimes it feels a little self-indulgent and self-revereantial, that is understandable and forgivable. I just wish it had been a tiny bit bolder and more brutal in its choices.",positive
"Lots of creepy characters, lots of meaningless action scenes, a vast number of superheroes (None having any purpose whatsoever) together make this extravaganza of buffoonery which had the world dancing to its tune. Thank God the franchise is over, or else we would have to bear the pain of people going crazy and wasting hours over discussing the piece of c.. that it was. Iron Man dying in the end looked ludicrous. Really feeling like my time, money and energy have been robbed by the makers. Hollywood please make more meaningful movies. We know you are capable of doing that.",positive
"This movie took my expectations and shattered them. I was stuck glued to the theater screen for all 3 hours not wanting to look away or blink. The perfect blend of humor, action, and emotionally powerful scenes. At first I was finding to tough to believe they would be able to surpass the events of Infinity War, but I knew the Russo Brothers and great team behind this movie were gonna be able to pull it off. And they did just that. The hour of the movie left me with tears of joy and tears of sadness at the time. By the time I was leaving the movie theater my eyes were and stingy due to the amount of tears I had cried. As someone who has been watching MCU movies since the very beginning and seen every single one this move was true worth the 10+ year wait. Could not be happier.",positive
"Usually i don't have an habit to review each movie as it comes out but finds myself writing this review as i was so hyped for this movie.The directors was so focused about the proper send off ROBERT DOWNY JR that they literally ignored the mistakes that they committed in the movie.Real Question is that in order to win it was really required iron man to sacrifice himself ?
he was in possession of all infinity stones,instead of snapping he can really use the REALITY STONE to make a joke out of thanos and his army.
also the directors Treatment for character like HULK and Thor was so disappointed specially HULK ""WE LITERALLY DESERVE THANOS VS HULK REMATCH"".
Also at various moments there is a small pause is required so that the importance of that moment can be shown but it was missing eg CAPTAIN holding Hammer should be given some time so that it would felt like something big has happened.
and lets not even talk about the messy time travel and that captain growing old part.
All in all really disappointed with the movie and literally not worth all the hype it is getting.",positive
"I really liked Infinity war,but endgame is so much boring.
Thor and Hulk were totally wasted.Average CGI and actions.Some dialogues felt forced and totally
unnecessary.I expected more from marvel.
The Infinity war ending was much better and epic.I will take endgame as an alternate ending",negative
"This is a great film, although it's slow start, it does make up for it towards the rest of the film. Truly recommended for those marvel fanatics.",positive
"I remember when i watched for the first time this move ,i was so upset after seeing the fat Thor and i considered this movie to be one of the worst movies ever,but last night i saw the movie again (i really don't like the Avengers series,excepting Infinity War ,although i like MCU as a whole ) and suddenly i realised this movie is as good as Spiderman Far From Home .This is really a great movie , hmmm !",positive
"With a perfect respect to both death and life, Endgame lived up to the definition of closure. The intricate plot takes you through laughter and tears, joy and grief, anticipation and thrill. The cast and the crew did an incredible job in pulling off the task set before them.",positive
"I'm not sure what the fascination is with people who desire to be so 'edgy' that they can shave their face with their bare hands...but looking at some of the 1/10 reviews here, it's a common fascination.Some have fixated on 'plot holes' as a result of the time travel elements of the movie...its TIME TRAVEL. It's literally impossible to make a movie containing that topic and not be left with questions, since you can always interpret cause and effect/paradox elements of a time travel movie.This film is actually peak marvel perfection. I review a film on how well it keeps me enthralled by asking myself how many times I thought about having a cigarette during a movie.Now I rarely actually leave for one but if I'm thinking about it, im not fully engrossed.Endgame made me forget I even smoked for its entire 3hr runtime (the added runtime making it even more challenging to acchieve). I cant possibly rate higher.When I finally got outside I would describe the cigarette I had as less the feeding of a habit; and more as post coital.Even as the darker film of the franchise they still bring some humor and avoid going full 'DC Dark'; and you still genuinely root for the characters, terrified for their possible fates.The third act is nothing short of absolutely epic and my advice would be to be mindful of your surroundings...as the person next to you is at risk of damage on the several occasions where you can (and will) punch the air.And if you dont have tears in your eyes towards the end, then you are the person the snap deserved to get.The Russo's have done it again. You pair of geniuses!!!",positive
"When I was a kid(I was 12),I remember when I watched Iron Man for first time and I didn't know that is the start of MCU. Then,3 years later I find out whats going on. I can't belive It is over now. Tony Stark was a hero in every movie,he always have to do ""the right thing"". In the New York he was who risk it all,and then in Infinity war he goes to space to protect the world. He is TRULY HERO of the MCU! It is so sad beacause he left his beloved wife and daughter behind to save the universe. I am sad beacuse he is gone(small part of me hope he will come back from past and live his life with family) but that is the way it had to be. I am also happy on the second hand that he was willing to die for everbody. It stared with "" I am ironman"" and that is how it end. Every journery has an end. Thank you Marvel Studio, it was beautiful journery,I can't wait to watch it one day with my children.
I don't want to make other characthers less worthy,I think they all was amazing but I want to give this honour to Tony.
Enjoy the movie guys 🌌",positive
"Wow .. ok the story is straight forward ,yes sometimes too much to process and if u think about it you might find flows but the main thing that made that movie great is just how easily it makes you fell every emotion the scene wants you to feel , you want to cry you will cry or at least feel terribly sad u want to laugh , be exited you will 100% . Also the amount of references is a a lot .
Honestly I don't think they (MCU) can top that at least on the emotional scale .",positive
"So yeah Endgame happened. Definitely an enjoyable movie with a lot of fan service, but did it live up to the hype? Did it finalize an era of epic proportions? Was it the best MCU movie of all time? In my opinion - no. Before digging into the negative, let's take a look at the positive. It was an enjoyable movie with great fan service and call backs. Cap whispering ""Hail Hydra"" in an ear while on an elevator with the same people from Cap 2. Cap wielding both Thor hammers and using them in conjunction with his shield. Let's not forget at the end getting to see old man Rogers. Endgame hits you in the emotions right at the beginning by killing off Clint's family, but then turns him into a badass ninja. That epic Easter egg of Harley at Stark's funeral. Hopefully now people will respect Iron Man 3 a little more (still the best of the Iron Man series). For the most part any comic fan knows going into this movie that everything will end with everything back to normal and that is somewhat the case. Now I'm going to dip into some negative. A rat pretty much saved everyone. If not for that rat Scott would still be in the quantum realm. Yeah you could say Tony was working on time travel already too, but was he really? Time travel is a double edge sword. On 1 hand it's cool and can open doors for all kinds of cool things to happen, but at the same time it's a cop out. Now any time something bad happens and creators paint themselves into a corner they can just go back in time. Not only is it an easy way out, but it creates a lot of questions and plot holes (Where is Vision?!?!?!). What really doesn't help is when creators try to go and explain it after to fans and contradict themselves in the process - just don't explain it. Also now Hulk has permanent damage? Hello he heals and what hurts him makes him stronger. I also didn't like pausing the movie and forcing that feminism moment in the middle of a fight. It was forced and really on the nose. Once again the MCU has killed off a good villain and a major character. Don't worry I know as a comic reader nobody stays dead (plus we never saw Stark's body go in the ground). I get these actors want to move on to other things, but don't kill them off. I mean why couldn't you just let Tony have a win. He was finally happen. Let the character take a break and if RDJ doesn't want to come back later, recast the character. Think of it as an artist change on a comic book. Of course the idea of Harley taking the Iron Man mantle does have me intrigued. Dipping back into some positive. I loved how the Hulk was done in this and want more smart hulk. Fat Thor was hilarious and well done. It was nice to see Thor get his hammer back too and him getting to talk to his mom again. The scenes with Tony and his dad were great. Steve getting to go back and get his dance with Peggy. The Avengers 1 scenes and now Loki is alive? With the conclusion of this movie we have 5 dead characters - Thanos, Vision, Black Widow, Gamora (not same Gamora is back), and Iron Man (I love you 3000). This movie seems to have raised more questions bs solved/answered them, but maybe that was the plan as we move into phase 4.",positive
"We've spent 11 years waiting for this peak 3 hours. Thank you Marvel. It was the most ""everything"" I've ever seen.",positive
"I used to hail this film as some sort of masterpiece for months, and then every time I rewatched it I just started to like it less. To Endgame's credit, it wraps up a lot of things beautifully and has some genuinely tear-jerking scenes. Tony, Steve, Natasha and Clint had their arcs wrapped up fantastically (even if Steve has a bit of a grey area relating to another 100 year old man he said he'd be with ""until the end of the line"") and the CGI is obviously top tier. Coupled with an absolutely incredible third act that is paced perfectly, filled with some of the best delivered fan service I have ever seen and has one of the most epic, emotionally powerful scenes that I have ever seen from any film, and it always gives me goosebumps.But when you take away that third act as well as the payoffs that were executed well, Endgame starts to fall apart quickly. Thor and Hulk had genuinely awful conclusions to their character arcs. Thor's one is definitely the most divisive among fans and I definitely see what they tried to do and it certainly made sense considering the narrative, but the way it was executed just didn't work. Hulk on the other hand was just straight up confusing, with his entire arc that was built up through Infinity War being solved OFF SCREEN and then not having him do anything for a good chunk of the movie. Not only that but the movie is a complete mishmash of tones. It's argued that Infinity War also had this problem to some extent, but it was able to actually balance those tones well considering the movie's structure and pacing. In Endgame, the emotional scenes and the comedy scenes are too close together and don't get enough time to breathe. I know it might be too much to ask a three hour movie to take a little more time with its pacing, but the second act of this film is an utter mess. Granted, some of the emotional scenes do work and the jokes aren't half bad (unless they involve Thor), but they are placed so sporadically that it just comes off as distracting. THEN there's the whole time travel fiasco. The time travel in Endgame, when explained, does genuinely make sense, it's just that when they try to incorporate the Infinity Stones into the time travel as if they control the flow of time then the movie collapses. It completely contradicts what we've been led to believe about the time travel that they're trying to do and generally doesn't make any sense. If they're simply going to an alternate timeline that's in the past, then what part do the Infinity Stones actually play in that? I get changing stuff will create another timeline, but the Infinity Stones creating the flow of time doesn't make a lick of sense at all. And everyone's made a load of memes about it already, but the rat being the thing to kickstart the movie is impossibly contrived and dumb, regardless of Doctor Strange's plan. I don't wanna put a spoiler warning on this review so I won't explain the exact details, but it really is ridiculous.Other than the second act of the film throwing a wrench in the entire product, the first act is really well done, if just a tad boring at times. It has a consistent tone, balances the comedy and drama relatively well, basically does everything that the second act should've. Even with all of the time travel stuff, Endgame would be a whole lot better if the second act was actually cohesive and had a good balance of tones.Overall, is Endgame a decent film? I'd say yes, and a satisfying one at that. But is it good? Hard question, because the film is technically well made and has a good first and third act, it's just that the third act takes up so much of the movie and puts so many holes and issues into the whole product. Is it as good as Infinity War? HELL no. Infinity War is still a fantastic film that does everything this movie did but correctly (minus the time travel of course). It is a shame to see the final chapter of the MCU almost go down in flames and to only be saved by a competently done third act, but I guess the Russo's just got a bit carried away when trying to wrap things up.",positive

"I have stayed away from the internet so that I didn't get to find out any of the storyline and spoil watching the film.
This film had a tough act to follow but overall I think it did. My only criticism is that it maybe tried to be too funny at times, Infinity war was a much darker film. You can't please everyone and some of the really low ratings and bad reviews on here are ridiculous, some people need to get a grip.

"I love this movie not just because there are fan service moments, but the writing is woven together from previous Marvel films and this phase of the MCU culminates in grand style. The fan moments are justified then, because of the writing and the story offers balance. There is no shortage of humor, as you would expect; It has become a stapel to have in a Marvel movie. I can connect with the characters (protaganists) who after losing to Thanos in Infinty War must accept that defeat and move on with that sour taste still in their mouths. This is something most of us have more than likely had to deal with at one point or another in their lives: Defeat and how to pick ourselves up after losing. People can say what they want about the different issues and ""plotholes"" but honestly, ""Avengers Endgame"" closes out this phase in the MCU in such an epic way.. It'll be interesting to see how they should attempt to top this!",positive
"The very best of Marvel, without the cheap filler. Endgame is a near perfection. It's an emotional journey, the culmination of 20 other marvel films. It's hard to understand how the Russo brothers got this oh, so right.Gone is the awful comedy from Captain Marvel, none of the boedom from Ant-man and the Wasp. What we get here, to quote Thanos from Infinity War, is ""perfect balance"". There is still humour, but it's generally very well placed.It really is the very best of Marvel. There are the awesome set pieces we first saw in Thor: Ragnarok, there's all the fan service you can ask for, but I can't say much more without spoiling the film.Even as somewhat of a Marvel skeptic, I really enjoyed Endgame. Even if it does have a few faults. There were a couple of moments that seemed slightly dull. But they were as I say 'moments', remarkable for a 3 hour film. It definitely didn't outstay it's welcome. I wanted more at the end, but I still felt satisfied.There were a few long overdue scenes. I particularly enjoyed the moments of service to the female characters of the MCU. They have been well overdue, especially considering characters such as Black Widow, have never had their own feature film, yet still arguably is one of the most badass, pulling some of the wildest fight moves. But it wasn't in your face, it was well placed.The film wraps up wonderfully, a real powerful conclusion. And I refuse to say any more. I wish I could argue the finer points of this wonderful film, but I won't spoil it.Go and see it, and if you can manage to push yourself through Ant-Man and the Wasp, watch that, then infinity war, first. I wouldn't bother watching Captain Marvel first if you haven't seen it, it's completely unnecessary, and by far the worst marvel movie in years.Anyway, go and enjoy this wonderful film. Have fun!",positive
"It is absolutely the best....I can say without doubt...there are many movies in the universe...but endgame is one in a billion....action packed,emotional ... good story...full of humour. There's nothing like it",positive
A film to make it unpredictable should not be sacrificed like this. should not be watched with great expectation. I am very sad.,positive
"Best endgame for The 10 years, you won't believe your own eyes and it's surpass of all the expectation.Part of journey is the end.""I am Iron Man""

"The special effects are top notch, but the film is very bloated at 3 hours when its a simple tale of a cop out time travel ending. There exists a ""De-Feminized Fanedit"" that proves the point, at a little less than half the length it tells the same story in tighter and frankly more effective form. No random appearance of immersion breaking over powered mary sues and the rest, just a slog fight of actual avengers and superheros working together for a single goal because it's necessary, and not because some over powered character feels some kind of sick amusement at watching everyone else do most of the work.
What could have been a perfect two part send off is marred by this modern faddish politics being inserted into all entertainment to its detriment, hopefully this will all soon pass and simply will be remembered as a strange marker of its times.",positive
"What the?......how could i have enjoyed Infinity war so much and find this to be a bunch of total incoherent crap? leave the Time Traveling to the experts like Dr Who. I wont even go into the all the plot holes and no sense paradoxes as i'm sure many have already done but what a sad ending to a wonderful journey? and please Disney, please lay off on the Wokey preaching crap its getting tedious, lets just have a good story eh and leave the politics to the Politicians?",negative
"Movie throughout was a bunch of thrill... Every 10 min from starting have something new.... Though I won't spoil anything.. Thus didn't like Thor's condition... And yes movie has a quite emotional ending... Have been watching all movie. Since 2008.. it was heartaching.. that my childhood favorite characters... Will not be there on screen... No Thor, no cap, no iron man, no black widow, no Hulk ..... Very emotional moment for me.. But hats off to everyone...",positive
I love this movie so much... and i want them to establish a new film and dont stop,positive
"So, Shell wouldn't go to the cinema to sit through a three-hour Marvel film, especially after Infinity War felt a bit lacklustre for me and she just right out disliked it. So, I waited for it to come out on Blu-Ray. And as I am a self-confessed geek and huge Marvel fan, this was tricky, not only that but I managed to avoid the majority of spoilers, though not only, but I'm alright with that as knowing what is going to happen in a film doesn't bother me as I enjoy it moment from moment.Overall, I enjoyed it, the first two hours did drag in places and could have been condensed into an hour, but the final hour was absolutely brilliant, from the moment I heard 'On your left' I couldn't stop smiling. The final hour was Marvel at it's best, every character had their little moment in the spotlight and with a cast so huge that was no mean feat. Full of action, humour and shocks. And this is a film for the original Avengers, they were the stars, the majority of other Marvel actors/actresses got a very easy pay check, I finally figured out why Gwyneth Paltrow did not realise Sebastian Stan was in the same film as her!Well, I am not going to go into the story here, as the majority of people who take the time to read this have already seen it and those who haven't are probably like Shell and just do not care! But I did want to think about some of the characters journeys.Captain America, Chris Evans turned out to be the perfect choice for this role, a role that could have ended up twee and self-righteous and overly patriotic was played with a gentle humour and sense of kindness, honesty and questioning, he was the leader you wanted to follow. Robert Downey Jr is undoubtably the only person you can see as Iron Man now, it is a character I have never really liked because of his arrogance but whilst that is certainly there so is his humanity and he has turned someone who was written to be sometimes unlikable into a role model for the new generation of Marvel fans. Chris Hemsworth Thor again could have been a stereotypical powerful God who destroys everything, but the humour he has as well as the self-deprecating nature of Mr Hemsworth is superb, Thor Ragnarök is truly a marvellous Action Comedy and his turn in this film had a desperation to it as well as being bliming funny. Mark Ruffalo stopped the curse of the Hulk actors and proved you can play both Bruce and Hulk, though the character design was bit odd in this one. Scarlett Johansson had the most difficult job of bringing what could've been a one-dimensional assassin to life and she turned her into a leader and gave her layers that sometimes the comic book character lacked. Though she was sometimes over-powered in the humour stakes by the others! And finally , from the main characters, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, a human firing arrows, surrounded by Gods and Aliens, personally I loved his take on the character, you could believe that he could sit side by side with these legends and earn their respect, plus he had some awesome one-liners throughout the films. Also, big hand to Don Cheadle for actually getting to do something this movie, War Machine stepped up! So did Karen Gillan as Nebula, so glad to see where she will be appearing next. And Brie Turner continues to show what a superb character Captain Marvel can be in the right hands.Now, I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with Wanda and Vision and how? Also are The Falcon and Winter Soldier going to be a double act to follow Riggs and Murtaugh or will they be more PInky and the Brain. What is the storyline of Black Widow going to be? As well as follow ups for Black Panther, Doctor Strange and now Spiderman (well done Sony and Marvel execs). Is the new generation going to lead Marvel into the 20's with style, like a modern-day Charleston! Looking forward to the next Roaring Twenties!What was a very good three-hour film could've been an awesome 2 and bit hour film. But that's just being picky as it was a great ending to this stage of the Marvel story and to various characters storylines and the beginning of the next phase and other characters taking centre stage (a whole lot of spoilers avoided here!). And just like everyone else I googled who the lad was at the end. The whole thing gets a 15/20 for me but that final hour a 20/20.",positive
"The MCU was something we shared from its start with Iron Man back when he was 8. He loved the Sam Raimi (sp?) Spider-Man movies as well, so you can imagine how excited he was when he heard about that character's reboot. I am so thankful to Marvel. They gave my son an epic story of heroism, friendship, sacrifice, and purpose. I got to revisit my childhood on the big screen in a way I never dreamed possible.",positive
"The movie is
One of the best movies that I ever watched it was to emotional and too exiting f... I cried 3 times at it the twist was very good and a very amazing directors and for real thank you Russo brothers and thank you Stan Lee for this masterpiece and may you rest in peace Stan",positive
"It's just great, I don't want to spoil anything, just trust me. But to make it even better, watch the first iron man and captain America: the first avenger again if you already have or for the first time (and obviously you have to have seen infinity war, but you don't need to rewatch it if you have already seen it)",positive
"Big Marvel fan!! Wanted to get that out of the way before I start!Its just that the way Infinity war was directed and handled overall, Endgame had to up its game and thats where it fell a bit short, I feel. I knew time travel was always in play(so its not even a spoiler); however the direction, screenplay and science of time travel part was weakly handled. I am a huge time travel concept fan(Primer and Time crimes being the best). With the slow pace in the 1st act establishing the foundation for the rest of the movie, I thought they would do justice to the science, implication and the wit of time travel. So I expected a mature take on it. Three things could have been better to complete the time travel ark:-
1. The ripples it created in the alternate timeline were spoken of but not addressed at all when things started to go south in the original timeline.
2. Smart inserts of how original movies had certain scenes which were inexplicible then could have been attributed to this movie's time travel plot. Eg. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the russtle of leaves heard by Hermoine initially was understood when the time travel ark started. Something like that would have made a true Marvel fan giggle with delight. Missed a trick there.
3. Hulk explained that putting the stones back in its place will kill the offshoot timelines - meaning it could possibly invalidate the movie's timeline too!! But that was not addressed; am sure story writers had thought this through, just couldnt translate that in the screenplay.Its best moments can be summarized under 2 points:-
1. Humor (not top grade...nonethess prevalent throughout the movie)
2. NostalgiaBest handled characters in following order:-
1. Iron Man
2. Captain America
3. Thor
4. Hulk
5. Hawkeye andRaw deal for characters which were seemingly important for Phase 4 of MCU
1. Captain Marvel
2. Black Widow and Thanos
2. Dr. Strange
3. Spiderman
4. Black Panther
5. Vision (no screen time??! Unless you consider Howard Stark's driver Jarvis's voice)Although, I seem to be cynical rather than delighted fan with this review, overall I enjoyed the movie; worth a re-watch to catch the missed 1 one liners :)And if someone at Marvel is looking for Ideas to cash-in on nostalgia, Captain America's final scene can be a movie in itself(and hopefully someone will consider in future)!!!Good Luck Marvel...for Phase 4!...Looking forward to!",positive
"There were elements where this film moved a bit slower than it maybe should have, but in a way, it helped you take a deep breath before you headed into the storm that was the final few scenes. I laughed, I cried, and then I cried some more before saying goodbye to some of the characters who had been with me for over ten years. All I can say is thank you to these wonderful movies for being everything they were and everything they will always be.",positive
Beginning of endgame was strong but then everything fell apart. Way too much talking with too little action until the final hour - after infinity war ending I was expecting more. Time travel is such a lazy and annoying cliche. Agh.The final fight in endgame was incredible though. As a package endgame is an alright movie but infinity war was better,positive
Love most of the marvel movies so far (except captain marvel) but this was a total let down :(,negative

I liked the movie a lot. Surely it is a sequel to (Avengers: Infinity War) where it is a single long film. The battle where Thanos was killed was fantastic. I am very sad on Tony Stark but I am proud that his end was worth.,positive
I dan't believe this only has an average rating of 8.8. Probably the best movie in it's genre.,positive

"Infinity was was better than end game.
what you have done with thor is not good",positive
The movie is good. I think Disney gets that fans felt that Captain Marvel is an intruder within the series. Iron Man and Captain America lead the show with class and good dialog. Nebula steals the film in my estimation. There's a little pandering towards an all female avengers film but it doesn't hurt the film in general. So why 7? I didn't like the treatment they gave to Thor. I think that was lazy writing.,positive
"Left me shocked despite the theories building up to the film. I'm mentally exhausted from watching it but my god, they definitely end on a high! I couldn't have asked for a better ending.",positive
"A movie made for Disney (The Studio) and not for the fans!Filled with politically motivated scenes and themes of diversity that
didn't need to be.... Heroes torn down and completely dismantled specifically
Thor and The Hulk who most Marvel Comic fans will barely recognize. With Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr.'s contracts and desire to play their characters expiring this story line was forced to say good bye.It actually started promising enough picking up immediately where IW left off but then got side tracked and mired in too much nostalgia burdened with an homage to 10 years of Marvel Movies making the story disjointed and prolonged.Tony Stark's funeral was the burial of this Franchise, Stan Lee and Marvel movies. R.I.P. Marvel 2019!",positive
"3hrs of zooming around jumping through time, with stops for flat emotional diatribes . Then an end battle where the actors who are retiring were given a story exit. Blah blah. At least 'infinity war' had more laughs and a few nerdgasm scenes like Thor arriving in wakanda. End game looks and feels like a money extraction excercise . Perhaps they should have made this into a trilogy with part one thanos winning (2hrs), part 2 all about the emotional distress and how messed up things are (2hrs), then part 3 how they sort stuff out (2hrs). A bit like the first star wars trilogy . Overall meh",negative
"Its sad to see it come to an end. But im satisfied by how it ended and how the story went through.
With the usual expected sense of humor in marvels movies and a good story line.",positive
"As someone who spent almost every waking moment leading up to this movie theorizing, rewatching past movies, and talking with others about anything Marvel. I was satisfied. I found every character arc to be fulfilled except possibly Widow, but with a solo movie to come I hope that will be wrapped up nicely. Overall, this movie moved me and brought me an immense amount of closure. Look forward to the future",positive
Avengers Endgame is the best by far. All Marvels Cinematic Universe movies come together beautifully.,positive
Amazing movie 10/10 would watch again ending was sad tho,positive
"Better than infinity war. Ending is very emotional, and is very shocking. Wow, just Wow.",positive
This movie did everything great. There were some brilliant moments where I got Return Of The King vibes and I was pumped out of my mind. They really surprised me with how they chose to play this one out and all I can say is the Russos pulled it off amazingly. Also the soundtrack was incredible with a spectacular final act.,positive
"As a big Marvel & huge MCU fan, I had rather big expectations going into this one, as it was to be a culmination of 10 years and 20 movies, all of which I watched and debated vigorously (and rather obnoxiously) with friends willing and less so. Infinity war got me hyped and I even sat through the obnoxious Captain Marvel, in the meantime watching at least 5 hours of YouTube videos with predictions, trailer easter eggs, theories, etc. Then I heard the amazing hype, everyone loved it and even non-fans praised it.
However, after finally sitting down to watch it, I am sad to say I was left disappointed.Now don't get me wrong, it's a good movie. Fairly epic, adequately filmed, good action set-pieces & emotional moments, good acting, great script and an adequate story premise.
The only technical fault I have with it is the pacing, as this epic does drag quite often during the 3 hour runtime, and the opening 20minutes are especially annoyingly slow, with the odd choice of focusing on Hawkeye leaving me especially confused, as he is neither a character the audience cares for or is he very relevant in this movie.The story is also a bit thin, the whole time travel logic isn't very well thought through and the fact that everyone just appears acter disappearing for 5 years is not just disappointing but also sounds like a certain kind of horror for the survivors...But what I was missing most was emotion. It all feels rehashed, another typical superhero flick with a very predictable story and conclusion. Where infinity war's ending shocked, this leaves you feeling a resounding ""meh"". And for a movie dealing with half the population disappearing and with the send off of a few iconic characters, it's very worrying.",positive
3 hours went by in a flash! What an epic film. Hope it breaks all box office records and please let it be the first superhero movie to win an Oscar. It deserves it!,positive
"After 2 days I've changed my rating from an 8 to a 6. When I reflect back on it, there were only 3 good scenes in the entire movie: Black Widow's death, Tony Shark's death, and Cap dancing with Peggy. First 2 hours were boring. Battle scene good but not spectacular. But I did like those 3 scenes!!!!",positive
"WITHOUT TIME TRAVEL!1. Thanos does not destroy the gauntlet and Thanos does not die immediately at the beginning.2. Redeeming the hate for Captain Marvel: I personally like her character. I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie. That being said they should have brought her in, had character development with the remaining Avengers team, and got to the task of taking on Thanos and reversing what had happened in Infinity War. It could turn out that her power doesn't exceed but matches Thanos' power. Another possibility is that Thanos who finally has all of the Infinity Stones learns of yet more power that the Gauntlet unleashes. So many possibilities really they never even delved into the Gauntlet and what all it could do.3. That being said they could have tackled it numerous ways without the use of time travel, i will put one scenario out there. With the added power that Captain Marvel brings to the team they could take on Thanos, somehow acquire the Time Stone from the Gauntlet and use that to reverse time. Hell they could even have a huge CGI blowout where time is traveling backwards while they are fighting the mighty Thanos. Time reverses until they get back to the point where Infinity War left off. With all Marvel characters present they could have the biggest battle scene a Marvel movie has had to date. One where they tie up the contract issues with the actors and the ones that have to die could have died during the battle. So many variations they could have gone with and made it a much more edge-of-your-seat ride than what they put out, which was mostly boring, filled with plots holes and left me underwhelmed to say the least. I have no plans to re-watch Endgame in the near future, if at all.In conclusion i just wrote this in five minutes on a lazy Sunday afternoon after a week of brooding about how bad Endgame was. Marvel had an entire team of hundreds, probably thousands of people to put out a better product than what we got. It was a cop out film and everyone involved should be embarassed that that was the final product after so many years of building this exciting franchise.",negative
"The movie is very, very, very wonderful, and the end is cooler when Iron Man killed Thanos, but Iron Man died, Captain America has grown old, Thor is no longer a graceful body, and the fighting girl has died, except that there is a transformation in the heroes and new generations will come.",positive

"Avengers: Endgame is one of those movies that has so many references to other movies, so if you haven't watched the movies' for the main actors like ant-man, black widow etc. It is highly recommended for a great viewer experience.I'm one of those that rewatch movies if they're that good. I've rewatched Endgame 4 times. Such a great movie. I recently watched Black Widow, so I'm sure I'll grab a few more references from that movie.Even though its a great movie, I'm very sad that Tony Stark died. I almost cried during that scene in the movie the first time. After a quick google search, it turns out Marvel didn't want RDJ in the role as Tony Stark, after the last Avengers movie they thought he'd been overused in the role as Tony Stark.Either way, great movie! 9/10 from me. -1 star because of Tony Stark's death.",positive
"The film claimed to be super duper buster blockbuster hit after the movie Infinity War, and kept that promise also.
Some Critics and Peoples said that the Movie is Overrated, but I can say clearly that they will definitely be DCEU fans who are saying like that for Endgame. They are just trying to undercast the grossing collection of worldwide.
Anyway, The movie is for those people who saw MCU last 22 films and awaited for the conclusion as the twist was Thanos in their every movie.

it still have the same rhythm as infinity war. you get sad and happy, cry and laugh in a complete package and in a really fast moving. God you're not gonna ready for this.
A bunch of messages, so remember to focus on every frame if you look close enough you'll noticed this kind of thing.

"You know, it still amazes me how people consider Endgame a inferior sequel to Infinity War or even go as far as to say it was a bad movie. Most of their criticism is in connection with Endgame's version of Thanos as a villain. Needless to say I'm gonna be spoiling the movie from now on, so you've been warned. I'll be tackling some of the criticism I've heard regarding the movie and his villain. So, let us begin shall we!1. Thanos being passive in Endgame: I find it a bit funny for people to say that Thanos has always been an 'active character' when for the past 10 + years of films he's been sitting on a floating throne allowing others to do his work for him. It was only until Infinity war when he HAD to step in and even then he still sent most of his minions to do the work. If 'Squidward' had gotten the necklace off of Strange we would have never had the fight on Titan, if the Avenger's hadn't shown up at the train station Midnight would have gotten Vision and the mind stone. Most of the gems he had to get were because his minions failed him and he HAD to act, thus making him a mostly passive character waiting for others to do his dirty work and only resorting to doing it when his servants failed him.2. Saying that Thanos irradicating the universe and then rebuild it isn't something the real Thanos would do is, in my opinion, a poor critique. The reason this younger Thanos is prepared to wipe out the whole universe and start again is that the OG Thanos did that already and the younger one sees how it has brought him to the current predicament he is in right now. I think it would be very confusing if the past Thanos merely was like, ""When I get the Gauntlet, I'll do the exact same thing that my future self will do!"" He saw that his plan left those who would want to revert his actions, so why not clear the board and start from scratch?
You might also bring up that Thanos never got any development in Endgame but he doesn't have to, this is the same Thanos we saw in Infinity War but REacting to the Avenger's plans instead of acting as he did before. He had the ball in his court during IW, he had a response for everything and was ready to plow through them all, whereas in Endgame he knew nothing about it and had to react to what they were planning on doing. This is still the Thanos we knew in IW but younger and reacting to a whole new set of circumstances.3. He didn't use the stones to destroy the stones for no reason, he destroyed them so the Avengers could never use them to change back what he did, so I guess you could say he DID destroy them because he knew SOMEONE would come after them, that being the Avengers. I'll grant him doing it after two days is arbitrary but would it have made the movie better if they said he destroyed it a week ago because he thought that would be the best time? or maybe a month from then so it would be on his birthday? Does it really matter when he destroyed it? Honestly, that's the smartest thing he could have done and if Ant-Man wasn't saved by that glorious rat he would have gotten away with it.4. Speaking of rat, I think most people have a certain amount of leeway they will give a movie when it comes to contrivances and conveniences, sometimes you're able to look past them and sometimes you can't. If that rat hadn't pressed those buttons Ant-man would have been trapped in that realm forever and there would be no movie; that's true... but, I could say the same for many moments in the MCU. If that bomb that landed at Stark's feet had actually been an effective bomb he would have died instead of becoming Iron Man, if the plane landing in the frozen ocean actually killed Cap we wouldn't have Captain America in the present/future and there would be no other Captain America movies. I know mine could seem like a stretch but honestly, it only matters as to what degree you find them annoying, I thought it was stupid that the rat freed him but I saw it as a small moment that didn't really ruin the movie.5. The pacing problem only seems to be a problem if we look at this movie as a stand-alone movie and not a 'Part 2' to a two-parter finale for the MCU, there's a reason that when the movies were announced they were called ""Infinity wars part 1 and 2'. Now, could they have done some stuff to make it feel less bloated in some areas? I won't deny that but I think it was nice to see how the people of the world and the Avengers are dealing with the universe-spanning genocide they just had.6. I wouldn't say that Nebula connecting to her future self is arbitrary, we've never been given any reason not to believe something like this could or couldn't happen. We know very little of what goes on with the inner workings of Nebula so saying it's arbitrary isn't exactly right. Convenient? Yes. Arbitrary? No.7. You might say that everything is too easy in the time travel arc and yet you could point out several moments that cause conflict and problems, Hawkeye and Black widow, Stark losing the Tecceract thanks to the Hulk, Cap facing his former self, and you forgot Nebula being captured and kicking off the whole third act! There's plenty of conflict and issues that the team have to face off against. I am guessing you would mean more of an antagonistic threat but not every threat has to be solely forced by an antagonist. Hell, you could bring up a movie that doesn't have a main antagonist and that's the original Back to the Future, Marty is sent back in time by Doc Brown and he just needs to make sure his mom and dad get together, they didn't need a villain for it and yet it still felt compelling by having small conflicts and an overarching plot. Their small conflicts caused a ripple effect that brought the larger, antagonistic conflict to their timeline.8. The 'biggest' point people bring against this Thanos is that his driving motivation is non-existent but that is just plain wrong, his motivation is said in the movie! When he sees through Nebula that his plan is realized and the Avengers are trying to stop it, he travels to the present to stop that from happening. Once the Avengers bring back everyone, he sees that leaving half of the world alive would only cause more problems for him so he changes his plan, to start fresh! He realizes his first plan won't work and changes it accordingly, and people say there's no development.People are begining to expect movies serve them and should spoon feed them or massage their ego. What I hate about today's culture is that more and more people expect movies to bend to their will and not let creative people sxplore their ideas and present them in movies. Very quickly people get turned on and start criticizing movies only for the sake of criticism. I believe that comes from a tendency of over-saturation with movies nowadays. That's why people seem to be more ignorant towards how a story is played out and more critic about the message of the movie or it's characters. Which brings me to the biggest problem I see with this movie and IW. People claimed they were traumatized when they saw IW or that their hearts were broken. Yet, when I saw that film, at the end I felt absolutely nothing. You know why? Because it was so obvious that the heroes that got killed by the snap were coming back. I mean I'm no social media freak to see which MCU movie is announced to come out in the near future. I'm a normal guy who uses logic when he watches movies. So it is with IW. How can people find that shocking, heartbreaking or bold, when it's so obvious it was made in order to push the story in for a sequel? I mean how can someone believe those heroes were being killed when all of them have either had 1 solo movie each or maximum of two. So let me get this straight people criticize this movie's villain for having dumb 2 dimensional motivation but the same people praise IW for it's bold conclusion? Like in what world do we live in? A world where logic is thrown out the window and only our egos must be massaged, apparently. The only way you could say Thanos is a 2 dimensional villain in Endgame is if you completely throw out the window the motivation he had in Infinity War and pretend this Thanos is a totaly different person. So in IW he wanted for the universe to flourish, right? That didn't work because the Avengers couldn't move on with what happened and they managed to bring everyone back. So what would be the solution? While staying at the same time true to the character of Thanos from IW and his motivation? Right, a complete restart in which eeverything flourishes and everyone is happy and greatfull for what it was given. So basically what I'm trying to say with all this pish is that the way Thanos wants to corect the universe in Endgame, no one actually dies. Yes, the get killed and then recreated, but there isn't a mass genocide involved, where bilions of people die, right? You see now why killing people for others to strive in this particular case (MCU) doesn't function and that the only solution is a complete restart. And that is in perfect harmony with original Thanos' motivation from IW. He wanted balance, people to strive and flourish, so that's basically how you go about that. I think I've said enough about this. For me both Infinity War and Endgame are the peak of MCU, each with it's strenghts and weakeneses (IW's ending and Endgame's time travel). But both of them are bold, grand and epic movies that conclude this saga in an epic satisfying and fitting fashion. And looking at how and where our entertaining industry is moving now, they might as well be the last two good movies we'll ever get from the MCU. Time will tell... 10/10",positive
"Twenty movies of buildup leads to this; a three hour film that retains remarkably coherent and action-packed despite its length, full of fan-pleasing moments and fulfilment of several deserving character arcs. While not particular groundbreaking in any way, it is tightly plotted to keep the movie moving to near-perfection considering the massive ensemble cast and the amount of expectation it bears. Character arcs set up over years reach a climactic payoff that elicit powerful reactions. However, the plot revolves around massive coincidences and don't-think-too-hard gimmicks, while the great character work Thanos received in the previous film is completely undone here.As it was meant to, it acts as a grand ending to this arc of the MCU. Imperfect, yes, but a worthy signoff for years of hard work.",positive
"I love the MCU movies, been a huge fan right from Iron Man all the way to Infinity War. Avengers Endgame though not a bad movie, is not the ending the series deserved.
It felt like a real anti-climax after the epic Infinity War.
The pace is slow.
I mean seriously slow.
The characters have been ruined.
I mean WTF happened to Hulk and Thor?
Thor has been turned into a big fat beer swilling oaf and Hulk isn't the Hulk at all.
The whole idea behind the Hulk is that you get him angry and you don't like him when he's angry.
Instead they turned him into Shrek.
I didn't understand what the point was about all the jokes about Captain America's ass? it was completely unnecessary. It didn't add anything to the movie.
The humour throughout the movie was misplaced and wrong.
The funniest line for me was when Nebula told Gamora, she had the choice between him or a tree. Other than that, the humour was pretty bad.There are huge plot holes in the movie.
For instance, Thano's now travels forward in time to get the infinity stones and fails, which means he never got them in the first place so no one could have died the first time round.
Secondly, Nebula kills her past self. So how is she still alive in the future?
These weren't the only one's too. There were quite a lot of holes that simply didn't flow on from Infinity War.The whole thing with the time travel made a mess of the whole movie.Look, it's not a bad movie, per say, but after Infinity War, it had a lot to live up to.
Did it do it?
No.
The two best characters in Thor and Hulk especially after Thor Ragnarok were ruined for absolutely no reason whatsoever.
I kept hoping that sooner or later they would go back to their old selves, but that never happened.The final fight scene was a mess. The fight scene in Infinity War was so much better, with so much action going on all over the field, but it didn't feel disjointed, it flowed from scene to scene.
In Endgame the final fight scene felt like it was thrown together without any thought whatsoever.
Then the whole feminist fight scene at the end just summed up that Disney put more thought into their agenda pushing then the actual plot, it didn't add anything to the movie, if anything, it just looked out of place and silly.It's a real shame, because I really want to love this movie, especially after Infinity War, but am really struggling because there was so much of it that was completely pointless.
It's an end of an era, especially after the passing of the late, great Stan Lee.
I feel this movie could have had so much more.
A good movie, but not the ending the Avengers series deserved.",positive
"Absolutely FANTASTIC movie!! Very worthy end to a long cinematic history. Not often a movie gets this emotional, funny, exciting and heroic all rolled into one very refined roll.
The Russo brothers have done it! Absolutely blown away! From being corny now and then to an emotional rollercoaster right after that. A masterpiece!",positive
"I was immensely disappointed with this film. Avengers: Infinity War was exciting, had a good solid plot and story. I couldn't wait to see the follow up after the unbearable cliff hanger we were left with.Avengers:End Game had none of these qualities. It felt like 2.5 hours of sentimental drivel and a 20 minute battle scene. I understand they wanted to wrap up the Avengers story but it just felt like it was more of a homage to the characters rather than a proper film. I was looking at my watch 2 hours in to see how long I had left before I could leave.The only exciting part was the battle scene and that was poorly designed and predictable. If you want to see how a good battle scene is performed watch Game of Thrones S7 E3. That was ten times more exciting than the Avengers battle scene.Special effects are always good in the Avengers films and this is no exception. It looks and sounds great. There were some amusing scenes especially involving Thor but they didn't save this disappointingly average attempt of finishing the franchise.",positive
"The avengers: End game movie is the worst out of all the marvel movies. With an horrible end and a bad plot. For a normal, sane person this is a too wacky movie with a lot of weird twists. The only really good thing in this movie is the avengers theme song that gives the movie a little spark in the total darkness that it is in. If you consider watching this movie DON'T.",negative
"If you're am MCU fan then this movie is pure magic. The characters have never felt more human, the performances particularly Downey, Evans, Scarlett and Renner are terrific and the third act is pure comic book magic. If you're not a fan of mcu movies then this movie will probably confuse the hell out of you, the Russo's made this movie for all the fans and I cannot thank them, the screenwriters and Kevin Feige enough",positive
"The end of the 11 year of journey is here and what a movie it is we cried, laugh,joy the every movement foen the movie we can't express the movie in the words. Such a beautiful work by russo brothers and mcu and what a great end is given to all cherecters.",positive
This what I was been waiting for months for and it really good it was the best marvel movie out there and if you dont see this your real missing out over the fun,positive
"This is definitely the pinnacle of Marvel's years of story building, so epic, so mesmerizing, so perfect. I couldn't imagine any superhero movie could be any greater than this, at least not in the foreseeable future.
I don't think anybody should miss this movie. Watch it while it's still playing on theatres. This could be the greatest movie of this decade, or even any decade for that matter.",positive
"This isn't just hype! This movie proved everything is possible.
The Russo's Brothers did an astonishing work closing this 10 year saga, and it couldn't be more perfect than this.
They and Marvel knew they couldn't screw this up, and Oh My...
This is everything a fan of this saga can hope for and so much more.
I still have no words that can describe this movie more than incredible, astonishing, incredible, perfect.
This is the finale we needed and they sure delivered.
It comes full circle, and that's what makes it even more touching and so real in so many ways, it's a superhero movie, yet the way it's so grounded is unbelievable.
A closure that not every movie/writer/producer can pull of.",positive
"The best super hero film ever made!
Just like my headline says. Watch this masterpiece for the love of God! This and infinity war are on totally different levels to any other super hero film. And this goes one level better than infinity war, absolutely fantastic.",positive
Good but a bit overrated movie by marvel fans. I was excited before watching the movie but after watching the movie not meeting my expections.,positive
"This is perhaps one of the biggest movies of all time if not THE biggest film of all time! Avengers endgame is a stunning love letter to fans of the MCU, and will truly leave an impact on the whole movie industry. The movie is just so spectacular that I can't even cover everything with mere words in this review. Infinity War was spectacular but this movie is the one that for the last 12 years has been built up to. There are plenty of Easter eggs and references to the past movies that true fans will understand. The acting is great from all involved and the visuals are incredible. This movie is quite an emotional ride, and it will have you going through a whole range of different emotions and it's 3 hour run time. I can't say enough for this movie, just be prepared for your heart to be racing Non-Stop! I don't want to spoil anything because there is just so much to spoil for those who have not seen it yet. This movie will be talked about for many many years, and there will never be another quite like it.",positive
"The first 2 hours of the movie were pretty boring. Great last hour but, boy, was I ready to get to the final hour. Did love last scene with Cap America. Won't say anything more. CA:WS and first Avengers were my faves. This ranks probably #3 or #4 of the Marvel movies. Plus sweet cameo by Stan Lee. Would have been funnier if he had not died recently. Bitter sweet.",positive
"It's like they wrote the script after 3 AM the day before the deadline. This is the worst Marvel MCU film ever. Even Age of Ultron was seriously better than this,",negative
"To describe this movie, let's just say it was 'AWESOME!!'. The plot hole might be confusing for some people. But if you are a true marvel fan, you will be able to understand the storyline here. And yeah! NUFF SAID!!",positive
"21 films, 11 franchises, 11 years... the game has come to an end.It started way back when I was just 7 years old and Iron Man had come out in cinemas back in 2008. Today, I am now 18 and watching Avengers: Endgame on it's first day of release here in Australia meant so much to me and my best mate.Together, we laughed, tried not to cry and rode waves of nostalgia as we saw the extended superhero journey of our childhood reach it's climatic conclusion...it reached it perfectly.But before I get to the positives there were some negatives to this film. Rest assured, no spoilers are ahead.For those who are die hard Marvel fans like myself and my best mate, there will be moments in this film that you will not like and that may even confuse you, this is only inevitable as us fans tend to over analyse everything. At points, the film will be very predictable to us and so my advice to both fans as well as non-fans going into Endgame is this, watch it with open ears, a silent mouth and just let the film consume you.For Avengers: Endgame, the positives far outweigh the negatives, this three hour spectacular of a culmination of everything Marvel Studios has offered us for the past ten years has the right plot, correct conflicts and a resolution that was meant to be. How can all of these elements that make a film excellent be absent from Endgame when you've got so many characters each belonging to their respective franchises expressing their chemistry with each other. Not to mention the extensive character development that has taken place over the past decade, each moment in each Marvel Studios film before Endgame has ensured that the final chapter in the biggest movie franchise of all time is to be the greatest one of them all.Disney CEO Robert Iger, Marvel Studios President Kevin Fiege and directors Anthony and Joe Russo should be proud of what they have accomplished. This will never happen again.The whole cast and crew involved should pat their backs in unison. Most notably, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner are going to be remembered for taking part and serving as the core backbone of what is the most legendary feat ever performed in cinema history.Thank you Stan ""The Man"" Lee.(10/10)",positive
"I found that this was a perfect conclusion of some characters stories and for the most part, Phase 3",positive
I liked it when it came out and I still like it. It became better for me when I rewatched it.,positive
"Movie is perfect, perfect final to infinity saga, thanks marvel",positive
"I just loved it.... absolutely! A walk down memory lane in the best of ways... that 3 hours went like a ""snap of the fingers""... there were tears and there were cheers and then there was finality!!! Goodbye to The Avengers as we knew them... and loved them",positive
"Of course, Comedy with Fantasy and Action. The heroes are like your uncles and aunts, fun to watch but not what pumps your senses for the thrill.
You'll feel all the time like it's meh, because they want to make all audiences enjoy the movie. Doing that the movie becomes average. So the characters are all good hearted and full of feelings, nothing like a hero who has True Will.
I'm glad that at least this last movie didn't come with ideological references, it was just this polictical correctness that numbs us as society. Everyone is a good boy there.
Anyway, the public that Marvel seeks now is not me. No problem, since I noticed it, I'll just ignore future movies from them.
Leave a thumbs up if now you also agree it's a comedy movie not an action thriller movie, so other people can see this too.",positive
What a wonderful movie👌We are just glued to every scene with excitement,positive
"Let me tell you why infinity war was better than this. Endgame sucked at the end actually.
Points:
1. At the end, Thanos came from past, but had no gauntlet. All of the avengers came to fight him and his army. Thor had both Hammer as well as Axe. Yet, they were unable to beat thanos who was without gauntlet.
2. Hulk got a beating of his life from thanos in infinity war, and yet, Dr. Hulk was not given a chance to fight Thanos. No revenge.Endgame sucked in emotions.
1. Thor went to asgard in time travel. He saw his mother, and the emotions were like nothing. It was like normal for him.
2. Tony died at the end, but pepper who just came to him, shed 1 or maybe no tears and a kiss to forehead. What? Where was the emotions here for her?
3. One more I remember. When Clint and Black widow are thinking who will get sacrificed. Man! When black widow died, look at Clints emotions. Just like fake weeping. I challenge you to match it with Thanos's sacrifice for soul stone and look at his emotions from infinity war. Believe it or not, I felt that Thanos's emotion. Even, I felt weeping.In the beginning, the avengers acted like Cowards.
1. Thanos, who was very sick by destroying stones. They just came to him and chopped his head off. Okay. Revenge is a beautiful thing. But that looked like a coward act.Good points:
1. The meeting between Iron man and his father in past.
2. Cap vs cap in past.
3. All those past scenes were a thing of beauty.I am not a director, but I felt the movie could have been better. How? Maybe having avengers fight the all powerful thanos at the end who has say all stones but snap couldn't work for sometime till the infinity stones gain their power back after first snap.They fight the powerful thanos. At the end, it looked like a one way fight where avengers were clear winners. Man! Why didn't they made thanos more powerful again somehow.
Damnit! He was fighting all avengers with no gauntlet.",positive
Weak writing.Bad guys are bad for the sake of being bad.Too much reliance upon CGI and cute punchlines.,negative
"This movie is something amazing! There's no point that have gaps : the costumes, the incredible acting of everyone, the whole story, the script, the directing. In fact, the end (and not so) of one story, that left a scar in every who watch it. The CGI is on top-level. Let'a see what Phase 4 will present to us!!!
Love you 3000",positive
"Saw it yesterday at the midnight launch and wow!Im not going into detail for this review.Im going to talk about things I was unsure of. The first hour dragged ever so slightly and the humor was a hit and miss but it did deliver some good laughs. Thor in endgame was very different and will create a divide of people who like his new character and people who dont. He was very different in Infinity War. I understand why he became the character he is but it was very unexpected.Thats all.Everything else was epic!
The plot, the time travel, the shocks and the fights!I cried with sadness and excitement towards the end.The film ends perfectly to please fans who have been with us since the start and it was just an incredible experience throughout.Just put through different emotions with different characters.This is the best superhero film and the best trill for a big marvel/superhero film.Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.Thank you and good luck!",positive
"This movie is just straight fan service in my opinion, it's a fantastic payoff to the 11 years of the MCU. I think it's probably one of the best endings we could have gotten. But, there are many flaws, like the CGI. It has very good effects but it has way to much. About half of the movie is on a green screen. And I'm not exaggerating, it's definitely the most effects heavy movie in the MCU. That's just my opinion though. The acting is actually a lot better than I thought it would be and that sounds quite bad, but I was really impressed with some of the performances. Particularly from Chris Evans and Jeremy Renner. A lot more depth compared to previous movies. RDJ is great as usual but I still think his best performance is in Iron Man (2008), doesn't mean it's disappointing, just in my opinion is outshines by other strong performances. I think the length of the movie is actually good as it's never really boring or slow. I think it's probably the second best superhero movie this year, because I think Joker is amazing. But it's still a very good movie but if I was to be honest, probably a little over-hyped, I think it's because it's a fan service movie and I don't consider myself an ""MCU fanboy"", but that view can very much change depending on the viewer. But yeh, really good.",positive
"The best Marvel Studios Movie ever I love the scene when ant man, professor hulk, captain America and Iron Man go to the New York battle (2012) that scene Is epic also the scene all the superheroes back (guardians of the galaxy, Wasp, Spiderman, doctor Strange, black Panther, etc).",positive
"This film is just PERFECTION. The story, acting, characters, emotion, humor, action, and the soundtrack is top notch! That film has everything I wanted it to be. And after i saw it online and Disney Plus, I was not only happy in emotion and cried. It just putted a smile in my face. This is my personal favorite 2019 film and it's the best Marvel film ever in my honest opinion.",positive
Incredible movie and an amazing way to wrap up 11 years of great movies! An achievement!,positive
The film has no pace besides the big battle that in fact is to short and feels like nothing according to what I expected for a new fight with e thanosSome character directions of important heroes like Thor and hulk where ridiculous . And these characters contributed nothing to the stories besides transmitting weaknessAlso the movie was overwhelmed by overpowering woman and non white characters . I understand the need to give equal importance to every king of heroe but not to the cost of the most importa ones .Also the script was full of things without logic,positive
"THE RUSSO BROTHERS SCORE BIG ON THIS ONE BUT I'M EXTREMELY UPSET ABOUT THE LOSS OF NATASHA ROMANOFF... NOT EVEN A TEAR OR A FUNERAL FOR THIS FANTASTIC, BEAUTIFUL WARRIOR... THEY COULD'VE DONE HER BETTER THAN THAT. AS GREAT AS THIS MOVIE WAS, I COULDN'T ENJOY IT TO THE FULLEST BECAUSE I WAS IN DISBELIEF. I'LL BE WATCHING IT AGAIN AND TRY TO UNDUE THIS WRONG BY SNAPPING MY OWN FINGERS.",positive
"I have to say that Endgame was enjoyable, albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons, yet this is to be expected when all the MCU is combined into this strange conclusion. The performances are very good, although one is left wondering what the point of introducing Captain Marvel was due to her lack of actual contribution to ""the grand plan"". I firmly believe that this could have been done better by postponing its release or splitting it into more parts so that the pacing, the tone and at times even the story wouldn't be so all over the place. However, I am glad to have seen the conclusion of the franchise and hopefully Marvel will continue to deliver great movies in the future.",positive
"This is what happens when movies start taking themselves too seriously. Why did they turn this franchise into a tedious melodrama? What's with all the emotional drama in a movie about flying hammers and talking raccoons? Why are these superheroes so weak and human? Thor the God of Lightning is reduced by the writers to an alcoholic pot-bellied homeless man, which deprives the character of his power. The plot is unoriginal, lazy and uninspiring. I think they're out of ideas. AVOID.",negative
The movie had some bad points but mostly it was amazing also when iron man dies it's so sad,positive
"The film was very beautiful. It combines drama, action and comedy. It was a very nice mix so far. It is certainly the best film of MCU films and also the best film I have seen so far this year.",positive
"Starting off, I would say that it is rewatchable as well as memorable.True if you watch the movie there are a few plot hole - cause there's time travel in it - but the projects of marvel coming on will surely clear that out.This could be.. I mean, This is one of the best superhero movies ever made!",positive
"Warning: spoilers belowSo they really pull all the punches to make this as entertaining and fitting an end to this arc of the marvel universe as possible, and it really shows; I doubt even with future releases that Marvel studios will be able to give us something like this again. Hell, I might even have liked it more if not for (see below for spoiler section)*SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS*I feel they could have given Black Widow a better send off; having her as an afterthought during the funeral scene seemed a little insulting, particularly when they were selling the ""yea look at all the women"" schtick just a few scenes earlier. I wouldn't have even cared, if I didn't know deep down in my heart just how much this would be reflected in the pay difference between many of the dudes in this film and the women; any of these not being the case would have avoided the situation, but all three just made it feel like hollywood preaching the neoliberal selling of feminism as a brand for their product rather than something that was making legitimate strides in the movie industry. But hey, not film-ruining or anything for me, I just think this aspect could have been handled better.",positive
First two hours was hilarious and the best Climax of the world cinema. Russo bros nailed it. It doesn't felt like 3 hrs movie. Undoubtedly best of MCU.,positive
"What a sensational end to this particular arc of the MCU. Quality film!'Avengers: Endgame' is all of what I expected/wanted and more. I got goosebumps twice throughout the (masterfully paced) 181 minute run time, I can't say many films have inflicted that on me! Love the ending and the way the Infinity Saga story wraps up.The action is ultra thrilling, the score is fantastic and the effects remain great. I will say I don't think they nail the screen time for all involved outstandingly - that's not a negative, at all, it's just the fact that 'Captain America: Civil War' and 'Avengers: Infinity War' did it to an incredibly higher degree previously.The cast are marvellous, pardon the pun. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans remain superb and are still the most standout, though you also have the likes of Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin, Scarlett Johansson, Bradley Cooper and Mark Ruffalo - love the look of Hulk in this one, btw.I've only become properly aware of all of the MCU in the last two weeks or so, yet this still gave me a memorable experience seeing this main story crescendo like this - I imagine it would've been quite the journey 'live' from ten years or so prior to the release of this.Look forward to continuing with 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' and the end of Phase Three, and then - all things well - beyond.",positive
Ranged from merely ok to messy and contrived. Disappointed they resorted to a time travel movie (was that the best they could come up with??). Hated what they did to Hulk and Thor. Hawkeye was irritating and Captain Marvel was hyped up for basically nothing... Infinity War was far far better.,positive
This movie was just perfect. dont listen the others because they're angry that this movie has a high rating on imdb and high score on rotten tomatoes,positive
After infinity war I really had very high hopes from this. Bit disappointed-,positive
"Im a very critical movie watcher, so if you are not prepared for nitpicking than please understand my review might not be for you. I enjoyed the movie very much, now lets get to the juicy things I wish the movie had done instead. I know its a Disney movie but that doesn't stop me from wanting to see the most epic comic book movie in history if they changed a few things.1. Thanos never kills anyone(besides loki *maybe*) A. SOME people died in this movie (black widow, Iron Man) but they died from heroic sacrifice. Not from Thanos's power. B. I wanted to see Thanos kill Iron man, or Thor, or Any major character. After the movie 3-5 people should have been dead and your like, What now? But instead almost everyone is alive and you can already see the next movies coming out soon. C. In Infinty War Thanos was the biggest baddest guy in the universe, In this movie the avengers are fighting a new Thanos that isnt even that bad ass or cool or anything, thats why he should have killed someone on the battle field like Captain America. To show the strenght and might and danger of Thanos. I like Capstain America's happy ending, but I would have liked it even more if he died to Thanos and Hulk or Thor got revenge, which leads to point 2.2. Thor, Hulk, Capetian America, Iron man, Captain Marvel, or Someone should have killed Thanos in battle on the battle field. Imagine if Captain America died by Thanos hands, and HULK goes into a rage and kills Thanos. Then they take the glove off of his and and do the snap. Then Hulk would be a legend and that would be part of the history forever. Hulk Thanos killer, or Thor the Asgaurd god who killed Thanos. 2A. Instead legends like Thor and Hulk are reduced to side comic characters like the antler Gaurdian of the galaxy lady and rocket racoon. Thor even leaves at the end with the Racoon and Gaurdians, and seems to join their crew and set up for the next comedy action movie..... which is funny and great. But I would have preferred the fighter warrior Thor. The Thor that opened a sun onto himself to reforge his hammer. What the heck happened to the Thor who almost killed Thanos In Infinity war? why did we get this comedy relief fat Thor. Yes he is really funny. But I would have preferred him to fight toe to toe with Thanos, instead of make a few jokes. 2B. HULK got the same treatment as a comic/clown. He can kill Thanos. Hulk literally never got mad and angry and started smashing people. He never smashed Thanos or fought him at all in this movie.3. To many emotional scenes, Hawkeye walking his dog...etc. Tony Stark doing a pov youtube video documentary about if he wants to fight or not. These are the greatest fighters in history in the greatest fight against their greatest enemy. Show some more fight scenes. Show some intensity and tension. They went back in time so easy and got the stones so easy as they are cracking jokes. Black widow soul gem scene was good, but they still needed some fight scenes. Someone should have died to retrieve one of the stones. or should have got stuck in time or something.4.Fake gauntlet. Why did Thanos go to the Asgard holy weapon site to make that gauntlet, the only thing that can hold the infinity stones, if iron man can just hold the stones on his robot arm. I thought the Gauntlet was special and magical. I dont like that scene at all. Why couldn't someone just kill Thanos and then they use the gauntlet to snap after they pull it off his dead hand. They wanted it to be more tense, but it just created a plot hole and just breaks the reality and power of the gauntlet and the stones and all of the lore.5. So my main gripe with the movie even though I enjoyed it for funs sake, was that no real consequences happened. Only Theoretical consequences people sacrificing themselves for the greater good etc boring storyline. I wanted Thanos the biggest bad guy in comic books, to have done something of weight. In the end he did nothing. He should have killed Iron man. He should have killed Captain America or Thor, or Scarlett witch or all three of them. His plan got completely foiled and he personally did no damage. weak. Thanos is weak, he couldn't kill one measly earth defender.6, Captain marvel flying around for no reason doing no damage, weak.Infinity war had more tension, more fights, and more deaths in battle. I am highly disappointed from this great movie. Highly Dissapointing Great Movie",negative
"This was truly the first time that as I was watching, I felt like I immediately recognized a movie's future significance. The duology of Infinity War and Endgame, I believe, will be remembered as the pinnacle of superhero movies. That's all there is to it.",positive
"Let's be honest, I thought I'd find the cinemas in Baghdad will be half empty for Endgame, but all cinemas booked already a day earlier from release in 25th and couldn't find a place until Monday 29th early morning, the crowds was unbelievable, sort of a new thing to see in Baghdad's cinemas.
As a start, the movie start what everyone saw in the trailers, for the first 30 minutes we all know what will happens, after that things got changed.
I presume many many saw the movie but no spoilers for the next parts.I enjoyed the film very much, i'll watch it again, but there is something missing.
I couldn't feel that the action at the start was good enough until final battle, and it also got some missing things in my opinion, I was expecting more huge battle since it's the battle for everything, comparing it to (ready player one final battle).
Too much drams comparing it with Infinity War, but due to the 3 hours long film i'd say ok.
The movie covers everything.Spoilers ahead....
The twist for the movie is good, some details was unexpected like captain america can hot Thor's hammer, no one expected that would happen.
The time travel things was done very well, links all events together and the timeline was good.
The end of the film was surely a big thing and most of everyone know's that the rich man will die for the ultimate sacrifice, but in this point I gave the 9 starts of 10... and here is why.
I was expecting more winning by the avengers in the final battle with thanos and more action from Iron man before he took the stones back to him... he made the hand specially for this purpose and put the stones in it because he know he'll need to steel it by nano tech. he learns from his previous fail, he need to act quickly, but disappointed in the other hand from his new suit, thought i'd see something ells.
The ultimate sacrifice.. end of era... thank you for a good 11 years.
The Good: It Covers everything you can imagine.
The Bad: Too much funny moments for a film that will end a long story line.
The Ugly: The end's action could be more better.Peace from Iraq...",positive
"I wish the action / fight scenes were longer - explanations on ""time-machine"" would've been more profound. More of the bonding sessions - our Heroes long talks and walking down memory lane, I am very fond of this. Nevertheless, Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have crafted a well-paced, character-driven movie event. It will give you goosebumps, holding back any form of excitement or despair, and if you're a Marvel fan you will be geeking out over all the references to iconic comic book moments in there.Btw... What happened to Loki when he was caught and then managed to get hold of the Tesseract? Or did Capt and IronM go waaay back in time to retrieve it-again? And Oh that All-Female superhero scene! - heading towards enemies (she's not by herself) seemed a lil cheesy for me... Catwalk here and single ladies there LoL - How come our human heroes can breathe on another planet???Hulk's change of personality was not appealing for his character. Neither was Thor's. Was is a cute-funny thing they were going for? I believe it would have been hilarious if Hulk were to be his angry self and Thor remains the insecure yet masculine God. Viewers may not like Thor's new look, but he needed to be physically 'different' to tone down his Hotness!Perhaps every confusing bit and unsettling views from everyone for this movie would encourage another finaleee.AE did not feel like a 3 hours movie at all - Not when you've already invested so much emotion and care into these characters. Thank you so much for a great storyline and performance. Thank you to the writers and artists who were involved in this movie! Almost a perfect wrap up =)",positive
"The movie is great, but not the best marvel movie to date. If you mix Infinity war + the last 1 hour of this movie, you actually get a masterpiece movie (10/10).
In the 2 first hours, the movie was slow, and it felt more like a tribute to the 10 years of the marvel universe. I guess they wanted to connect the fans with the older movies.
The last hour was excellent, and the action exceeded expectation. Of course, there are some holes in the plot, but Marvel does not let us down. Once again, another movie that Marvel fans won't forget easily.",positive
"Wow! At the end of this movie I just didn't know how to process what I had just seen - it was that good. For the last five years Winter Soldier had been my favourite MCU movie - today that changed. It is a rare occasion that I give a movie a 10/10 but this movie just blew me away and I felt many emotions throughout it. If you're a fan of the MCU go see it ASAP before it gets spoiled for you.
For those trolls giving it a 1/10 - come on, you're either a DC troll (you can like both Marvel and DC) or someone with no soul.",positive
I didn't even realize three hours have passed until the movie ended. Best movie I've ever seen.,positive
"I want to get this out that I don't think marvel is overrated. Although I'm not a huge fan of the whole universe, I can understand why many are. I really like a great deal of the movies, my favourites is probably guardians 1 and 2
I'm very happy that this is a financial success, it's always fun to see marvel out do themselves at the box office, and this film is nearly the highest grossing movie of all time.
Critically however I find this movie overrated, Unlike infinity war this film meanders a lot. Many of the jokes don't land and some of the scenes are down right stupid. I though the last action scene was great and the dialogue like usual is fun
If you think this is the best movie ever I don't want to change your opinion, personally I cannot understand this being 0.5 ratings below the Godfather",positive
"Without second thoughts I would say that it wad the most impressive work for Marvel.. makes you feel sad, happy, excited and thrilled to the max all in one movie",positive
"Brie Larson is simply bad, somewhere between terrible and bland. She's the worst thing about this movies and if it weren't for the not only great but incredibly charismatic cast she'd have definitely tainted this movies. That said, watch it.",positive
"Even whilst watching it, I felt disappointed: slow, wordy, sloppy storyline. Even the final battle was excessive to the point of tedious: too much fast cutting and too many unnecessary characters. Despite enjoying and appreciating most of the Marvel films, I felt this was a letdown.",negative
"This film is awesome, simples.The ones saying it's rubbish etc are just trying to be 'Edgy'.Don't read the reviews. If you like comic\super hero films, then this is a must.",positive
"There is one way to describe this movie and that is satisfying. It is satisfying in the way that everything you would want to see resolved is resolved and even things established in other movies have conclusions/payoffs. There are too many standout moments to count as everyone will have their own favorite moment. I don't know if we will ever see something like this ever again from marvel, but it is a movie that must be seen if you have invested your time in all these characters. You will not be disappointed",positive
Marvel proved me VERY wrong. It was one of the best movies I have seen in 20 years. The links to the past and the empathy of the new stories made it 3 hours of pure pleasure. I bloody loved it!,positive
"*Internally screaming in excitement, joy, fear, and sadness all at the same time*",positive
THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE OR BETTER THE BEST MOVIE EVER.I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT AGAIN,positive
No amount of words can explain this rollercoaster of emotions 😱😱😱😱😱😱,positive
"As a Fan I feel Like cheated by Marvel Studios. Avengers: Endgame is a cut paste collage of previous movies & sloppy VFX ( one can watch it under magnifying glass when its Blu Ray is released). Within 3 hours of this movie 1.5 hours was of repetitions. After all the hype, theories & speculations, All that Anthony & Joe Russo cooked was a plot that even a Kindergarten MCU fan could've scripted better and Many succeeded with their far Superior imagination & theories than MCU team. Time Travel is a pathetic excuse to deal with Thanos after all the wonderful Avengers Series MCU has executed on Cinematic world Arena. It felt like they knew Endgame would be the Big Hit so they served the old potpourri with not more than 10 minutes of WOW action moments. Stan Lee's demise affected the outcome of this Movie that could have been the Milestone for Cinema Entertainment for Years to come. Wonder if this is highest Peak of MCU's Success Story. 6 Stars for many disappointments",positive
"On an introductory note, I've noticed a few scattered, rather negative (1-5 stars) reviews here, and most of them seem to be complaining about pace, lack of action, plot-holes, ""Hulk did this"", ""Thor did that"", etc. and certainly everyone is entitled to their opinion. However, a good majority of these reviews sound like they're coming from people who had jumped way too hard on the hype train, had ridiculously high expectations, or have invested a majority of their life in the MCU. Additionally, if (hypothetically) the pace and action of ""Endgame"" had followed the same style as ""Infinity War"" these same bedroom-dwelling critics would likely complain ""OMG! The pace and action was too similar to Infinity War! I'm so disappointed... blah blah blah"". And if ""Endgame"" somehow outpaced its predecessor with more action and fight scenes, most movie goers would likely be nauseated with an abundance of CG and a more confusing story-line.Now, on to my review (sort of) short, sweet, and spoiler free. I've seen nearly all of the Marvel movies except 2 or 3 of them, and I've never witnessed anything like ""Endgame"" and I don't think I ever will again, in this lifetime anyway. While Endgame wasn't as fun and action-packed as a few other movies (including Infinity War), it was an emotional, complete masterpiece of movie-making. I felt like I was watching several Marvel movies all wrapped up into one nicely designed package. Even though it all happened in a span of about 3 hours and the pace was rather slow in the first half, it never felt like the film was dragging and I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Although Endgame was somewhat flawed and had some disappointing and confusing moments (a tiny, small spoiler: the time travel' stuff), character issues and lost opportunities for a more redeeming scene/moment, I never felt these very minor issues detracted any of the movie's story and overall feel and atmosphere throughout. Not afraid to admit this but for one of the rarest moments in my life, I cried during a few various scenes for very obvious reasons. In my opinion, ""The Avengers: Endgame"" is not only one of the top Marvel movies ever made, but will stand the test of time as one of the greatest movies made during the 21st century. Having said all of that, I'll probably visit the theater one or two more times, as should everyone :)",positive
"Think they've done the super hero thing to death and this one is no better or worse than any of the others, except it's a good 30 minutes too long. The CGI runs rampant as always, plot is ludicrous as they usually are with these things and if this truly is the final instalment it's come non too soon! A lot of young people love these kind of films of course and good luck to them, me, I'd prefer a good western!",positive
"This wasn't just bad as in disappointing, it was one of the worst films I've ever endured. I was enjoying it until 'time travel', and from then on it spiralled downwards until it hit rock bottom. Just terrible.
You know how Iron Man 3 was unwatchable? Well imagine that, but a hundred times worse and even longer.
It amazes me how someone, at some point, gave this the green light to be made and then wasted $350million on this disaster.
It's difficult to know where to start with this insufferable abomination, but I guess it must just be me as it made a ton of money at the box office and seems to get decent reviews.
If this is an indication of the standard of where the Avengers movies were heading, then good riddance. The proof in what I'm saying is the appallingly bad 'Spider-Man Far From Home', which is also one of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to see.
I give it one star for the last 20 minutes where the series was wrapped up.
Disney, please don't inflict any more of this garbage on the world.",negative
"It's MARVEL of course the editing, directing will be distinguished.The only thing is that I felt that the majority of the story is about tony stark. And It could have been better for the film if thanos did not die from the begining.Other than that, the film is great.",positive
"Brilliant

Kinda feels rushed through the beginning kinda wish the end was cut into one more movie because there is so much they could have done. But im pleased regardless,positive
"I'm not that much fan of Avengers series. So, it is kind of difficult for me to review this kind of films. I always see Avengers films are concerning with fights and battles (those kinds of things) but this one is kind of different. It also has some drama. Well, sort of. So, I find it some scenes are a bit boring. But I could watch it. Hence, it's fine.It's so sad to see Iron Man died. But I was touched to see when he sacrificed his life to save a lot of people. And Thanos? He even sacrificed his own daughter just to get the stone. I just wished that Iron Man didn't die. He's sweet guy even though sometimes, he felt like he was better than anyone.Another touchable thing is to see Captain America went back time and married the girl who is he once loved and missed a chance to get her. It's so good to see he finally has a chance to try. Although he became an old man when he went back, but he had great/sweet time with his girl he loves. So, I think it's totally worth it. And that scene is so sweet even though it's so sad to see.There's one thing that I don't understand. About Nebula, past Nebula died. Doesn't mean there's no Nebula anymore? But the present Nebula still exists. If there's no past, how the present exists? 🤔This film ended with sad ending. So, as the one who loves to see happy ending, I'd say it's kind of inferior to the other films which have happy ending. Not all films end with happy ending. That I understand. But I just want to see happy ending. Films are for entertainment anyway. 😁Overall is that Avengers series are always the best even I'm not that fan of it. This film is also a good one too. It gives sweet moments and all. The special effects are good, yet, the fighting scenes are a little bit simple. I want to see more of it and awesome complex fighting scenes. That being said, the current one is doing fine and I've totally enjoyed it.",positive
Perfect ending to a great story that we have been lucky to see over the last decade,positive
It couldnt be better than this. I enjoyed every second of this cinematography icon.,positive
"The storyline is confusing for anyone under the age of 13 and there are so many plot holes in this film, like why not use the timestone to reverse certain events. And I thought the gems couldn't be handled by mortals (gaurdians 1). Personally I feel the film is moping around to much trying to make the emotional links for Iron man and Cap as by the end of the film we know there going to be no more. (Which was a good way of getting rid due to there contracts running out). They made it an emotional rollercoaster not a thrilling action adventure I expect MCU to provide.",positive
"Loved it so much, just can't see a story with so much depth getting better.",positive
"The film is an epic finale of the Avengers universe, the scale of it can't be measured, and this scale unites people all over the World, I am grateful for it. However, I find Infinity War even better: it is more tragic, more concentrated on the action itself and has fewer problems.
A few things went wrong with this film in my personal and humble opinion, I will hope that people will tend to notice these cons as well:
1. fat Thor, yes, it's fun, what is the point of making him literally a god in Thor 3 and the most powerful avenger in the Infinity War? I just don't think it is suitable for the Endgame.
2. Hulk - Benner, it's cool that he was able to find himself, but you are not a Hulk anymore, Hulk's power is in rage, not in glasses and a couple of PhDs.
3. Extremely overpowered Thanos. Remember this damn good scene of Tony fighting Thanos on Titan, when the latter had Infinity Stones? Tony had more chances back then, then now with the upgraded suit.
4. Tony's snap. Why didn't he fly away with stones, teleport...or why the stones have affected him so much when he only decimated Thanos' army? (It has a definitely smaller effect than decimating/bringing back half of the universe). He should have survived.
5. Captain America with Mjolnir. Yes, it was EPIC, literally, for these few minutes, my heart stopped beating, because of this fight. However, if CA could almost beat Thanos' ass, why couldn't Thor (who is a god btw) with 2 of his weapons?
6. Captain Marvel. She should have been given a bigger part in this film. The only thing she was needed for - destroy a spaceship.
I think these cons somehow greatly affect the whole film, and if they were made differently, I would definitely think of this film as one of the greatest ever.
Thank you for this journey, which started with the Jericho missile and ended up making RDJ the most powerful hero in the universe for a few seconds. Robert, thank you! The whole Marvel universe owes you.",positive
"This is the saddest review I have ever had to write. After the culmination of all the films and the Snap at the end of Avengers Infinity Wars they blew it. Fat Thor was funny for about 5 minutes then was just annoying, the Hulk was reduced to a joke quite frankly with none of his anger just stupid glasses. Most of the characters didn't get a look an and the first half of the film was just annoying. When the final fight does happen it is so unrealistic, with characters having bonding sessions as aliens and superheros were fighting all around them. Captain Marvel was in the film for about 10 seconds and destroyed the aliens so easily she made the rest of the characters redundant.
If the Russo Brothers had spent less time trying to get their friends and family cameo roles and more time trying to make the film we deserved it would have been a good thing. I am so disappointed in this movie it has left me heartbroken at the untimely end to what was one of my favorite film series ever.
It is a mess, the time travel was nonsensical, action was limited and the trademark humor was missing.
I have no idea what the writers and directors were thinking.
Oh and Iron Man dies",negative
"Spoilers ahead!Not too much more to say than what's already been said out there on the interwebs. But I just viewed this for the second time and had a few thoughts.Overall: Great story telling, slow build to the big final action sequence, sure there are a few flaws but they are all so easily overlooked. The humor, the heartbreak, heavy and light tones, it's all there. I loved all the references and Easter eggs. There are so many I cought in the second viewing that I missed at first. ""On your left!"". (Even one as simple as T'challa calling Hawkeye ""Clint"" after his, now memed, response to Clint's introducing himself in Civil War, ""I don't care""). Great action sequences throughout, especially at the end, wow!The perfect ending: Upon a second viewing the foreshadowing is there and it's well done. Once Strange holds up the 1 we see it click, we see Tony accept his fate. One huge thing I took from this scene that I missed in my first viewing was a line that Howard Stark told Tony when they were speaking back in 1970. Howard told him a mistake that he's made: ""The greater good rarely outwayed my own self interest"". I have no doubt that Tony thought about that line right before he snapped with the stones to save everything and everyone, at the expense of his own life. As a parent myself the dynamic of saving the world but leaving your family without you really hit me hard and brought tears to my eyes both times I watched. Ultimately this was a great polish up and send off to Tony Stark, we see both his tender side and his heroic side in this final film, well done RDJ!And Cap got his dance. :)Perfect capstone to this saga and an absolute prefect culmination of 10 years of films! ""I love you 3000""",positive
"Lucky to have watched it in the very first preview, not going to be spoiling things, but people you are witnessing a conclusion of 22 Movies, you can't be fair enough while Judging, unless you have seen the efforts of 10 years of Experience in making best stories to best movies, believe that or not, if you saw the rest movies and have an idea of what every character represents you will deeply appreciate that movie, and easily say it worth 15/10, so many sacrifices, so many happiness, joy and laughter, best cinema experience among all competitors, finally gotta say, MCU rocks all the way, after a low hit in Captain Marvel, they hit back in a way to blow your mind

I was so suprised when i saw the first infinity film. Everything made sense and Worked together. But when i saw this movie some parts just didn't fit. The overall humor didn't do the movie any good. The Thor is fat and the Hulk is both strong and smart joke got old really fast. I fellt like the movie wasn't insink with the first one.The ending was satisfying but didn't make up for the rest.The first acts of the movie really were promissing but they lost it somewhere in the middel. This one is a 7 and the first one a 9.My overal problem is that this movie misses the pace the first one had.So go watch the movie and see it yourself.,positive
To start off this is just a groundbreaking movie in cinema. It has great character and great performances. Visual effects as always are stunning. I though the concept can be a little better. Other than that the movie is a masterpiece.,positive
"Can someone please explain how they survived the VERY powerful bombardment on the Avengers building and after that Hawkeye (who is just a regular human !!!) runs with the gauntlet like Usain Bolt ? apart from the time travel stupidity , this must be the dumbest scene in the movie, pure offence to anyone with a brain, far from entertainment , but no worries, people forget quickly after a few tears over Tony",positive
"The first part of this film is painful to watch, as there's very little dialogue. The plot isn't much good either. I don't see why people loved it so much. And it's way too long.",negative
"The start of Avengers Endgame leaves every single spectator cold and sympathized locating them in a world after-the-snap where the emptiness that left those who have left and the pain of those who are still, have been present during five long years.
Then, The Avengers discover a very risky posibility for bringing everybody back, but our heroes will try it ""Whatever it takes"".
Followed by this discovery, Marvel transports us towards a ride through several of the events that ocurred in its cinematographic universe to gather again the infinity gems paying tribute to more than 10 years of films.
After this trip that brings with it a very hight cost, we find ourselves with a spectacular and emotive third act full of an overwhelming fan-service that will never be forgotten by its fans, closing masterfully and uniquely the Infinity Saga.
The movie came with very high expectations and managed not only to accomplish all of them, but to avercome more than enough them, and Marvel gives fans everything they have dreamed about. The only thing against this film is that it can never be equealed or overcome,
locating it on the cusp of Marvel's cinematographic world and leaving too many hight expectations for later films that, even though, we know we'll love them as they always make us do.",positive
It was amazing. The hole movie was so good a would watch it again and again. WHAT a experience,positive
"One of, if not the best superhero movies I have ever seen. A must watch!",positive
"After spending 10 years investing into a franchise such as Marvel and seeing its final product, I'd have to say it was satisfying and heartbreaking. Yes, we know future films are coming out after this, but to focus on what is at hand here is the point. It was worth going to the opening weekend show at 2am on a Friday morning. If i had to critique as being unbiased I will say it is a bit longer than needed, but when you watch it doesn't seem as though it was. Everything moved together, but for those who have seen, the time traveling can be a bit confusing to some (myself included) just because they found a way to leave some stories open for the future films. Was proud to be a part of watching wonderful experience and film!",positive
Although I knew what would happen at the end of the film ... I could not hold back my tears ... Thank you Marvel for this masterpiece.,positive
I laughed so loud I clapped with so much force and I cried so hard the movie exceeds every expectation and is the perfect culmination of the entire marvel cinematic universeAvoid spoilers as all costs !,positive
"Pretty good movie overall but pretty bad since it's the end of an awesome saga. I really like Infinity War I was disappointed by Endgame...Hulk and Thor are jokes, too much humor for a movie wich was to suppose to be the darkest, a lot of paradoxes because of the time travel.I had a good time watching it but it lets me a bitter taste in mouth..",positive
"Thought it was solid. Everything was intense as hell until that gay ass ""girl power"" scene during the final battle.",positive
"I actually like the first 40 minutes which, whilst quite slow, at least had coherent plot.After that, the whole thing because rather convoluted with disparate mini stories and occasionally contrived encounters and moments. It all just became very messy. And whilst Back to the Future was derided, that actually had a much more workable narrative. Okay, we can get it that the Quantum realm might be like that but that doesn't make it good for film. Narratively it threw up so many unanswered questions and loopholes.I liked MCU best when they kept it simple, and humorous. Iron Man was a brilliant movie. Guardians, Thor Ragnarok and (yes I'll say it) even Captain Marvel were coherent stories, well told. This was all very messy. It rather lost its way too many times.",positive
"Everyone built this movie up, telling me it was amazing. They made it sound like it was the best one ever made...but I was completely disappointed.It's was long and stretched out, they had to put things in there that didn't have any business being in there, and in the end I just felt like it was a big ball of confusion.I was very disappointed in this one and so was my husband. Infinity Wars was great LOVED it but this one wasn't great.",negative
"Everyone who is giving less than 10 is stupid , dum and can't understand this movie",positive
"I've read way too many negative reviews on here of this film so one must restore some balance. Firstly the issues. It's too long and it does not have the pace of infinity so the first hour is a struggle. I didn't agree with what they did with Thor and inevitably one or two characters are under used, Thanos, Thor, spider man. Yes, it is over sentimental but it is the finale sooo... Romanoff's death was not mourned as iron mans was which is a shame. Right, now the good bits. The fight scenes are epic particularly the last battle. Iron Man is outstanding and the star of the show in my opinion. I loved the hulk/banner cross over character and as usual the humor is solid. As finales go what more could you ask? It has an 'end'. A perfect finish to this phase. And the time machine plot is very good and they arc the previous films in beautifully. All in all this is a great ending to what has been an extraordinary anthology. Shout out to Scott Lang btw who is brilliant! Watch don't read. I AM IRON MAN 😓",positive
Graphics and climax scene is nice. But there is some what lagging in the story.so the movie is good,positive
"Some of theories that you've seen online, happens, but not really. All I can say is they done a great job and there was the epic moment, which is my favorite scene. This movie will make you laugh, happy, amaze, and having a mental breakdown at the same time.",positive
"I laughed, I cried, this is perfection... I'm still totally stunned!",positive
"After 11 years of building and development, the end of this saga finally here, and does it deliver the potential it could reach? The answer is YES. Endgame is not only one of the best superhero movies , but a great movie in general with a lot of epic and satisfying moments for fans, but also for the average marvel enjoyers who just want to disconnect from the real world for 3 hours and see a good movie. Is it a perfect movie? Absolutely not. The film leaves a lot of question marks about the time travel rules who practically is the main premise of the movie and although it does explain some questions in some ways , it's still remain kinda unclear in some moments and there are still a lot of inconsistencies that are not well explained and that kinda drag the movie down. These are mainly my problems with this film, but now let's talk about the good parts, and they are a lot. This film is very well pased, being impossible to get bored, and although following so many narrative threads,the film never feels messy, probably due to the development of all the characters in all the other years. All this leads to the last 30 minutes which are of continuous action which although it offers us some more useless moments, like the marvel women assembly, at the same time we have some of the best moments from a movie ever. Avengers endgame is probably a movie that will be talked about in another 10 years and with an emotional impact that will hardly touch you like here.",positive
"Infinity War was a solid, cohesive movie. Endgame manages to mess up everything Infinity war got right. You might say that ""It's really difficult to do such a thing with this many characters."" Infinity War had more than twice the amount of characters and was really good. Thor is no longer one of the coolest and powerful Avengers. He has been reduced to a fat, wimpy drunk. He almost killed Thanos when he had the Infinity Gauntlet but can barely touch him without. Speaking of Thanos, he has become the generic bad guy with no motive other than ""destroy the Avengers."" Captain America's send off was dissapointing, out of character, and did not follow the rules of time travel the movie had set. Why would Captain America neglect to do any super-heroing and just be with Peggy? How is it possible that he changed the future andn appeared as an old man when you cannot change the future through time travel? He should have had the heroic death Tony had, and given Tony the happily ever after. Also, did Steve just erase the husband and children Peggy had from existence? The final battle was just a bunch of CGI schlock. We could have seen all of the Avengers battle Thanos, rather than having entire armies fight the outriders. Captain Marvel may have been even worse in this movie than before, and the whole feminism message was extremely on the nose and painful to watch.",positive
To be honest this movie doesn't look like avenger. Is about family fight together. Talking about family someone should make a movie about thanos life how gamora fin her.,positive
"Some really good hype moments here and there but the movie plays out like expected. It's sadly very far from Infinity War quality, 7/10.",positive
Problem with time travel is if your not careful you make the whole plot impossible to believe. End game doesn't even come close to tieing up its loose ends. The remaining avengers act selfishly and arragently to the point you want them to fail.Thanos did nothing wrong. I hated this film.,negative
"It had everything you could ask for in a movie and more. The only genre it doesn't really touch is romance. It has the drama, the comedy, the action, the clever and often heartwarming dialogue, the personal struggles, the betrayals, fulfilling character archs that make sense (Unlike Game of Thrones), and the perfect ending to an amazing movie journey.",positive
"I never have seen any movie in life that has such a great action and awesome fantasy , I am speechless and all I can say is bravo and will done.",positive
"Finally, the culmination of 11 years, 21 films and over 80 characters, the Endgame is here, but can Marvel do the unthinkable and actually pull it off?Avengers: Endgame is the sequel to 2018's Avengers: Infinity War and follows the surviving heroes attempting to come to terms with everything they have lost and experienced as well as their plans to avenge the fallen.The film begins with a very sombre and mature outlook on our heroes. They are in mourning. They are tired. They are scared, with some having been pushed to their darkest places, all as a method to cope with the incomprehensible loss of 50% of all sentient life. This all gives the first act a ""slow"" pace. Slow in the fact that with the majority of superhero films, the opening act is exciting and action-packed, whereas with Endgame it is not. However, that's for the best as in place of action are true character moments for all involved, especially that of Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Chris Evan's Steve Rogers (Captain America), who are, arguably the main characters in this ensemble film.However, after the first act concludes, the fun begins. The plot traverses a route that is on the one hand expected and seen in many other films, but then on the other hand, perfect in the film's purpose of celebrating the last 11 years. This provides us with laughs and aids in building our heroes back up for the final act. And what a final act. Now, when people say that some movies need to be seen in cinemas, thoughts harken back to films such as Interstellar, Avatar and Titanic. The final act of Avengers: Endgame needs to be in that list. It is a site to behold. The cinematography masterfully sets the scale of events, whilst the action flows between each major character giving them time in the spotlight, allowing us to keep track of others' movements and enjoy the ride.Despite the praise I am giving this film, there are areas I disagree with. The direction a particular character goes in is a questionable one for me and is predominantly played for laughs even though if with a slightly more serious tone, it would have been impactful as well as comforting to many others. However, that is one character in about 20, meaning despite any flaws I have with the film, they are small in relation to the achievement of managing to successfully conclude a 22-film arc without it being a convoluted mess. This is due to the Russo Brothers taking a page from Guy Ritchie and balancing all plot points over a set time and then letting them collide at precisely the right moments. As such, what forms is a beautiful swansong for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that, not only respects its characters, but also respects its audience.In an ideal world, Avengers: Endgame would be the last MCU film. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Which ultimately is a shame as what we have is the finale of a TV show that has captured the hearts of millions upon millions of people and will continue to do so for generations to come. However, the series will go on, whether that is for better or worse is yet to be determined, although I would not be surprised if Avengers: Endgame marks the beginning of the end for the MCU.",positive

"Just came back from the movie theater after watching the movie. Not gonna give any spoilers or any kind of stuff that will ruin it for you after reading this. I'm just gonna say if you're a Marvel ultimate fanboy, a regular Marvel viewer, only watched Infinity War because of it's hype or just a normal movie goer that wants to watch an incredible movie it doesn't matter. This is in my opinion the pinnacle of cinema and I don't think I'm ever going to see a movie in the theaters ever again (except this movie again 2-3 more times). Just. Go. See. It.",positive
"Thank you for what Marvel has done with this movie. I cried so much. I laughed so often.Thank you for what you made with Hulk and Thor - Hulk gives so much potential to future stories, while Thor became so human and much more relatable - I think I'll get a Thor beard. Already got the hair. Love it!Thank you for giving Captain America his happy end. I bet many wanted this wonderful character to finally get back to Peggy. That long awaited kiss was a big ""Finally""!Thank you for making the movie so long. Although my bladder was about to explode, I didn't want it to end.I think this, must see before you die, movie has the impact on the fanbase many filmstudios would wish for other universes. What marvel has accomplished in just a couple years, will hopefully motivate others to create great flicks.Although this ending is awesome, I hope the fans' strong positive reactions will make Marvel consider make more movies beyond what we already know is planned.So in love with Marvel since EndGame. Best movie ever!",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is truly one of those films marketed to satisfy hardcore fans. Watching this film I truly wished that I was one of those fans and could receive the amount of satisfaction that they all seemed to have received from this.As an outsider I feel like a lot of the humor was misplaced, a lot of the action scenes were dark and hard to see, a high level of predictability to the film, a loss of logic in a few of the plot lines and a really unforgiving run time. Also given that this movie has a lot of characters in it, there really is a big difference in some of their screen time and not in a good way.Putting that all aside though there were some really good scenes, some of the jokes were hilarious and the overwhelming emotion of seeing all the Avengers from over the years finally assemble and give evil a true kick in the face was amazing to see.I would definitely recommend seeing the film to form your own opinion and I am definitely glad that the creators gave their fans exactly what they wanted in this ending, as I would like the same sense of loyalty given to me for the saga's that I am I hardcore fan of.",positive

"I honestly think that I should not make a review of the final film in what has become perhaps the most profitable movie franchise of modern history, more so seeing at how much the series of films culminating to this point, as well as this film particularly, is being cherished and loved by so many across the globe. In fact, trying to rain on the parade not only seems an exercise in futility, but also seems pointless and even, to a degree, beating a dead dog down.In short, saying anything negative about ""Endgame"" or the entire Marvel Movies franchise could perhaps, and quite possibly, only serve to attract hatred and retribution.So instead, please read this ""review"", or rather a very personal opinion without any real weight, strictly as such: an opinion. It isn't meant to drag anyone down nor point fingers or soil the viewpoints or reputations of anyone involved directly or indirectly in any way. With the internet, everyone and their opinions have a platform to express their thoughts and I just thought I'd lay my own down strictly in order to make sense of what I have just witnessed (yes, late in the game compared to real ""fans"", but I myself stopped being a ""fan"" many years ago, many movies ago).First of all, I wonder if anyone else remembers the time when on-screen visuals were something to be ""wow""-ed by. I mean with the constantly evolving technical prowess of CGI in itself, it seems as though a film with amazing visuals achieved by CGI is something of a ""given"", if not a ""standard"". Ever since the 90s when CGI started creeping into most if not all of action sci-fi blockbusters, it seems that films are becoming more of a computer-generated moving animatic rather than carefully crafted and choreographed sequences performed by, well, real people. So much so that it has become quite the standardized fare in such big set features to include a few bigger and louder than ever before seen CGI action scenes, probably pre-prepared/visualized long before casting and principal photography has begun on these productions.This rather recent ""pet-peeve"" of mine was perfectly displayed in ""Endgame""'s final huge showdown between all the Marvel shared universes characters and their recruits agains Thanos and his own resurrected forces of annihilation. Just as the first giant metallic floating eels started screeching across the screen heading towards the ""battlefield"", I consciously heard my brain saying ""well, here we go again for a big 15-25 minute exercise in screams, explosions, typical cinematic scoring and CGI melting pot which I could easily fast forward through"". I mean, again, I know that it took hundreds of people countless computer power and long hours to achieve this flawless sequence, a sheer feat of dedication and talent obviously, but to me, it had already been done countless times in this cinematic universe alone. And yes, going into a huge Avengers film does mean such sequences will be intersped across the run-time(s), but I just found myself quite bored, almost like I was subjecting myself to a beautiful work of art that is essentially both meaningless and repetitive - like another easily replaceable and disposeable set piece that is required for the formulae to work, or else the target audience will feel cheated. This is something I myself found out quite a few films prior, as I also discovered I not only was feeling increasingly disconnected with the franchise, but also subjected with an increasingly less intellectually stimulating series of characters, some of which seemed to have gotten dumber with each new instalment of these films.But as I said, the over-abundance of CGI set pieces is a pet peeve, and I am by no means a hater of all things CGI; quite the opposite as I find that many shots or sequences could simply never be achieved otherwise. I just find myself absolutely un-stimulated by these super-hero specific CGI set pieces, one reason why I pretty much stopped investing my time and money in these long ago (*)(*) So how come did I find myself watching this one if I ""hate"" superhero films so badly? Well I knew I had to watch it eventually seeing as how my wife wouldn't, watch it without me! Hey, I got her to watch The Thing (1982), the Mad max films (yes, all of them!) and most of John Carpenter's films, so it's all about compromise!Another pet peeve of mine is the run-time. Why do big budget blockbuster films feel the need to go above and beyond the 2-hour mark? Could it be because they wish to increase stock value in those ""OOops I crapped my pants"" diapers that people with over-active bladders need to use to sit through these 3-hours epics? Or could it be because the producers and board council members feel that they need to give more run-time to blockbusters because if a feature is only 90-105 minutes long, people will stay at home and binge-watch TV serials on Netflix and other streaming platforms? When a film's story and premise requires a longer run-time in order to properly develop a storyline without having jump cuts or feeling like they are rushing the plot along, I completely understand, but when a 3-hour film's essential storyline could easily have been made into a half or 2/3-sized version without the over-played CGI battle set-pieces, then it becomes a peeve of mine, especially since so many of these blockbusters (cough cough ""Bruckheimer"" cough cough) seem to overstay their welcome even before we hit the third act. In the case of ""Endgame"", there is a definite need to drive all the nails through the coffin(s) once and for all, and even the final post-climax ""goodbye"" sequences are nowhere near the sadistically elongated finales of the ""Lord Of The Rings - Return Of The King"", but I do feel as though the film would have benefitted if either cut down to a less lengthy one-piece, or even just separated as two regular-sized films. Again, this is just a general peeve of mine as I knew full-on, long before diving into this experience, that the film would require the better part of a day to watch to completion.
Another peeve I have is more towards a recent forced political perspective being carefully marketed and promoted in recent Disney productions, but is by no means fueled by any type of deep-rooted misogenistic preferences whatsoever, as I am all for (and pro) feminism and have been ever since I was able to comprehend just how women have been treated and are labelled and still to this day subjected from centuries upon centuries of propaganda and thought control methods into positions ""underneath"" that of the male of the species. Of course, just as it is difficult to justify the ""civilization"" of man based on centuries of ""civilization"" after thousands of years of pure savagery, such it difficult to break away from the pre-established decades-old (nay, centuries) repression of the female. For too many still, it is hard to break away from sexism after it has been engraved in our modern lifestyles and history lessons in the most subconscious of ways. However, I am somewhat insulted by Disney's recent ploy to target and ""empower"" the female target audience it is trying to gain through these franchises, after being (quite unfortunately) mostly predominantly very male-oriented. I mean don't get me wrong, female super heroes have as much right to be as ever-present and strong, super-powered, and self-abled as any other superhero (non-gendered extra terrestials included of course), but Disney should have included the strong female image from the start instead of seemingly forcing it in a rather non-natural fashion in the latter instalments of the films. I mean if anything, Scarlet Witch, She-Hulk, Wasp, and Black Widow should have been members of The Avengers from the very first ""creation"" in the cinematic universe, but perhaps by that time, Disney could nor foresee that having female heroes front and center from the get-go would be a better option instead of attempting to rally them all up in the last 2 or 3 final films of the franchise... Which may be why they are re-rebooting the entire series after ""Endgame"", in order to re-restart from ""scratch"" with female heroes ""8 o'clock, day one"" in the hopes to erase all previous movies and pre-established lore from then on?Again, I am really all for the female presence in any and all aspects of super-hero lore, but I personally just don't particularly enjoy the way Disney has chosen to promote this post-post feminism (which, according to old school feminists, isn't feminism nor female power at all, but that's a different discussion altogether). Like other socio-political agendas, it is being promoted quite unsubtlely and clanky, and feels like something being added in post rather than being an intergral part of a whole. But then again, this is strictly a personal observation and opinion, nothing more.I also mentioned this earlier on in my already way too lengthy ranting of an opinion here, but like all too many modern (i.e. post-Y2K of sorts) media entertainment, it feels as though the characters are being dumbed-down for the sake of an easy laugh. I mean I can understand not taking things too seriously, especially in works of fiction and even more so when it comes to stories involving ridiculous costume-wearing super-powered super-beings, but I sometimes feel I am the only one noticing that recurring characters who appear regularly in these Marvel franchise films seem to be losing IQ points with each minute added to these films' run-times. The fact that once in a while a joke is well played with perfect timing or having meta-references doesn't exclude what appears to be a more slacker-ish un-refined movement towards cheap and easy stabs at ""comedy"". At times it feels not only out of character but also out of place (depending on the circumstances) and made even more insulting is how everyone else in the scene seems to be gladly accepting and going along with what at times can only be described as ""out of order"". Is it because the",positive
"OMG! What have I just watched? Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?The last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).Bottom line, I really don't see End Game as a ""Masterpiece"" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies. It is not something we have not seen before, no breakthrough, not better than Infinity War. Just good advertising boosted this up on hall of fame scale.",negative

"As expected, the Russo brothers again made a movie in which again there are scenario holes, in which again there are big problems with logic, and in which the plot again is largely promoted due to fantastically successful coincidence of circumstances - incredible coincidences are even more incredible than in the ""Infinity War ""(here is a small example, which can hardly fully illustrate my point: how convenient it is that Thanos still wears the gauntlet and not buried it in the bowels of some abandoned planet - this particular point, unlike others, does not affect the plot as a whole, but advances it much faster than if the opponents of the violet ogre did not know the fate of the gauntlet and would notably ruffle their nerves, tormented by doubts). Well, the most important logical holes of this film come from the time travels. Changes in the past should immediately change the present, and now explain to me how you can return to the same present, from which you departed, if in the past you have have left so much traces?! .. How about the butterfly effect ?! No, haven't heard? And the poor explanation of that given in the film, is like they are trying to cover this black hole like a fig leaf, in the hope that the viewer will simply close his eyes to it, it is unconvincing and not serious from the point of view of laws and rules concerning interference with the past, which are accepted in classical fiction. And this battle of Cap with Cap, that was in the trailer? .. You know, I watched a series about half a year ago - it was called ""12 monkeys"", where the whole plot is built on time movements, and even there the scenario makers try as much as possible not to create plot holes, even there, in a low-budget series, there is such a rule that you should not meet with yourself, otherwise there will be a merge with such a spurt of energy ... Well, it turns out that the avengers are allowed to do such things. At some point, the brain gets tired of questions - how? why? from where? - and simply refuses to understand.Also, Marvel could not help giving each sister a tolerant earring. One of the cult heroes of Marvel is hiding under the skirt of strong independent women (!) ... Great! And about the captain Marvel, I have nothing to say at all. Thank God, here she is not very much. And in the film there are two moments in which, let's say, the heritage from the white person is transferred to the black man - look, and understand what it is about (the Norwegian blackres are crying from emotion).The Russo brothers made a senseless and merciless film with a swing to serious drama and gloominess (the specific Marvelian humor didn't go away - Thor, for example, turned on the fool mode from Ragnarock); having serious problems with logic; ignoring the consequences of intervening in the time continuum; with events that are implied, but not shown, why there is a constant feeling of narration rummaging (they would better make three, or even all four films instead of two with a crumpled plot, and tell the whole story thoroughly, slowly, thoughtfully, letting the viewer feel the atmosphere of the decline and despair in which the heroes live, it would be much better than what was shown here ... DC are masters to build up a gloomy atmosphere, while Marvel's work is unconvincing). And with the actors' play, too, is not everything is in order ... Here, Cap seems to be experiencing, and speaking all sorts of pretentious speeches, but the actor Chris Evans himself does not believe in it - this is evident from the barely noticeable smirk on his face ... Hulk looks rather creepy and causes ""Uncanny valley"" feeling ... About the Thor, I have already said.Yet ""The Avengers: The Finale"" is the acceptable end of the 11-year history of the MCU, as it was before - because in the future, alas, tolerant trends will rage on more and more, and in the future those who will not leave the Marvel's hypetrain , expects a line of films with a cast of all kinds of nonames, in which not talent, charisma and goodwill towards the audience, but belonging to one or another minority will be the determining factor in the approval of this or that person for the role (active planting of so called ""diversity policy"" in the next MCU phase was confirmed by Kevin Faige himself - Disney didn't get lessons from the failure of the new trilogy of the ""Star Wars"". I love the space opera - I would love to watch some good movies based on the works of E. Hamilton or A. Azimov - and therefore I will be interested in the fate of the third ""Guardians of the galaxy"", however, other movies by Marvel, alas, are not so interesting to me. And if suddenly I want to look at asian Kung-Fuists , I'd better see good old movies with Jackie. Or with Jet.Returning to our sheep, ogres, raccoons, cyborgs and other living creatures, I would add: I really liked only the very ending of the film. The rest things are something mechanistically soulles, in which you do not believe, something ... secondary relative to the original films, the events of which the heroes attend.",positive

Doesn't measure up to Infinity wars and has too many plot holes. is not that bad but i was expecting way more than what we got is like many promises were broken on this one.,positive
"This is the most poorly written of all the Avengers movies. It is action scene after action science with a few lines and a great deal of flashbacks to original Marvel Superhero films. This is the worst time travel movie I have ever viewed. TV Shows such as Outlander and Game of Thrones deal with time travel and flash backs respectively. This movie could have had an hour of superfluous action removed and more money could have been utilized for writers to make the story more concise and give us a chance to say goodbye to our favorite Marvel superheroes. In addition, the costumes were cheesy and as I viewed the film in IMAX I noticed that the costumes didn't fit the characters well. For example, the most ubiquitous costume problem was that their boots appeared to be two sizes too big. The sets were not convincing while the cinematographer would show the whole set then zoom in on a character's oversized boots. By the time, the war with Thanos began during the last 45 minutes it was total chaos with Tony Stark martyring himself for all Avengers and humanity. The writing, in the end, failed to unify all the films. I hoped the writers could pull together the twenty two film collection with a solid introduction, body, and conclusion. The end product was too much action, very little dialogue (except boring hazing), cheesy costumes, poor sets, too many character's whose fate was unclear.",negative

"Endgame is a love letter to MCU with humour, drama, fan service, nostalgia, and coolness in one epic proportion. Film time is 3 hours with a fantastic flow building up to the finale. Arguably the canvas combined 4 genre episodes into one final product with great success (Drama, Heist, Action, War). First part of the movie is character building, introducing new roles, and setting the plot. RDJ and SJ delivered a strong performance which adds body and foundation to the film. Momentum to the plot circles around the idea of time heist. Russo brothers' taking a leaf out of a catalog of heist movies like Ocean 11 & Italian Job to create some light tempo and humourous entertainment in gearIng up the film. (Noticeably minimal superpowers were used and RDJ haven't suit up once to this stage). The direction follows the magic rat-pack formula of smooth transitioning in narrating the plan, crafting up the traps, triggering the execution, and double jeopardy twists sprinkled with some dramatic scenes. There are plenty of cameos referencing this large soap opera of prequels to draw up emotions and nostalgia moments from the decades of cult following. The plot set us up with our heroes encountering head on with the ultimate villain. Queue fast combat action, flying moves, and a few easter egg surprises for the comic book fans. The audience is now hit with a massive dose of adrenaline and satisfaction from the rollercoaster ride of action sequences and stunning CGI visual effects. Just when our inner fanatics is fist pumping on the edge of our seats. The movie elevated to brand new heights, no other superhero movies have ever reached. All the superheroes, sidekicks, villains, and adversaries came out of nowhere for a centrepage scene and we are now ready for war. My investment of time growing up with comic books and 21 movies over 11 years are paid off handsomely in this one picture perfect moment. This is the ultimate finale and I really don't want it to end. The film served up a few more poster scenes and references to current political climate. Our heroes tag teaming literally on the home run. It delivers one last dramatic twist to signal the end of an era. The directors did a great job in tying up the loose ends and properly closed the chapter on this saga and the fate of our beloved superheroes. I waited through the end credits to find there are no secret scenes. This little detail literally provide closure to a decade of storytelling. Endgame is a superbly executed and extremely enjoyable blockbuster. Russo over delivered all the areas of expectations leading up to this last infinity gauntlet chapter. Marvel are used to collaborating great crossover sagas in the world of comic books. It is an audacious achievement in delivering this feat in 22 cinematic experiences where no others have done before. Endgame have set the bar high and GoT has a lot to live up to next week. I do hope they leave the Avengers as it is and don't recast them for generations to come. This is a tribute to the actors we associated with so much and they are now a symbol of the role. It is a beginning of a new chapter and can't wait for the next great Marvel story to be told.",positive

What I also have to admit is that its not easy to make a 3-hour-action-movie not feel like a 3-hour-action-movie with correctly balanced audio-visual dynamics.Remaining Avengers have to travel in time and try to fix what they couldn't prevent in the past.",positive

"This is a movie where one term could be used to describe it, and that term is ""tedium."" I've always had a begrudging attitude towards Avengers movies because, as with a lot of entries in the MCU, it's a lot of scientific nonsense with the action thrown in as an afterthought in order to justify its existence as a superhero movie. But I thought I would give Endgame a fair chance. After all, having all those superheroes on one screen should be fun, action packed, and entertaining, right? Wrong.I cannot express how terrible this film was. The two redeemable parts were Tony Stark's daughter and Ant-Man. They were the only entertaining parts of the film. I pay money to see movies that are entertaining, not ones that are so full of characters that you get lost.There are a lot of reasons that I hated this movie, but I'm going to focus on two in particular here: the story and the action, or rather, the lack of action. First, the story. This entire film was built around a needlessly complicated plot surrounding time travel, even though the time travel was completely pointless in the first place. Bruce Banner says, point blank, that traveling back into the past won't change the future. So, why do you do it, then? Why on Earth would you commit to such an exercise in complete futility? I'll tell you why, because you need more science fodder for all the Marvel super fans, so that they can leave the theater and point at someone who looks confused and feel superior.Everything was poorly written in this movie. When your forced obscenities are being spouted from the mouths of the people you're supposed to cheer for, while your villain speaks in Shakespearean soliloquies, then you've clearly gone completely wrong with your script. Also, the part where Stark's daughter swears and we were supposed to find it cute? Yeah, I didn't. I found it grossly inappropriate and wrong to show a 4 or 5 year old child in such a manner. It wasn't innocent and sweet, it was rather demented. Meanwhile, Thanos speaks in these long, grandiloquent speeches that never seem to have an end. It was all just one big pile of dreck.Thanos was another problem I had with this film. His motivations were never properly spelled out. They tried, but they failed rather miserably. It seemed like he just wanted to destroy the world because it was ripe for the taking, I guess? I don't know. He was weird as well, because he said he was going to build another universe, but he seemed to have a nihilistic outlook on everything, so that would mean his other universe would be completely pointless. Anyway, it was really terrible.But this movie's main sin was its lack of action through the first two-thirds, and the fact that it hardly showed the Avengers doing anything heroic. They never stopped a bank robbery, they never helped an assault victim, all they did was do their pointless time travel stuff to attempt to stop Thanos, even though Bruce said it would be completely futile to do so. The movie couldn't get out of its own way and it suffered because of it.Then the last third was all action and it blew my mind, but not in a good way. I left the theater with a physical headache due to the poor pacing and cinematography on the final battle sequences. They were overly long, started and stopped way too many times, and attempted to tie up every loose end from the entire MCU in one big bang. It was just terrible! You have to allow things to flow, and this movie didn't flow at all.A movie that was boring, poorly paced, poorly written, and just a terrible excuse for film definitely deserves a spot on my worst of 2019 list. Hopefully, Toy Story 4 makes up for it!",negative

"As a person grow up with marvel studio's products, this film hits differently than any others.All these years of consuming super hero movies. We couldn't help but notice that the structure of a super hero movies is simple and effective. Normal person, normal person discover his power, introduce a villian with obvious immorality, hero sacrifices to save the world, the whole process is about a normal person's divinity ascending. This structure appears all over the history of literature. And Endgame took this singular structure extremely well in the most classic and beatiful way. That's how the movie works:We see, everyone except ironman in the team took the opposite route, their divinity decreases as the movies goes on, they come from heros to humans. While ironman is the only one who gain divinity when the movie ends. He was introduced as a human with a family, he discover time travel (discover power), then Thanos was introduced as a classic villian (acts on personal reasons but not on something that can be justified), then ironman sacrificed himself, a sacrification makes a hero.Why is this important? Because this is a perfect closure for not only the Marvel studio products, but also for the big scale super hero movie tide that lasted for more than 10 years (this is a very big cutural phenomenon in our time). While all the super hero titled movies try new ways, try to break the old formula, this movie, however, has the gut to embrace it. This may just seems like a simple chose, but it actually has more power influence, for now the classic superhero narrative is more than our shallow entertainment products, the classic superhero structure now has its own cultural deposits, this narrative now leaves a deep mark, a monument on our modern entertainment history that we won't forget . A film that can take the classic formula and end 10 years of cumulation, which will inevitably makes Endgame the epitome and peak of classic superhero films, and of course the very closure of classic superhero films, for no classic superhero film will be able to duplicate Endgame's influence and legacies.",positive
"As the continuation of the ""Avangers: Infinity War"" movie, this film was successful to make the audience feel very curious about the end of the story. This film tests whether you are really Marvelous or not. When you watch this film, you will feel every second of this film is a pity to miss. Three hours duration of this film feels nothing for me, even I wish it could be a little longer.A continuous story from previous films makes this film very interesting to watch and also difficult to predict the end of this film. Anyone who might miss the previous Marvel films related to this film might not understand the parts related to this ""Avengers: Endgame"" film. I think the camera and sound effects is perfect. Each of actor and artist successfully plays the hero character entrusted to them very well.A good teamwork is very highlighted in this film. This film teaches that the optimism in achieving a goal, even though it must pass a big challenge. When I watch this film, I feel touched by the struggle and the sacrifice made by the team. Every scene from this film has its own meaning, even It's not hesitate to shed tears for some sad scenes. I want to watch this movie again and again because i just want to say that this is one of the best Marvel films. If possible, I want to give 11/10 rate for this amazing film.",positive

Captain Marvel coming into low earth orbit and Thanos ships guns refocusing on this powerful new threat had my thinkin ""OH BOY!!"" then her no selling that barrage of laser/cannon fire and wrecking his ship was BADA## I mean yes Thanos got in a couple lucky shots but he could not damage/hurt her...go Cap!!!! Very cool when Tony ""shifted"" the stones to his glove,did not see that coming...neither did Thanos!! All in all gave it a 6 because of fat Thor and weak Hulk...yes I saw it twice.",positive
"Definitely it landed in my best movie lists. It's first time i rated 10 for any movie but this movie brings all.

Proper ending like we want to see for our 10 years of waiting.
Please run for it, because destiny arrives and it's waiting for you.",positive
"I'll keep this simple.It's nowhere near as good as Infinity Wars.The whole time travel aspect was poorly executed, it was very predictable and Captain Marvel's involvement was a bit ridiculous (I could easily help you win, but I'm busy so I'll be back in 2.5 hours).It's a fun watch, but that's about it.",positive
"Josh Brolin's voice was totally wrong for Thanos. The lips didn't even match the words. I'm also just tired of seeing the SAME old mad man trying to destroy the world and getting defeated by super heroes. Too many characters.At least with the Dark Knight and some of the X-Men films they mixed it up and felt fresh. More superheroes doesn't mean better. Plus the acting was atrocious. The wooden repartee didn't help, done only to make sure everyone gets their lines in.Try a new storyline and/or approach. SKIP IT!",negative

"Imagine you have to write Endgame. You would have to find a way to reconcile several things: the expectations of the audience, the continuity not only with the other movies, but with future projects and past comic book ideas, the actors that just won't come back whatever the reason, America's unhealthy obsession with political correctness, the wishes of the producers, the wishes of the director, the wishes of the people paying for the movie. It is an nearly impossible task. As a solution to this conundrum, Avengers: Endgame was really decent. It has character build up, exposition - maybe too much of it, foreshadowing, great action scenes, great emotional scenes, great acting. It got rid of all the leaving actors in a very nice way for their characters. It solved the problem of the death of so many living creatures in a way that didn't mean everything was simply undone or redone or forgotten.That being said, all the characters in this film are dumb. I mean, really dumb. They have lightning fast reactions, but their solutions are ridiculous. The whole concept of the solution, which I don't want to spoil, lends itself to improvement.; it was not spent in this story. Also, there is a key moment that ends (heh) it all... it could have been done minutes before. All the elements where already there. And there are so many logic holes in the plot that my mind just reels from thinking about it.Bottom line: a very beautiful film for your heart. Doesn't do your brain any good.",positive

This is one of those rare movies that it seems pointless to write a review because its so good. In fact its so good finding something to criticize here will only make you look petty.,positive
"So let me start of by saying that the movie was good.
But it was not as good as Infinity war.
The movie starts off very instant and with no real lead to the previous one.
It also has a very slow build up i mean literally nothing happens for 75% of the movie.
I wish they would have made more happen during that 3/4 were as in infinity war they had stuff happen all the time from start to finnish.I can also add that cm was absolutely not needed for this movie.Pretty bad review i know but that's my honest opinion and a rightful one.
People praising this movie to the stars are blinded for sure.It's a good movie in the sense that it's watchable and has some fun and good times mostly with Thor and then a goodbye that leaves you with tears.But nothing compared to Infinity war.7/10 stars while i would have given infinity war 9/10.",positive

"There are a lot of words to describe this movie, but dull isn't one of them. If you don't like a character then you will love them by the end. While Captain Marvel dont have a lot of screen time she certainly has the most influence characters. Some characters are rounded off and some are open.
The choice of not having a post credit scene is a good one as it showes that this is an end. The post credit scene left the movie open and for you to explore. The voice of not having one shows this as the end. If 'far from home' wasn't coming out then it would show 'the end' of the mcu.",positive
"Avengers endgame is a movie that lives to the hype with a story that uses its 3 hour runtime well and has so many emotional moments that hit well, an amazing final battle that is so awesome and epic, great performances from everyone, phenomenal visuals, an ending that is satisfying, and has hilarious comedy.

"Just got back from a matinee of ""Avengers: Endgame""(2019). In short, a spectacular, satisfying and enjoyable finale to the Marvel Universe movie series. They hit so many ""right"" notes and gave the characters their respect and moments and manage to fit in so much material coherently in one movie. Without giving anything away, the final scene is just so right and the whipped cream and sprinkles on the sundae.
My only real gripe? (drum roll), some of the action. That hyper-shot, dizzying camera moves and hyper editing style that I've come to despise in the last 20 years. A big screen Xbox game with a 6 year old at the control, who has ADD! I think some of the action in other Marvel Universe movies was shot and edited better.
Having said that, this entry is right at the top of the summit of the super hero genre and should make a quadrillion dollars at the box office.",positive
"Although it was a satisfying ending of the same characters in MCU, other important protagonists get sidelined in ridiculous ways. The ending was very emotional, but the road there was a bumpy one. The Russo's did not capture the magic they did with Infinity War, but I guess it was good enough.",positive
I Always Give Stuff 10 Stars Sometimes But This Is Amazing One Of The Best Movies Ever Created The Ending Will Make You Cry With Lots Of Action Time Traveling Comedy And More This Is Already A Classic And Will Still Be In 25 Years Amazing I Love It 3000.,positive
"As the title states. The climax of this film is the most important part. Something the whole previous 2 and a half hours builds up to. To have it spoiled by an all powerful character, who can just swoop in and destroy whole spaceships, takes away all the suspense and hence, in my opinion, all the fun.There is a reason even superheroes are flawed. Even they struggle and fail. It's to allow us to identify with them.I loved Infinity War, but this I will not see again.",positive
"How can we take insignificant uninteresting stuff and make it awesome stuff because this flick has loads of characters and you may or may not like the premise of the jeweled glove and having to stop Thanos' destruction. Do you like that premise? To make awesome from awesome is something but un awesome into awesome something else to do. First the bad is it has too much melodrama with faces filling the screen in different emotive expressions to bring more ""important"" to everything. It's like the Looney Tunes episode of opera singing with Bugs, Elmer Fudd, wearing helmets with little wings, and a fat white horse, the type that of helmet that Thor wears too. Never into this episode because I like FUN. Or like the symbol of acting, the frowning face and the smiling face so I get there's an audience for this that I'm not for. The other thing is referencing other movies in here. Some of the references people might not even like, numerous time traveling flicks mentioned, Hot Tub Time Machine, Terminator, BTTFuture, Time Cop, Bill and Ted, even in Cap: Civil War I recall Empire Strikes Back which I thought the same thing but didn't think there would be way more in this movie by the makers, as some may not even like some of those movies. This isn't a tv show, but a movie, it sounds like something people you're around would say, not actual characters in the movie. Thirdly there's too much sentimental domestic stuff rearing itself with too much ""family"" shyt , little kid crap, YAWN. This was a problem in Captain Marvel in the mid part in some shack remeeting an over emoting lady friend and her tyke, I was expecting Cap Marvel to present some tampons to her to ease her, or even the Skrulls wearing sweaters to make it cuter. These are space warriors in the comics, for Pete sakes. This is off the top of my head. In Endgame what I'm talking about is perfectly shown in one scene out of nowhere this happens: this guy is sitting on a front porch (I get he's from Iron Man but others may not have seen that) and his tyke says she wants cheeseburgers. ""You can have all the cheeseburgers you want, cheeseburgers, all of them,"" paraphrased, while spacing out having a sedated appearance, and this just cuts to another different scene. What the?!?!?? Geezers sitting on front porches, thanks movie. This encapsulates why this domesticated crap is crap.Now the good stuff is this is funny af (af acronym was actually on some billboard recently kid you not) moments from Thor, a delightful chap, who's taken the spotlight a lot recently after being in the shadow in the early MCU, the opening scenes from Guardians is reshown from a diff perspective of like Starlord doing the same walkman listening and miming motions while the current superheroes spying on him hilariously. The revisiting of other Marvel movie scenes kind of work like from Thor: Dark World, Avengers 1, Cap: Winter Soldier. Dark World domestic scene works because it's around palace intrigue and I like the vibrance of that movie being the first MCU movie I saw. And also the elevator scene from Winter Soldier is reduxed in a funny way, and the Battle of NY from Avengers 1 also. The other thing is a fight sequence between Thor, Cap, Iron Man against Thanos which is impressive wow. It's here that it also shines. I think these other MCU scenes with a different spin are kinda cool, although I would have liked just to introduce its own thing this movie. I mean you don't see in Avengers 1 them resisting scenes from their solo movies. I know that they want to get this Thanos storyline out of the way though naturally and the whole story is just like the comics pretty much verbatim. Personally I'm ambivalent about that storyline frankly. I actually appreciate the movies that takes an insignificant plot and make something out of it.But you know the good thing is these movies present loads of interviews, panel conferences, and those global cast events that are so entertaining to watch so ti's a win win. Wondering what is the key to happiness for all of those in those interviews. In Fractured Fairytales they say ""the happiest people are busy people"" but that's not quite, it's those who value their masculine and feminine (guys former and women latter obv.) It seems the doorways just open for those type of people, and the busy people-an illusion. I've worked so much and study and the doorways , are they flying open. It's these in these interviews, Scarlett who knows how to be feminine, Brie has a slight masculine to her and you see why people are like what the?? Cap Marvel movie people are not taken with that, it takes place like 2 decades ago and now men have to sit in theater who were around then and have to watch this smarmy lady onscreen, what does this tell you. Gwyneth Paltrow is another masculine, why is she here, the song in stores ""turn your magic on/I feel alive again"", you like that? She was with that guy until he's like no I don't want to deal with this masculine person I just want to make more songs forget this. I don't know the correlation between busy and this m/f thing I just know if you are too much in one it's OK to balance it out with the other thing to keep fun. I j/o every other day. Anyway so the movie has Thor hammer it up, Hulk smashes, Hawkeye lays some serious deep stick arrow, Black Widow looks spiderific, Iron Man unleashes blasts, and Cap just goes in raw.",negative
"Avengers end game was like a thanks giving turkey, the movie statisfy all of the movie fans like what kind of thing will people see and enjoy those elements were present in this movie in a tremendous manner.I like most is this has lots of other things than the fight sequence, when putting all the super heroes one place most probably there will always we lots of fights sequences but in this movie we have everything that's the special",positive

"The action is massive, the cast huge, the scope in size is bigger than ever, but most importantly the emotions are deep and rich. Because of where Infinity war left, we get to see our characters in this world in a very different place and that provides all of our actors to emote in new and deep ways. Beyond that the Russos take certain characters in some bold and new directions and they're still taking risks this late into the game. Where Infinity war spread the spotlight throughout almost the entire MCU, Endgame trims down the cast to primarily just the original Avengers plus some additions, so everyone gets a full charater arc htroughout the entire film. Throughout the story they are able to squeeze in a bunch of plotlines that we've seen throughout the franchise thus far, and it all leads up to the slam-bang finale that somehow manages to top both the airport sequence as well as the battle of Wakanda. And as you move into the last 15 minutes of the film they manage to successfully close out this era of the MCU. In closing you feel satisfied and you think to yourself: This is a pretty MARVELous conclusion.",positive
"Where do you begin with this film? I doubt there's that many people who turn up to the cinema (or pick out a random DVD etc) and see a film called 'Avengers: Endgame' and decide to watch it without really knowing anything about it. Basically, it's the finale to a series of 21 (I think!) films which have spanned over an eleven year period. So, do you need to watch all those films before watching 'Endgame?' No. But it sure helps!However, to give the most briefest of summaries, 'Avengers: Endgame' is a superhero movie where Earth's mightiest heroes come together to right the wrongs of a bad purple dude called 'Thanos' who has only gone and wiped out exactly 50% of the universe by collecting a load of magic (on 'infinity' to give them their proper name) stones and then putting him in his equally magic glove and snap his fingers to achieve this feat. Luckily, Earth still has enough heroes left to stop him.If - and I find this hard to believe - you have never watched anything that has come before it, you may just about get what's going on. There are battles, shocks, surprises, plenty of action and computer-generated characters in crazy worlds and locations. So it's fun. But I think that's a severe minority who will view it like that. For the rest of us - particularly people like me who have been following the franchise from the very beginning - will see it through completely different eyes. We will get every last reference and portion of 'fan service' (and there is plenty of that).I won't go into details because this could well be the biggest cinematic/filmic event to date. Franchises like 'James Bond' may have had more installments, but they were individual stories and didn't all link up and come together in one almighty conclusion. So this is the longest-running story ever on film (yes, I know you can probably watch the previous entries on their own and understand them as one-offs). In contains all the endings you'll need for your favourite characters, such as Thor, Iron Man and Captain America. All three superheroes are played - as usual - to perfection by Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. If you've followed these characters since the beginning, you won't fail to be moved by watching their various conclusions.I loved it, but it's not without it's flaws. It's worth noting that it's over three hours long and, for all its fan service, it does tend to drag in one or two areas. Plus it's quite 'exposition heavy' meaning characters have to explain the 'science' of various fantastical events for us - the audience - to properly understand the ways they're going to dig themselves out of such a hole as restoring the other half of the universe's population.However, if you've watched the majority of what's come before 'Endgame' then you'll probably sit through this and enjoy it to various levels. I've seen plenty other reviews and most - if not all - have been positive about the film. I don't know where the MCU (or 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' to be correct) will go from here. I'm sure it'll be good, but - for some reason - I just can't see it ever living up to the hype and novelty of this first 'phase' of the overall story.Oh, and for those who weren't too taken with Brie Larson's 'Captain Marvel' character - don't worry - she's not in it that much.https://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.com/",positive

"The good: how strange it is, that this movie is one of the biggest action blockbusters in history, but the acting performances in it are still really good! Tilda Swinton and Robert Redford, to name a few supporting actors, are starring in it! That's ludicrous. Those actors never star in these kind of movies. But they do, now. Therefore the biggest gift of this Avenger movie are the ACTOR'S. It's an actor's movie!The bad: it lasts WAY TOO LONG. 3 hours! What were they thinking? I got bored halfway through this story. The story is completely silly, although the dialogues are still very good. There is more bad: lots of SILLY special effects. I mean, come on, with SO much money available they could at least have come up with more credible looking special effects and sets, but they didnt.Conclusion: nice, mindless fun, with great actors. Too bad the story is so silly and lasts way too long...",positive
"It's just a masterpiece, everything is looking pretty good!",positive
"In all honesty I enjoyed Endgame more than Infinity War, which gave me a headache when I watched it last year.
The performances here are quite good, with RDJ, Johansson, Evans and Hemsworth at their very best. The cinematography and visual effects are, of course, fantastic. The effects of Infinity War events on the different characters was cool to watch, and their dynamics and interactions together were quite good too. The ending was quite powerful, and a poetic end to an era, with the heroic sacrifices of Iron Man and Black Widow.
However, the movie was WAY too long and dragged a lot in the middle. Some parts could have easily been shortened or edited out completely without affecting the story line. Also, some of the plot points and details of the story are very complicated and difficult to keep up with or understand without asking a hundred questions.
All in all, while a half-time break is necessary, Endgame was a satisfying and powerful end to this important era of the MCU.",positive
So i just watched it for the second time yesterday and i have to be honest this movie is boring as hell until the final fight and now that I watched it for the second time the final fight was ok this movie is so overated in my eyes firat time i watched it i was nearly falling asleep in theater because nothing intersting was happenning people going to hate me for this but I dont care I had more fun watching Dark Phonenix then this boring ass movie mcu movies are so overated in my opinion!,negative

"There are some very good moments in Endgame and that's coming from a long standing MCU fan growing up with these movies. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much. Entry of Captain Marvel Was The Worst Part of the Movie , Billions of Miles Away From Earth , She Finds Tony And Nebula Brings them Back to Earth With Her Super Power , Wasted potential of Capt Marvel - why introduce a character so powerful, and then not use them for >95% of the movie? She was in the movie for like For 5 minutes.. for 3 hours movie . Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.These movie Will Not Convince Most of The MCU Fan's because its not done Right in 3 hours of the movie you can just enjoy 1 hour rest 2 hours are mediocre , this is most disappointing Avenger Movie. Max Rating is 6.5 /10",positive
"Disney ruins what could have been otherwise a PERFECT cinematic finale for a decade of great films with that one forced feministic scene. You know which one.
This is why; lets rewind back to the first Avengers movie to the scene when the whole team is gathering preparing for battle; THAT CLASSIC SCENE that was in every trailer and promotional material, we saw all the avengers being ""assembled"", males and female getting ready for a stand in battle, then we saw a second ""assemble"" in Age Of Ultron, the a third one in Civil War, now lets jump to this new scene.... where are all the males?
wouldn't have been double ""cool"" if we saw all of our heroes females and males homaging that first movie scene showing off how much the group has grew since then?
What was the reasoning; story wise, behind the female characters for doing that specially in the middle of a fight?
Instead of bringing together the two genders as EQUALS, DISNEY decided to split them and chose the females over the male ones, ""for reasons"", and now the movie will be terrible dated.
On the topic of gender issues in media a wise celebrity once said: ""Swap all the genders of the characters in that movie, if their actions look bad now then that is NOT equality""
Nothing can be perfect; just like with The Lord Of The Rings The Return Of The King; another great epic finale for a film series, the movie could have been without that infamous Legolas vs. Elephant scene.
An even bigger crime is that nowhere is a dedication or in memory to Stan Lee to be found nor before nor after the credits. Why?",positive
"The movie most disappointed.
Boring but exciting in other moments. I've expecting receive an epic and amazing ending after 22 movies. But. I just received and screenplay with black hole that eat the logic and congruence. I'm disappointed. Furious.I want to see a marvelous movie. But, why? Why marvel? You made a movie full of no logic just completely made for fan service. Is just a mixture of back to the future, and other moves referenced in.Was good. Not epic.
Was bad. Not terrible.Unfunny. The jokes don't made me laugh. But see all superheroes in screen was emotional and right. Some minutes were boring and useless. Some characters were wasted.",positive
"I always thought it was going to be almost impossible to improve on Infinity War... and I think I've been proved right.
This was always going to be a film all about how the good guys could return to winning ways after getting their proverbial @as kicked in infinity war.
Yes we probably wanted to see some of the aftermath of half the universe being wiped out....but it didn't need to play out for so long.
To be honest I dislike most films when time travel becomes involved...I just think it all becomes a bit ""well nothing really matters as we'll just go back in time and change it"".
I've watched infinity war 8 times already... but i just can't imagine ever sitting through this that many times.
My honest opinion is it's too long....some of the main characters are just either disappointing or none existent.
Another issue..if you have a character as powerful as Captain Marvel the rest of the squad become a bit redundant...unless you a again decide to send her to the other side of the universe.
Some people will kid themselves that this is the peak of the whole journey.....its not...it already happened in infinity war.",negative

"Huge spoilers.Except for Doctor Who, I hate time travel. That is mostly because too many stories use it to undo things, which is fraught with peril both to the characters and to the writing. Paradoxes are inevitable. So, one of my biggest complaints consistently about Marvel is that the writers don't stick to their own rules, or any rules. Magical things happen and there is no explanation or cost.In this movie, the heroes spend a fair amount of screen time and angst explaining that you can't change the past. It is explained as if to say that ultimately it can't be done. This was by no means a small point in the story. So what does the story do? It changes things. Not the least of which is Captain America. And more to the point of the story, Thanos' history completely changes. (And how did he get that huge ship with thousands upon thousands of creatures through time?) Gamora's history also changes. And Nebula faces off with herself - that doesn't change time? In the present the three changed things and then none of them were there to do the things they did in the past, so the present should never happen. I hate time travel.Also, there are at least three major love stories set up in Infinity War. The threads continue, at least to some extent, in this movie. And at least two of them crash and burn. While that is not necessarily a writing flaw, it doesn't make me happy. Of the three, I'm not even counting Jane. Why did her love story disappear?So why did I really enjoy this movie? For one thing, the final conflict was awesome even if it was completely over the top. Another reason is that for 2 hours or more, there was a story with multiple threads. There was acting. There was humor. (I often think that Marvel humor is trite because they mix humor and tragedy with so little boundry, but in this movie, the humor was quicker and I don't know why, just better.) I loved big Hulk and fat Thor among other things.Other nitpicks: My first thought when the team lined up to go back in time, lamenting there was only one chance each, was - why don't you go grab some more formulas from Hank first? I think the writers masked this problem a little anyway given they had to save some for returning the stones later. Turns out I was right, but they just hadn't thought of getting it from Hank, YET.I didn't think the movie made it clear why Gamora didn't stick around for Quill. It was there, but you really have to think about it. My friend and I discussed it afterward and I didn't figure it out for a day. (She disappeared with Thanos when Stark snapped his fingers because she came through time to get there. And lest you say that explains my earlier complaint about her and Thanos changing their history, this still doesn't cover it because they still changed things before they poofed.Others have complained about Captain Marvel's inconsistencies and disappearence. She tries to explain that there are other problems in the universe. But as one Avenger responds as she disappears, the mess left by Thanos is the biggest problem and it affects the whole universe. Clearly, her more timely help would have made things far less uncertain. (And that's why the writers had to banish her for much of the movie - drama. It's a reason, just not one that justifies the way it's written.)So basically, my conclusion is - give me a fun, exciting story with good action and graphics (and some romance helps) and I might ignore the plot holes.",positive
"The Set-upThe Time Travel plot device to end the Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been speculated ever since the post-credits scene from Ant-Man and the Wasp showed Scott Lang/Ant-Man getting trapped in the Quantum Realm.Any time you use Time Travel as a plot device in a movie, it raises a LOT of questions on how paradoxes are avoided. BUT this is a Marvel movie, so we wave our Sorcerer Supreme hands and ignore things that would be scrutinized in a hard science fiction film.So. Three acts.First Act: The StakesTo me this was the best part of the whole movie. We visit with the original Avengers, first a few days after the events of Infinity War, then again five years later to see how they're dealing with their losses. This is the difference between the MCU and the DCEU - the MCU spends time with the characters' motivations and the stakes involved. When they fight not just another meaningless CGI-laden battle. This act ends with the return of Scott Lang and the formulation of the plan to recover the people Thanos killed in Infinity War.Second Act: The HeistsIt's fitting that Ant-Man triggers this series of events, because this act feels like the original Ant-Man movie. Still a lot of nice interaction between the surviving heroes, and the environments that they visit. The act ends when they all succeed, but at what price?Third Act: The EndgameOf course there's a final battle to end the movie and the current Phase of the MCU, complete with transitions, consequences, surprises and all-out CGI action as only the Russos can deliver. It's a totally satisfying climactic encounter.EpiloguePeriods and question marks for the characters that we've journeyed with for twenty-two films.Post-credits scenesThere aren't any. Unless you count a post-credits sound effect, which could mean anything.Reviewer's Tilt7/10. Unfortunately I think about time travel plot holes too much, and this impacts how much I enjoyed the movie, so I docked it a point for that, but it's still a solid entry and a worthwhile end to this Phase of the MCU.",positive
"Just perfect.The storyline is amazing and especially how they connected it with the Infinity War.It creates strong feelings.How the story is evolving with the plot twists and all that makes a perfect development.And of course the effects,the sound e.t.c is awesome too.Definetely a must-watch movie.",positive
"First of all, from a critics perspective, the movie had everything to be a complete success. The visuals were amazing, the soundtrack was a perfect underline to every scene and the plot contained several unexpected twists. However, the movie just didn't do it for me personally.Before I start complaining, I went in that movie with high expactations, due to it being the grand finale to an 11 years ongoing era, but was open for everything to happen.Except for just enough things that made me feel like it wasn't the finale I wished to see.Starting with the attack on Thanos in the first part of the movie. It was too fast and too easy to be the follow up of Infinity War. Thanos killed our beloved characters but the revenge for it just wasn't satisfiying and felt like they want to get rid of him as fast as possible just to bring his former conquerer self on screen to have a villain to fight.
It was surprising, but it wasn't a good surprise.Second, the humour felt kinda off. Don't get me wrong, the jokes were great and I laughed at some of them, but often they were misplaced. For such a serious situation, there were to many jokes.
Fat Thor was hilarious, but I would have liked this in the probably upcoming Asguardians of the galaxy movie, where they just chill in space and get fat, but not in the finale of an era.The solution for defeating Thanos, undo the snap and what they had to do for it were just to easy. I never had the feeling, that they were risking something. For every problem, there was a fast solution. There wasn't a moment where the stakes were high. It felt like ""yeah just do it"".Additionally, I think the Russo brothers went full safe mode with the happenings. Everything the fans wanted to see was in it. Wich sounds great, but there wasn't any real surprise. It felt like I knew exactly what will happen next and how the movie ends (just a note here: I tried to avoid any trailers or theories, so I went in that movie only with my own thoughts about it). It was indeed a good storyline, but way to predictable.Also, the movie was slow paced, but the important scenes, for example the comeback of all characters at the final battle, did not have enough time to breathe. There was so much happening at that battle, that every reunion was so fast and rushed. More time for it would have made it more emotional.These are just a few things that bothered me. Nevertheless there are a lot of good things as well.The movie took its time to have as much of a goodbye to the characters as possible.
The chemistry between the characters was on point.
The timetravels to the old movies were a great recap of what happened.
Tony's death and the funeral were emotional as hell.Overall, the movie just isn't the worthy finale for an unbelievebly well made cinematic universe. It did everything to be a good ending but lacked the surprises as a consequence. It is a must watch for fans, but as a movie itself it is by far not as good as Infinity War.",positive
"Thor is playing Fortnite. Thats all what is cool at Avengers Endgame. And it has been shot very well: colours are good, effects are good but Captain Marvel is annoying me",negative
"No Matter How Great The Ending Is, We all Feel Sad About the Ending..!
I was a 9 Year Old Kid when it all Started, Became Huge Fan after Avengers 1, and Now when its all ended i want it to start Over..!
Overall Summary of the Movie is that , it was everything you want it to be and way above than our Expectations..!
I am Eternally Gratefull for this Journey..!❤",positive
"If you're going for the Avengers film to expect action, Endgame may disappoint you a bit. It's not as packed with action as some of the other MCU & Avengers movies are. However, it does have a good storyline. It just seems a bit slower in the first half. Now many do say that plot development is crucial too. People need to relate to it emotionally. And that completely valid and I agree with them. However, there are times where the plot development seems way too long winded.
Regardless, this was the Finale and it stood up too its expectations. So all in all a great movie!",positive
I can introduce this movie to one of the best marvelstudios films. This is movie really masterpiece!!! I rated this 10/10!,positive
"So, an era has ended. It began with Iron Man in 2008 and now the story of the Avengers has come to an end. There will be Marvel movies after this one. Spider-Man: Far from Home is coming out this very summer. But in a very real sense this is an end to that initial line-up. I even wonder if we're going to have Avengers 5.The story picks up a few weeks after The Snap. Thanos has won and half of all living creatures in the universe have been dusted. Bleak times for everybody. But, after some hard times and setbacks, a new plan emerges. A bold plan. A crazy plan. A plan unlike any other.The film works. It pays homage to the previous 21 films and the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. It finds a way to give respect to all the great things that have led us to this point, while still working as a standalone film. Not that you should see this film on its own. This is very much the culmination of a saga. It's not required to have seen all of MCU before seeing this one, but it sure does help. A lot.Furthermore, it's much more fulfilling to watch this movie as a diehard Marvel fan. It's a very fanservicy film, full of reverences, callbacks and little cameos. It is an amazing film even without them, full of amazing action scenes, great character moments and mind-blowing special effects. But it truly shines as an ending. If you've seen all the previous films. If you've grown to love these characters. If you've invested yourself in this universe. Then it becomes something life-defining. It becomes a cornerstone. A feature of culture. Something that will be talked about for generations.A very good film on its own. A great movie. But when you take into account the enormity of the MCU, it becomes something unlike anything else. I wonder if I will ever see a movie like this one in my lifetime. I hope so, but it is not a given. And that fact alone, that uniqueness, that scope, pays for all the praise imaginable.Thank you, Marvel. Here's to another decade of adventure.",positive
"Watched Endgame twice in its two days of release in India. It's an epic and emotional movie showing everything for its perfect conclusion of 11 years. Beyond expectations, this movie will amaze you in every moment. Can't say too much because as a fan, everyone has a lot to say. Love to be a Marvel fan.",positive
"(Flash Review)Obviously picking up where Infinity War left off, this was the epic conclusion. I won't spoil the plot but this was epic and mammoth in duration, scale and amount of superheroes. The Avengers are trying to find Thanos to kill him after wiping half the population from existence but will they be able to find a way to undo all the evil he has done? Will anyone actual perish during this mission? So pretty much every superhero makes an appearance, some just for mere seconds and some just get one shot to showcase their specially so the bulk are barely utilized. I felt that could have been better orchestrated and showing more of the big battle that was staged. The superheroes that carry the movie get the most action and drama. The drama was so intense for some heroes that people were openly weeping in the audience as well as cheering. This was an entertaining movie. I liked Infinity War more because I felt the core plan to undo Thanos's evil was a bit ho-hum. Thor was HILARIOUS and did his best 'The Dude' impression.",positive
"I was so hyped for this movieIt was gonna be the best avengers movie EVER they said
Best thing in the movie happend when the movie was almost done
Avengers and friends fighting thanos army
Scarlet witch fight vs thanos thats how a female hero should be
Have the guts to fight someone strongerBut only thing i hated it lack of hawkeye doing whats hes good at : being a badass with his bow or even with a sword
Would rather have seen less captain america or iron man for more hawkeyeMovie wasnt that great it got overhyped
stil giving it a 7 even thought i expected more",positive
Epic .still can't believe what happened. It was a great battle.in the end my eyes was filled with tears.,positive
"The movie starts out slow but once it picks the pace up it doesn't stop. The final battle was amazing and is easily one of the greatest battles seen in cinema history. The things I didn't like was that at times it was clear that their were too many characters to appropriately showcase each of them and that the conclusion arcs for cap, iron man, and Thor was unsatisfying to say the least. Cap selfishly decides to stay in the past to be with Peggy. But he doesn't do anything to prevent tony's parents from being killed or Bucky from being tortured. He just sits there waiting for them to find him in the future when he's old. It was completely out of character. Tony's death was illogical and unnecessary. Tony deserved the happy ending since he had finally found a true home with pepper and his daughter. And finally the Russo brothers just botched Thor's arc completely. His whole story was about taking responsibility and leading his people, but he just decides to say idgaf and leave to fly around with the Guardians.",positive
"Where was The Living Tribunal? What A Disaster Movie.Endgame is the highest grossing film ever worldwide and the 5th highest worldwide when adjusted for inflation. But it was complete Garbage. It is not part of the 23 MOVIES anymore.After a year of waiting since that Epic Piece that was Infinity War, this is the Endgame that Dr. Strange was on about? What A Disaster, It was a complete shambles. They had perfect vision when they made Infinity War but it is like they lost the Power when making this silly borefest.Problems with this movie:° Where was The Living Tribunal? The Being was ment to Bring the Characters Back and Judge Thanos. Not this Time Travel Garbage.° What happened to Captain Marvel? A whole origin movie for her, for the build up to this and that's what they produce? Is this a Joke?° How can you destroy the Infinity Stones when each of them contain an Element of Existence itself?° How Can You Put the Soul Stone back?° How can Gamora come back from the dead but Black Widow Can't?° Why is Hulk a Big Joke? Isn't he the Strongest?° This Thanos doesn't know any of the people he is fighting.° The Time Travel fix everything nonsense, do they not get it? It is just too easy and boring.° The movie is way too long and boring.° Thor was a complete Joke° No Epic Battle between Hulk and Thanos that EVERYONE was waiting for.° No Proper battle between Captain Marvel and Thanos that was built up to happen.° The Final battle was LacklustreThe Highlights were:° Great Quotes from Thanos° Captains America vs Thanos was Great° The 'I Am Inevitable' Snap from Thanos was Really GreatThis Movie was terrible, what the hell were they thinking?The Endgame should have started out by Thanos Seeking to Make another Infinity Gauntlet for the purpose of defence, then using the Reality and Time Stones to recover his army. Begin Fortifying his Defenses on a different Planet with his army defending him and getting ready for the Avengers final assault on him now that they have recruited Captain Marvel.The Living Tribunal Should of Judged Thanos and Brought the Characters back in this Movie.OH Boy, they blew it. What a missed Opportunity. 😒",negative
"After watching Infinity War, I could not wait for this one. But as the time passed, I felt that End Game would not surpass Infinity War's awesomeness. But now that I have watched it, my advice to everyone is keep your expectations as high as possible, and still it would surpass all your expectations. It truly justifies all the 22 movies and please watch them all before watching this one. Stay away from spoilers. You will laugh and definitely cry multiple times.",positive
"This is a movie that I saw in theaters and I was blown away for a movie based off comic books. I was excited when I saw Avengers: Infinity War and wanted to see where they would go to end this. I've now given it a second viewing thanks to my wife, Jaime, who got us the Internet Movie Database Top 100 movies poster and this was on it.What I credit this movie, as well as Infinity War, is to assemble a cast like this. We are picking up the events where the last movie left off, but we are five years in the future. The world is trying to heal, but it is a struggle. The remaining Avengers are trying to find Thanos (Josh Brolin) and get the infinity stones back to undo what he did. This movie is strategic in hiding Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) in the quantum realm. He comes back with a plan to fix everything and defeat this powerful villain.As I've already said, the cast is great. They brought back pretty much everyone. It is fun to see people that don't normally interact doing so. This movie deals with time travel, where I think it gets a bit problematic, but I can overlook it. It is also a CGI-fest. I can't fault it though as it looks good. I'll even be honest; I've teared up both times after watching this movie as it does get a bit emotional. This movie lived up to the hype and I think that it held up for a second viewing. I've cooled a bit with my tastes changing, but this is a great movie regardless.My Rating: 9 out of 10.",positive
"I have absolutely no words for how good it was. I 10/10 recommend it, it's happy, sad, but satisfying.",positive
"The Russo brother did it! They gave a majestic conclusion to a tuli marvelous saga. I have never cried so many times in a movie and my body gave me a new ""feeling"": at one very cool moment of the movie my body just... shook.
I was amazed of how much they could cover in ""just"" 3 hours and it surely didn't feel that long. Things I wanted to happen, happened better I hoped.
I am just very happy for this movie, it is now my favorite movie of all time and I can't wait to see it again!",positive
"This movie coud be shorter on some parts at a begining and give us more of these awsome fight scenes.
At first i was woried that it could be boring, but after some time to me it was realy great!!
And ended so much beter than i expected!!
I loved it :)",positive
This a generational wonder and kids will never understand in coming years how much this meant.,positive
"This was a cool and fun film... but it did not meet expectations being that this was the grand finale we've all been waiting for... it had its epic moments and I laughed.. a lot.. but I just expected more.. especially after being blown away by Infinity War... this film was kinda a let down for me.. like most reviews already stated... they went a little to far with the humor. Some of the characters were just not the hero's we know and love... after all this waiting around for the biggest battle in MCU history.. it was short and not that exciting... I'm a huge Marvel fan... and as a fan.. for me at least... Marvels big finale was disappointing.... but, I gave it a 7 being that it was fun, seeing all the hero's on the big screen like that was great and it had its moments... but still a let down.. Thanks for reading.",positive
"Overall, I think it's not as good as Infinity War. Pretty disappointed with what they did with Thor and the Hulk. Pretty average movie, and much as I hate to say.",positive

"It seems like there's always a big Movie Event nowadays, like the last Lord of the Rings movie, the last Harry Potter, or the first Stars Wars movie in forever. Each of these movies packs a huge emotional wallop as we see the culmination of story arcs we've been following for several years. With the Avengers, we've been following these arcs for ten years (and now 22 films), and Endgame had the unenviable task of following the cliffhanger of its immediate predecessor. How will the Avengers reverse the Decimation? Well, for starters they'll do so in a three-hour-plus movie - and they'll need every minute, too. But the road to redemption is not a straight one at all, and if you thought that the final scenes in other franchises were powerful...well, in Endgame they happen very frequently. How emotional is this movie? Bearing in mind that it's a comic book movie, not a Hallmark movie, one wouldn't expect only the broadest of 'heavy' scenes, and yet in Endgame these scenes seem to occur every few minutes. How emotional? It used to be that people would rate melodramas based on the number of handkerchiefs they needed to wipe their tears or blow their noses. For Endgame, I'd say it's a five hankie movie, but only if one reuses one's hankie a lot. I counted twelve tear-inducing scenes. 12! But the franchise has always depended, to some degree, on surprises, and luckily for me nothing was spoiled beforehand. In Endgame, we see many, many character arcs completed one way or another. The movie is exceedingly satisfying and emotional draining. It is far and away the finest comic book movie I've ever seen, and I hope it joins Black Panther in garnering itself an Oscar nomination or two next year. There isn't a single moment in this movie that misses a step, no single overwrought or drawn-out scene. There is just moment after moment of awesomeness. Even if you have just a vague idea of what the plot is or who the Avengers are, you probably won't watch this movie without feeling something magical. The characters are well written and exceptionally well played. The action is exhilarating. The ending is cathartic. It's very worthwhile to see this in a theater, too.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is an incredibly epic conclusion to the infinity saga that skillfully ends this era of the MCU whilst also setting up the next. The direction by Joe and Anthony Russo is amazing once again. All the performances are great and Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans are all incredible. The visual effects are incredible. It's surprisingly funny, emotional and extremely well paced with incredible action sequences. Also the third act is truly incredible and the score by Alan Silvestri is easily his best Avengers score.",positive
A true film geared towards fans made by fans this movie is good conclusion to many childhoods and a very amazing conclusion for 11 years of marvel truly spectacular.,positive
Watching this movie gave me tears of joy and sadness. This is the best Marvel movie ever made,positive
Move was good but not great. Lots of plot holes and movie felt way too dragged out. No real surprises since you saw everything coming. My son and I would rate this as the 3rd best Avengers movie. Infinity war being better and the original.,positive
"I enjoyed this movie as it brought.closure to the previous movie and the series. I enjoyed the time travel hunt for the ""pebbles"" that will restore order to the universe and the chemistry with the cast and the movie altogether, especially the climactic battle scenes. If you are a Marvel Comics movie fan, this will satisfy you l** 1/2 out of ****",positive
"Enjoyed the movie, I am a huge fan of the MCU, and have been since day 1. But this movie was ruined by Thor being fat and so stupid. There was no need for the mcu to make him like that. He's been getting stronger and stronger in every movie, but this one completely ruins him and everything that he is about. If they were going to make Thor that way, they should have just killed him off when Loki and heimdall were killed. And then cap picks up Mjolnir, Yes he is worthy but it's just just not right.. ( maybe I feel like this because I am a massive fan of Thor ).",positive
"After 21 other pretty great and fun movies, these last two Avengers movies are such a let down . After Infinity I did guest that time travel would be introduced, which is so lame and irritating. Very disappointing!",negative
"Plot; The remaining Avengers attempt to reverse the result of Thanos' victory and restore the universe to its previous state.If building to the crescendo is tough, satisfyingly hitting that final note is, well, really tough. Thankfully the masterminds and powers that be in the MCU are up to the task. There have been bumps along the way leading to this point. Not every film in the MCU has been a classic, or frankly even good (Thor 2, Iron Man 3). But when it counts, Marvel delivers, and here it delivers in spades.Clocking in a shade under 3 hrs., Endgame never the less breezes by despite having significantly less action than any previous Avengers movie (@ least in ratio to its runtime). That's because by this point we're invested in story and character and the focus here is wisely there. Oh believe me there's action, but it's all the more satisfying because of the carefully crafted stakes. By this point the trick isn't finding emotional purchase. We come into the theater w/that already. The real trick is earning it, and Endgame does just that. Well done, everyone.",positive
"I laughed, I cried, I cheered and I said goodbye. An excellent ending to the best universe ever created!",positive
"My biggest problem with this movie is that it focuses so much on Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America. I liked the way Infinity War juggled so many characters, giving them all great moments. The final battle is great, though.",positive
Alright. It was sort of like Avengers 3 meets Back to the Future. Good action and a nice little conclusion to phase 3 or 4 of the Marvel universe.,positive
"Things you never expected take place in the movie, it takes us through a journey of all the characters. There is no such emotion which the movie lacks, right from humour,joy to grief. I'll definitely watch it over and over again. And last but not the least, thank you Avengers.",positive
"This film had everything! Action, comedy, stake, emotion, surprises and fan service.The film didn't feel like 3 hours eitherHard to write much for this without giving anything away!Fully worth a watch! For more impact, watch the others before hand or else you will be confused and there will be bits that won't land or will go over your head",positive
"This avengers finale had all the usual ingredients of humour, action, drama and brilliant cinematography but it did not of them memorably. One of the reasons Infinity War was so great was experience left from main characters dying. So when the main plot premise of ""let's turn back time and win this time"" I was not only truly disappointed but instantly disinterested of what the movie might become. In the end the second half was a little better with some short snippets of good action but left me wondering what more this could have been.",positive
The only complaint about Avengers: Endgame is that it raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it.,positive
"There are storylines which must be answered, but as a whole I felt the movie felt forced. Forced to answer every question, forced to have to include certain charcters. There are excellent parts of the movie (Tony Starks Storyline) how Ant-man is used and how Hulk is used. But the movie feels disjointed and I don't care how Thor is used and I also feel that this movie has to much rehashing versus uniqueness that storylines and concepts that made Infinity War so much better.",positive
"Cheesy humor, extremely overrated,
And not enough Thanos ;)Way to many jokes destroying tension and suspense...First hour and a half should have lasted 40 minutes.Thanos is by far the best character in the movie, who barely got any screen time. Why not give the ""villain"" some actual screen time?Thanos isn't even a bad guy. He wanted to make the universe better.... even if he never had the right plan.Also, When Thanos snapped, half the universe died painlessly. No suffering.Fat jokes about Thor.... that Got VERY old very quickly.Captain Marvel should have been killed by thanos. That would have been amazing!!!Thanos throwing Captain Marvel was by far the greatest moment of the movie.Falling back on Time travel is a pathetic way to get the attention of an audience and to save the universe. We've just seen this 1000 times.It was just Painfully overrated.Should have been a 2 hour 15 minute movie overall.Thanos was really the only good character.... because he didn't try to make awkward and cheesy jokes every 10 seconds like every other Avenger lunatic.Iron man snapped thanos out of existence..... That means he's not much nicer than Thanos is.Not the worst movie, just incredibly overrated. It was average, and I'm just being realistic.And about an hour to long.",negative
What is wrong with people.they are rating 1 or 2. I mean this is the greatest movie of marvel. Those who are rating 1 on this movie are probably hater or they don't have better taste on movies.,positive
"Everything you could want in a sci-fi epic. The action is perfect. The story is perfect by somehow juggling so many character arcs yet giving each and every one of them an emotional punch. The thrils send chills down your spine by culminating every movie in the MCU we all love together in a special kind of epic one can only dream of. The jokes are hilarious; they ring true to the MCU style without taking away from the dark themes on grief and moving on from loss. And the emotional beats are more than just tear jerking, they are sob jerking! Perfectly concludes the story arc of so many characters and the MCU itself by focusing on the characters and the drama of themes such as sacrifice and loss. Not to mention one of the most emotionally filled endings I have ever seen! EPIC!! The movie accomplishes all this by staying very character focused, while not falling into the MCU trap of being too formulaic or not having consequences. OH MAN does this movie take risks and while not all the decisions will work for everybody, they alllll clicked for me resulting in the best movie watching experience I have ever (and likely will ever) had.",positive

"EndgameThis is most definitely one for the fans, quite impossible to understand the main plot or the nuanced references unless you had watched the previous 22 movies.Well I have and I thought overall it was brilliant, I watched it in the 3D 4 DX version and though the rain and lightening good fun was had by all. The three hours flew by to the redemptive conclusion.I will list the really good aspects and the not so good1, we had lots of humour, well placed and well timed it was genuinely funny.2, the action sequences were great and were not overly long, just about right I would say.3, the plot, whilst fantastical, held together, great!4, Captain Marvel was not invincible, and looked more like the superhero she is, so this worked.5, fine bromance elements.6, Hulk's transformation was a master-strokeNow the not so good1, the beginning had slow dialogue that just was not meaningful, baggy is the word!2, why they felt the need to have absolutely every Marvel character including the minors turned into an obsession, this proved to be overwhelmingly.3, the music was unmemorable, pity!4, we needed Thor restored earlier as an Apollonian god.5, the sexy element of Marvel superheroes was dumbed out, there was no one to dream about.I loved this movie and for Marvel fans this delivers the goods and they will find no fault.",positive
"Didn't meet expectations which were pretty high to begin with after infinity war. As others have mentioned, too many plot holes, too many characters, just did not work for me. Captain Marvel was made to look uninspiring, and was grossly under utilized.the Abengers franchise lost it's charm.",positive
"Deus ex machina? No Deus ex capt. Marvela!
I audibly groaned at the A-Force shot because it made no sense in the context of the film, and it's pandering to a tiny minority of the community that mocks these types of movies anyway.
It's not just male characters that were trivialized by Miss Marvel. All the organic female heroines were also pacified by Captain Marvel, most of all, Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch. Brie Larson is the toxic element that has contaminated the MCU. She literally ruined exery scene she was in. She is a repulsive human and a horrible ACTRESS! Remove her and get #IdentityPolitics out of the MCU!",positive
"In the movie ""Avenger Endgame"" they have a scene when hulk snaps his fingers and still survives the radiation. however, they could of used hulk again at the end instead of iron man, because Iron man already knew it would kill him, so I feel like they could of fixed a lot of that.",positive
"Another generic Marvel film. Forced jokes. Lots of CGI. The Hulk is a complete joke in this movie (So is Thor), waste of a good actor and character. It's the ultimate Marvel movie, and we don't get to see Hulk go berserk? Totally lame. There was a lot of wasted opportunity in this film, it isn't by any means a great movie. Russo brothers are lame. This movie was so anticlimactic, Marvel tried so hard to give their characters heart and soul as they wrapped up the franchise. If you've seen this movie once there's no need to watch it again.",negative
"22 years with overs 11 movies and one epic ending,the MCU Deserves it all",positive
For me Endgame was emotional saga and the journey of our generation came to and end and yes it was not action packed as Infinity War but I feel every violence comes to and end with piece and the ENDGAME could not have better journey then to have established the storyline the way they did.,positive
"Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame (2019) is the best finale to the Infinity Saga that has been built up through 3 phases of the MCU. I will not spoil anything.The whole superhero cast is great like Robert Downy Jr. And Chris Evan as Iron Man/Tony Stark and Captain America/Steve Rogers. The action scenes are awesome, and the heroes are great during them.The main plot will be a surprise to Marvel fans, especially when the whole movie gives Marvel fans what they want from beginning to end.The 3rd act ultimate battle is amazing and Marvel fans will love it when they see it. I suggest watching the earlier MCU films that connect to this just in case you have trouble figuring out what is happening during the movie.Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) are part 1 and part 2 of the finale. Both movies are great and are worth watching back-to-back to give a satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga.",positive
"Extremely well done. I haven't watched all the others leading up to this one, but seeing Endgame makes me want to in order to appreciate it all the more. As I was watching, I couldn't stop thinking about how massive the budget for this film must have been, and when I looked it up, I was both surprised and unsurprised simultaneously; the investment really shows. Let's hope they'll spend a good chunk of the revenue on raises for their employees now that the film is such a success, but we all know the real odds of that happening.",positive

"I had high expectations. Infinity War was great in comparison to this one. Sadly, Endgame feels like less.",positive
"Overview: Avengers: Endgame is a messy but an impact-full end to the many marvel movies that came before it. It manages to pay homage to the past whilst showing the possibilities of the future.Pros: All of the main Avengers have their moments to shine and shine they do. Arcs for Captain America and Iron Man feel thoroughly earned. There are a lot of surprises in the movie and most feel earned and well-developed. Considering how many characters there are in the movie, it is an achievement that it feels natural and not shoehorned. Parts of the movie are much darker than I thought however, the tone remains consistent throughout.Cons: They do something with Thanos towards the end that erases what happens in Infinity War which undercuts the ""win"" against him in the movie.
Most of the messy stuff comes into play with Thor and a spoiler ""thing"" which I will not discuss.
The scenes with Thor were supposed to be funny, you know like marvel movies funny, BUT I was not laughing at all. It felt so completely out of place and out of character. It is a horrible direction that the directors decided to take this character, who absolutely shined in Infinity War.
Talking of weird directions, a character in Endgame makes a huge decision off-screen that should have been shown on-screen. This didn't feel earned but rushed for the sake of the movie which is 3 hours long.
The run-time is mostly justified but there are several and I mean several scenes that can be completely cut of and it would have ZERO effect in the story.Summary: All-in-all, Endgame achieves its goal of giving a fitting end to the marvel movies and hinting at possible future directions, however, it does so with noticeable faults. Go in with an open-mind and you'll certainly enjoy it a lot.Rating: 8.5/10",positive
"Yes, nostalgia is great and all, but in this situation, it just doesn't cut it. Time travel is a cheap way of story telling, and it makes Thanos' success in Infinity War feel pointless. All the different timelines makes things super confusing and controversial. I wanted to see new things in the Marvel universe, not the past. When we do get to the final fight scene, it's fantastic. The three fighting against Thanos is intense and epic (wish we got more screen time of that).",positive
"I give this movie 1 because of course lower this rating and should lower and be under infinity war.
The end is good but the kill of thanos in the beginning is so bad and get another thanos form another time line i think the main villan is just replace to another and many thing like black widow can't back because it in another time line but we see this green female back??
And when they back in time the director don't give as a master peace if they ask Christopher to help them they film will be like a bomb",negative

"There have been few movie events as big as the 22nd instalment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As the title suggests, this three-hour epic is the culmination of a 12-year series that has become the benchmark for blockbuster movie-making. Since Iron Man screened in 2008 I've been there every step of the way, which makes it virtually impossible to view, or review, Endgame with any sort of objectivity. Staying spoiler-free means there's little I can talk about in the way of plot specifics, although suffice to say there are twists and turns all the way throughout this sweeping finale as it strives to deliver satisfying conclusions and/or defining moments for the vast array of beloved characters. Justifiably, there's no attempt here to bring in new fans or to create a film that can stand on its own; it's a cathartic, somewhat nostalgic experience that relies on the emotional investment built up over 21 movies. This franchise has arguably become a tad unwieldly, with the team-up adventures in particular having to squeeze in an increasing amount of heroes; however, Endgame whittles it mostly back to the original Avenger crew, which is both wise and fitting. It's glorious to watch Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk and Hawkeye teaming up for their biggest battle yet, with the MCU's big bad Thanos just a click away from causing Earth even more grief than before. Despite the end-of-world stakes the humour is amped up to surprisingly high levels, the quips and one-avengers endliners coming thick and fast in amongst ambitious long-form gags that reference previous entries whilst also subverting convention and audience expectation. The quantity of action sequences is relatively low with a distinct lack of memorable set pieces to inspire awe, but the climactic showdown is a fist-pumping crowd pleaser that throws everything except the kitchen sink at the screen. The finale also boasts one of the MCU's greatest moments, a simple but hugely effective surprise that sends shivers down the spine. It's by no means a perfect film - even the lightest of retrospective discussion unearths the abundance of plot holes - and it'll likely diminish in favour once far enough removed from the current zeitgeist surrounding it. But it doesn't matter. This is a cinematic experience for the now. It's meant to be consumed with the hype still swirling around it. The numerous flaws may be ripe for criticising down the track, at present they're merely blips in a gratifying conclusion of the 22-film 'Infinity Saga'. The MCU isn't finished, not by a long shot, and I can't wait to see where the next 22 MCU outings take us, but Avengers: Endgame is the end of an era, and boy has it been one hell of a fun ride!",positive
"The story line was mostly boring, the characters (banner and Thor) were embarrassing and I missed the funny dialogues.",positive
"First of all, the bad reviews must come from big Avatar fans (which btw is amazing too). Even if you are not a comic fan at all it can't be rated as 1...
This Movie is in every single point just awesome. The story and the road from the first iron man movie till endgame is perfection.
It is more serious than infinity war and more dramatic. And the final battle is just epic and tops even Lord of the Ring Battles.
A must see! the most successful movie in history speaks for itself.",positive

"I honestly don't understand what people liked in this movie. There was too much inspiration from a third class chick flick, with completely useless emotional scenes from super heros who don't really inspire any emotions. Acting and dialogs were also terribly executed. The movie could have easily be completed in half an hour without losing any content.",negative
"Wraps up about 10 years of movies spectacularly. Great character development, humor, and just enough fan service. People will say the first 2 hrs were slow, but I had no issues with it.

"Following the aftermath depicted in last year's ""Avengers: Infinity War"", the gang of superheroes devise a plan to undo the great harm caused by the evil Thanos.This film is the forth in the series that originated in 2012. It also happens to be the best. There are signs this could be the last in the series; thus there are emotional moments resulting from some shocking surprises that make us realize that we always felt something for the characters beyond their superhero abilities. More feelings are raised to the surface in time travel sequences when characters are in touch with those they lost a long time ago.Another reason this movie stands out in its genre is that it is actually comprehensible throughout. The flaw of convoluted, busy plots have dragged down many in this genre (including prequels to this one) but ""Avengers: Endgame"" stands out for being accessible to those of us who spend only a bit of time in the Marvel Universe.In playing with the device of time travel, the story mostly wins except for an inconsistency with the character Nebula near the film's end. This is unfortunate as, up to that point, the Nebula story was one of the most fascinating. This is thankfully a small flaw compared to the film's many pluses.I had the good fortune to see this great film in IMAX 3-D. Perhaps, it is for this reason that the production values (editing, cinematography, CGI, set design costumes) stand out greatly.Magnificent entertainment.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame defies 11 years of mounting hype and expectations to deliver a rousing, crowd-pleasing, and appropriately emotional endcap to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's ""Infinity Saga"". From its now-humble beginnings in 2008, the MCU has evolved from mainly character-driven origin stories, to world-decimating adventures that span multiple universes. At times, this evolution has correlated to a loss in grounded emotion, but Avengers: Endgame wisely returns to the MCU's earlier method of storytelling by shifting its focus back to its core heroes and their story arcs. Avengers: Endgame fittingly ties together ALL 21 previous MCU films in a way that not only honors but elevates those previous movies - it truly feels as if every journey, grand (The Avengers) or small (Ant-Man & The Wasp), has been equally instrumental in building to this climax. The fact that Avengers: Endgame pulls off this tremendous feat, while also managing a few surprises along the way, is nothing short of a remarkable cinematic achievement. Now can critics argue that the film has its fair share of plot holes and relies too heavily on fan service at times - sure. Are the MCU's notorious tonal shifts still present and still jarring - of course. But is it likely we'll ever experience a superhero film saga this epic in scope with a pay-off this exceptional and well-earned again - no. 'Nuff said.",positive
"Endgame - it is here. And it is bigger, stronger and more exciting then ever.Prepare to get your mind blown and hold on to your seats. This movie is a wild one as you probably expect. You will get a few decent laughs. A dozen of epic sequences and big reveals. That will even shatter the long debates between hardcore what could happen or who can do what.Some characters will change in unexpected ways and will make you laugh more than you will probably expect.It will go for three hours and you will not want it to stop.",positive
The end that a saga of this magnitude needes! Very nice plot that doesn't let you get bored.,positive
Nothing spectacular and very messy. Not as entertaining as the previous one. To be honest they are way too many characters to fit in a story. I was also expecting abit more presence from Captain Marvel. I found the ending abit similar to Batman Vs Superman...7.8 my score,positive
"... so don't.It's a time travel jumble that never settles into a solid theory of time, predestination, or the multiverse theory. Or more speficially, it tells you its theory and then spends the next couple of hours breaking it over and over.
If you try to work it out, side effects may include headache, nosebleed, and a desire to have a bit of a lie down.
That said, it's emotionally perfect as the ending of the whole series thus far. The 22 film + shorts + tv-shows-if-you-like-that-kind-of-thing has a definitive end as well as the promise of a new day just ahead.
In the shared-universe age of films, this is the first time I've felt like I was seeing a ""series finale"" the way one would with a long-running TV series.
Now to hope that what lies ahead isn't a bunch of films that feel like ""After MASH"", trying to keep the IP alive when all of the interesting characters/actors have shuffled off down the road.",positive
"Yeah, I get it, it's an Avengers movie, so audience it not entitled to a decent story, but guys ... Come on!
I found the 50% of living beings die-conclusion of Infinity War refreshing and brave. Rowing back now with some random time machine explanation really sucks. Nothing matters any more at all. Not to speak of the countless plot holes. It reminded me of a presidential speech: I didn't say that and if I did, I didn't mean it, and if I did I can reverse it.Once Thanos is dead for good (I hope), the movie stretches another 30 mins or so without much happening and I was hoping for some more action, but the movie lets you down here too. The action in general is neither surprising nor good. It's good enough you don't give the movie a rating under 5, but there is nothing new to see here either. There are no remarkable or memorable action scenes really.I could feel the producers wanted to make a good and somewhat complex story (3 teams in 3 different time periods) but in the end it's utterly stupid. Why would they use the time machine to bring all five Infinity Stones together in a time period and place where Thanos is? What could possibly go wrong? The Avengers might have super powers, but they are not the brightest it seems.The change in some characters (Thor becomes The Dude, Hulk becomes the village idiot) was somewhat refreshing, but watching the former Hulk smash everything to bits in a very short segment in the beginning was what I was actually had wished for to see. The new Hulk does nothing except for being green. Thor at least finds somewhat back to his former self but yeah, they all disappoint the audience in one way or the other.
None of the main characters sparks joy with me, except for Rocket and Nebula maybe, but the rest is just lame and sometimes really boring to watch. Thor joining the Guardians in the end might be a fitting match, but on my way home from the movies I was thinking, that the GOTG party is already large enough. Another fighter in the party? Hm... I don't know, but we'll see.",positive
"It's hard to believe that this is the highest grossing movie of all time. It's not even that good of a Marvel movie.I understand that this is based on a comic book characters but damn! The fact that this movie is so successful is pretty much the reason why Hollywood thinks they can get away making movies that aren't all that well thought out but look cool. The first hour was downright painful to get through and if they had taken out a lot of the unnecessary crap, this movie easily could have been 2 hours long.",negative
"Movie night with Iris.The Avengers franchise comes to both a rich and mostly satisfying conclusion. This is complex and emotional stuff, but doesn't take itself too seriously.Despite the running time the action felt paired back, and the intimate scenes given equal billing.The basic plot is pretty clunky, but the Back to the Future gags acknowledge that. The feminist apologies even clunkier, and too late. However the film delivers spectacle, gags and an intelligent, emotional kick.",positive
"If you haven't seen this movie in the theatres, then I am sorry to say that you have missed an experience which is beyond anything anyone can say. The movie provides an ultimate payoff to your hard-work in watching the previous 21 movies. The callbacks and references to the previous movies is just phenomenal, and the emotional quotient of the movie is higher than expected, but it is perfect. A must watch...🙌🏻",positive
"A lot of things from comics I thought impossible to see in the big screen, at least in this iteration of these characters came so unexpectedly that anything I want to say about the film can become a spoiler. What can be said is that they took time to set up the emotional core of the film even though story wise it was going all over the place. But everything pays off with the visual spectacle that gives the highest level of fan service. The epic showdown in the last hour was making the crowd crazy in the theatre.",positive
"I just watched the movie for a second time around and I have to say it was even more emotional this time around. I read alot of reviews where it was said that infinity war was better. I agree that it was more faced paced and there was alot more action but this movie is the last of phase 3 excluding spider man : far from home. This movie was meant to show the loss and toll that Thanos' snap had on everyone who survived. It showed the ones who were lost and the road to getting everyone back. The movie also came full circle - it took us back to the first avengers movie, the chance for Tony to meet his father one last time and the loss to acquire the stones. The action at the end was the best among all the marvel movies. I did love the fight scene in infinity war but this was just spectacular. I cannot imagine how the marvel cinematic universe will be after this. It was the best in cinematic history - it was funny and emotional and it will never be the same again. As I said ""ITS THE END OF AN ERA"".",positive
Makes me cry everytime i see it. Loved every second. I don't understand these other reviews saying they are dissapointed. To me it was perfect,positive
"(Spoiler Free)
This movie was absolutely amazing! A great culmination of the last 11 years of the MCU. See it in IMAX if you can.",positive
"I am going to be very unpopular her, and seem to be in the minority but this is barely an okay action film.The advertising stated Dr Strange has seen endgame 14 million time.... believe me once is enough.I loved infinity war, and it is by far the best MCU film. This is just a means to bring back characters. Yes it ends the saga but is lacking.The humour is clumsy and although a few laugh out loud moments, overall these seemed forced.It had so much potential and although filmed simultaneously with infinity war, feels like a totally separate film. It's akin to one person writing one and then someone else picking up the second, disagreeing with that story line and just making there own version by undermining what the first and the other 21 movies had achieved.",positive
An amazing movie. I couldn't imagine how hard it is to live up to and end a franchise like this. They managed to make an amazing movie. Coming from a comic book lover. I don't think anyone could have done it better.,positive
"Obviously anyone who has spend years watching MCU movies would go to watch Endgame with high hopes. I went with a hope to have a logical but entertaining end to the saga. I was disappointed. These are my impressions:
Movie is 3 hour long but 50% of time is wasted on whining actors who have all but given up after their losses (during the previous movie!) Guys, we already know what happened there, now move on. Film makes these heroes pitiful, sad and tired looking humans- Thor is epitome of what I mean. Well, we have enough of those in real lives and we don't show up at 11 pm to watch that!
Storyline was silly and predictable. I wanted to see the re-match between Avengers and Thanos but that was poorly done and I don't even understand how it abruptly ended!Positives were some funny moments.",positive
"So can this be the Thor 'nightmare' sequence?
And what did Thanos have against garbage collectors that apparently they were all disappeared?
And 5 years later... try 10 on Scott's daughter.
And don't get me started on the timeline discrepancies...
And the first 30 minutes could have been done by the original trailer...
Tony out in space...lamentation of those lost...and Scott at the door. BAM! There.
Now get moving.
Didn't even mind the prolonged flashbacks to get the stones.
But what they did to Thor was a crime.
And cgi banner/hulk...not brilliant/not hulky.
And didn't address that 'floaty scary' figure looked an awful lot like red skull... The throw in a dash of SJW-which when Stan was alive wasn't even a factor... But fantastic acting by most everyone, especially rdj...
Waited the whole movie to see Tony reunited with Peter...
Glad hardly any marvel...
And how can Nebula's earlier timeline self be killed...but later timeline still live? Would have enjoyed it more with about 30 minutes left on the cutting room floor. Needed tightening up badly.
Sigh.
Captain America: Winter Soldier still my favorite...
but Russo bros needed someone strong to tell them 'no' ...
or needed to tell the writers markus and mcfeely no...
or hired a different editor...
imo.
Which is all this is.
Cue the wavy lines dream sequence graphics in 3, 2, 1....
Summary: Ok now take the infinity stones and do a 'do over'...",negative
"This movie is almost great all around, with a great story and an ending to some characters that were just perfect. This movie definitely doesn't leave out any loose ends, but it does have a problem. The movie completely destroys the character development of some of its beloved characters i.e.Thor. They completely took away everything people liked about Thor, and made him look less like a god, and more... pathetic to say the least.",positive
"Everyone must watch
It is one of the best movie of this decade
Vfx is ultimate",positive
"Has the Marvel Cinematic Universe surpassed Star Wars when it comes to cultural icons? I would make the argument. I see more people wearing shirts of the Marvel heroes, kids are playing with the toys, adults still read the comics, and have several theme park attractions (at both Disney and Universal!). Even when it comes to content, Marvel has made more movies then Star Wars (compare Star Wars to its nine and the MCU's 23). The other piece of magic it has that no money could ever buy is its staying power. A lot like how Star Wars will continue to be introduced to new generations, the same will go for the MCU.Marvel also gave us one of the most talked about movies of last year, Avengers: Endgame. Most people I know, even my parents who don't watch superhero movies, were blown away with how much was thrown at them with action humor, and a shockingly bleak ending with half of life being erased and the villain winning. So how was Disney going to top it off in the next part? It's safe the say the Russo brothers did a phenomenal job showing where to go next in Avengers: Endgame. Is it perfect? For the most part.After Iron Man and Nebula are brought back to Earth by Captain Marvel, the surviving Avengers manage to track Thanos to try and undo the snap. Though they kill him, they also see that the stones were destroyed with the snap, thus making the snap permanent. Five years passes as the Earth and the rest of the universe cope with half of life gone. Some have moved on while others haven't. Iron Man has settled down with a family, Wakanda is without a king, many of the cosmic characters like Rocket Raccoon and Captain Marvel are dealing with the problems of space, Thor has become a fat drunk, Bruce Banner and Hulk have merged, and Captain America continues to cope with the fact he's more alone then ever.An new way to fix things comes in the answer of Scott Lang/Ant-Man who reveals that even though he was stuck in the quantum realm for five years, it only felt like five minutes to him. Seeing that time works and manipulates different at that level, the avengers convince Stark to help build a machine to shrink everyone. The goal is to split into teams and get the stones before Thanos does. It's a time heist to restore life and maybe get a second shot at defeating Thanos.Without revealing too much, Avengers: Endgame delivered more then I anticipated. This brings the infinity saga to a proper close that was started in Iron Man. Is it flawless? I wouldn't say that. But let's get to the good stuff first.The story and tone of the movie is great. This is a true epic that despite running over three hours, it doesn't feel like it. They could have added another half hour, but I probably wouldn't notice. Yes, there are a lot of slow burn moments like when the characters go through their struggles of lost friends, time travel, and fights, but all of it feels earned. I give credit to the script for still having some of the best ""tongue-in-cheek"" jokes in the series, and putting them in the story that's the most dramatic and somber.Like in Infinity War, the action is phenomenal. In fact, I don't even want to give it away, but with how the final act is set, it is a moment of movie magic that'll be remembered as much as the Death Star run in Star Wars and the ring being destroyed in Lord of the Rings. Every hero gets their shot and each one feels epic.
If the movie is flawed, its with the pacing. I don't mind a time jump, but not everything feels like an impact as the movie thinks it does. For example, when we see the Hulk, even though the effect is funny, I would have liked to have seen how he got there. Same thing for Hawkeye, Iron Man, and the cosmic characters. This is an instance where an extended cut would be welcome. Things flows better once the time heist plot starts and keeps it for the majority of the movie.I'll give nine infinity gauntlet comics out of ten. This is the moment where the orchestra plays it's big number. This is level eight of the Super Mario Bros. This is an awesome finale to a story that I don't know how Marvel and Disney are going to top this...nor do I think they ever will. If you haven't seen Infinity War yet, be sure to do before watching this. Endgame serves as a nice bookend to the series and I think everyone will be happy with this.",positive

"Endgame should be revered purely based on the fact that the writers have managed to conclude virtually every storyline running in the Marvel universe. This was some feat, considering the vast numbers of important characters and the multiple timelines that needed closing. Further to this, none of the pivotal players were short changed in their conclusions, paying close attention to each one of the original Avengers cast.The film was also not saturated with fight scenes for its 3 hour run time, a real risk when producing superhero films - instead, character interactions were heavily utilised, employing slightly more pathos than Marvel films ordinarily use. Special mentions must go to Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who was uncharacteristically used almost exclusively as comedic relief - undoubtedly a risk, but one that succeeds thanks to Hemsworth's often-overlooked versatility as an actor. This was also Robert Downey Jr's best performance as Iron Man, with slightly fewer quips and more heartfelt emotion on display.Endgame is not, however, the perfect film: flaws are unavoidable in a universe as widely explored as this, and the major injustice seems to be the comparative screentimes and focus points on each character. The main culprit is Peppa Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), an entirely forgettable cast member from the Iron Man franchise, suddenly promoted to a semi-important role as one of the most powerful fighters...why? Why dilute the abilities of all of the other characters at your disposal and use Iron Man 2.0 (or 3.0 if you're also considering War Machine as an Iron Man copy) for the sake of it? Further to this, Captain Marvel once again disappoints. Her lack of meaningful involvement in the majority of the film makes the plot seem trivial and nonsensical, even more confusing when you consider the fact she was given an entire film only months before.On the reverse side of this, some important characters might as well not have even been looked at. The Guardians of the Galaxy (bar Rocket) were redundant in the film, strange considering the popularity of the spinoff franchise; furthermore, Nick Fury's borderline cameo appearance was a kick in the teeth for the longest tenured actor in the franchise.Whilst these criticisms are fairly harsh, this does not detract from the fact that Endgame is better than your average Marvel experience, and definitely does service to those fans who have stuck with the franchise for this long. Moreover, this film doesn't close the door to further films being made to continue the superhero trend. Unfortunately, as with most of these films/franchises, not enough is achieved to really propel this film into stardom - however, box office reports may yet prove me wrong.",positive
"Funny, emotional, surprising, and worth the wait. The 3 hours flew by, and i enjoyed every minute of it. More nostalgic than i was expecting, but great nonetheless.",positive
Worth watching but you won't be blown away. You're probably going to see it anyway but some characters don't get their deserved ending.,positive
"As others have said time travel is always a cop out, but there seem to be some major problems with it's use here, first is the fates of black widow and gamora, we are told (by the writer in the bluray commentary) that black widow can't be brought back because the fate of obtaining the soul stone can't be undone, yet gamora seems to have undone here fate from the same choice. The small point that if gamora never made the choice due to the time travel, then in fact none of the events in the previous could never have happened as Thanos would have been one stone short seems to be ignored.
Then you have Captain America's fate, he time travels back and lives out his days as agents Carters secret husband, cool. Unfortunately this then means that within the MCU universe He also has a reactionship with agent 13, technically his own great niece, whoops.",negative

"If you ever get the opportunity to watch ALL of the MCU movies back-to-back, in time-line order, please do so. The sweep, impact, and momentum from each movie carries over to the final climax of Infinity Wars & End Game. Wow! I just finished watching all 22 of the MCU movies in plot-line time order on Disney+ (over a week) and was fundamentally floored as to the depth and breadth of these movies and the linking story line(s). What MCU has done is paradigm shifting to the motion picture industry. For example, to think that a minor, seemingly throw-away plot point(s), in the first few movies could be later utilized as a significant plot vehicle in later movies is ingenious in its execution. The forethought and planning in the multiple plot arcs across multiples movies is groundbreaking. Certainly, never has this consistant and exceptional level of movie-making ever been done across so many movies of the same common plot: the acting, cinematography, VFX, sound, editing, etc, etc. I can think of no modern literary work that is as deep and intellectual as these movies...and all from a comic book(s)!",positive
"Had the advantage of having the Russo brothers, who made the Captain America films, the better of the Marvel series.Not really any standout performances. Josh Brolin's Thanos was effective. Downey has done Stark so many times it doesn't has the same charm it did. But that is expected.A catch-22 with having clarity in all the story lines, but felt I had to go along with the show vs. fully enjoying each character. Time constraints and just too many characters to fully feature all of them. More a giant jam session than picking out any special musicianship.Was barely with the time travel elements. Not that they were done bad but there was really nothing new with this 1000th instance a movie doing time travel.Fat Thor was fun but also awkward vs. the dark past elements that made him start drinking. The Hawkeye/Black Widow fight was good. The Gamora before and after was interesting. The new Hulk was fun. A few new angles on Nebula I enjoyed. Have not seen the Captain Marvel movie yet but now want to. Paul Rudd was Paul Rudd for awhile but was largely wasted. Everyone else was window dressing.Time travel? Meh. Felt kind of like an easy out. But not like there hasn't been a boatload of time travel movies.I was surprised that I was moved by the beginning of the last battle and everyone coming together. The detail was done pretty well.These giant movies get a lot of slurs and derision. I consider them more a circus than any dramatic and thespian attempt. It's fun to see the spectacle.",positive
You are putting yourself at a disadvantage if you never see this movie. The perfect ending to the perfect franchise.,positive
I love The Avengers movies for what they are. I read comics & in my teens i was hooked on Hulk (still my fav) but what they did to Hulk in these movies is a disgrace. When Scarlett Witch got in Hulks head & then Ragnarok happened I was very hopeful for World Breaker Hulk but then we got Professor Hulk!? They ruined Hulk.. flat out ruined. & Drax is far more powerful than what these movies suggested.,positive
This movie was all and more. It was a long movie but I never got bored. Thought things were gonna go one way and it went totally different. I will say the very end let you know what movies where coming back and hat characters wouldn't be returning. It also lets you wonder if maybe things are how they looked. I want to go see it again,positive
"I think at the core of this film is the satisfaction that culminates from the franchise of entertaining movies. Obviously, the movie gets to an emotional climax, where Iron Man loses his life, and this is done very carefully. This moment lives up to the character's reputation , and Downey is very convincing as a genuine person who saved many, but couldn't save himself in the end. The graphics are sharp, with fight scenes that live up to the predecessor's (Infinity War). The length scared me, but turns out to be used for good reason, which shows how consistent the movie is with its interesting plot. There were a few things that disappointed me in this movie, though. A common jab at the movie is the lack of importance given on Widow's death, and with this, I agree. It felt premature and honestly didn't have much of an impact on me, so I guess the writers just don't like Scarlett Johansson. Another issue is the humor........ it just didn't make me laugh, Thor, or Starlord being useless, I can let that slide but I was slightly disappointed. Anyways, a good movie, good acting, and a good swan song for a few highly respected characters.",positive
"Why is this 3 hours movie..If we talk or heard about super hero movie, only action and adventures comes in our mind.. Also Avengers get successful in box office because of action part not bcoz of storyline..after watching 3 hours I feel like I should ask for refund..what a horrible movie..",negative
My mind is racing idk what to do these movies have been my life since I was 12 I hope Thor is in guardians I wonder if they'll do movies about captain America in like Vietnam or show his life. I know their doing Disney shows. I just hope for more Thor and more guardians. Hulk had been my favorite since I was 8 or 9 and i did expect him to rematch with thanos since he wimped out in infinity war. Very disappointing hope they fix that and do something else. Thor was fat and stupid but he still kicked ass. Captain America was fire and got the ending he deserved but still selfish,positive
"So we have 22 films over 11 years started with a b film called iron man and a star looking for redemption in so many ways Robert downey jr has changed the face of cinema forever and forging a team it all started with a metal robot and he was the start and he finishes with endgame no spoilers here, just a hint on how things pan out marvel cinematic universe has made people follow their stories because there is a connection unlike dc who don't know where they are going so this last film is phase three and if your new to this don't watch this film watch the other 21 lets say a rat has saved the avengers and the rest of us a very short film indeed so the hype is worth the wait endgame is rare film that it outdoes the entire series so with thanos retired and our fallen hero's moving and having self help issues and marriages to uphold with years gone by and no way of finding thanos so with unexpected help from a past teammate they try and figure away around the universe and time difference and with stark out of the picture they come up with a plan so bring back for an almighty showdown this is a love letter from the other films in the series like extras editions to all them with thor providing light comic relief in difficult circumstances as the directors give all the hero's time to shine show their life struggles like captain America iron man pasts. for a blockbuster this has a deeply moving beating heart at the very core over three hours. With the culmination of those films chasing rocks all over the place time lines in play changing things around some people have become bitter others have choice to make who will get that one in a million shot in the heat of one hell of a battle aka take all the avengers films and put it in this final battle well how the epic showdown take place the lord of the rings style showdown and other prophecies have come to pass and hero's know it so it changing of the guard style as marvel have stayed true to the word and respected where it all started and show respect to their characters any way when thanos gets a smell of what's happing from the past can he do the thing he wants to do a break the time heist enjoy and this is 10 out of ten what series ending its sad but we will see our fallen hero's again in a different way in the future not too many spoilers here. plenty of action and good old fashion fun and take hints from age of ultron for major hints in this one",positive

Awsome Movie Great ending.i was surprised when all the avengers were gathered in one place.But it has a emotional ending.I Love You 3000 IRONMAN !,positive
OK THIS WILL HAVE SPOILERS IN IT SO IF YOU WANT KNOW SPOILERS DONT READ. Ok guys avengers endgame is a very good and exciting movie! It was very good to watch. But one problem I have is about the DEATHS of character. It's a bit upsetting to see iron man and black widow die... And captain America also turned old. So it was a bit anooying. Because a major character like IRON MAN died. I got quite a bit angry at that :/ But at least thanos died. But the movie is still really good. It's one of the most important marvel movies. And it gives a good story! It's good how they have to go back in to time to stop thanos get rid of 50% of the universe. It's a really good movie everyone should watch it.,positive

"Simply beautiful, created wonderfully, full; satisfied plot. Great ending to the first part of a monumental franchise. Leaves us emotional and impacted.",positive
"I went into this movie having only seen 1 trailer. I wanted to go into it with no expectations and even with that the movie still fell short.First off, if you're going to do time travel you either have to embrace the new changes or make sure you don't mess up the timeline. And the explanation of the offshoot realities doesn't work because you still mess your own up. So HUGE plot holes. You killed thanks before his time so basically what was the point of the previous movies?It seems the Russo brothers were hoping that we'd all feel so warm and fuzzy from the nostalgia that we would just gloss over the inconsistencies. And there was a whole lot of pandering which really didn't add to the movie.There were a bunch of slow parts which were completely forgettable and the quick parts were so quick and packed with info that you cannot remember all of that either. I honestly remember another movie I saw the week before better than avengers immediately after the ending.Overweight Thor was a joke and it went too long. It was funny for like 2 minutes, I think it would have been funnier if he had immediately gotten his muscles back because he's a God, so why wouldn't it take only a second?Captain Marvel felt out of place. Honestly she could have saved all of this if she had just shown up the first movie. Okay and I do have to say, awesome girl power in the fight but she did not need anyone else's help. I mean she had literally just blew through a ship herself, she couldn't blow through a couple of bad guys? I mean come on...Cap vs Cap fight was awesome and I wish it was longer. Funny how hearing that Bucky was still alive stopped him but yet now he wouldn't be so shocked in The Winter Soldier... so kinda messed that up too.Scott Lang was once again the best of the crew. He brings such a fresh perspective into this group of angry avengers.The movie was pretty predictable, obviously Tony was going to sacrifice himself, obviously Cap was going to pick up Thor's hammer (although the summoning of lighting was awesome), obviously Captain Marvel was going to save Tony and Nebula and come back for the big fight, obviously Cap wasn't going to come back from his last time travel, obviously Natasha was going to sacrifice herself too.The movie was fun and I laughed several times but nothing surprised me and it was still forgettable in a ton of places.There is no way this movie is a 10. I think it's a strong 6 because of the huge holes and inconsistencies. I honestly thought infinity war was way better.",positive
In the story Iron man saves the day. They take away Iron man that's like my favorite superhero. The whole going back in time thing something was missing out of the movie. The movie was funny with Thor and hulk. Hulk trying to normalize his power. It just seemed like great fight scenes all for a pointless gauntlet. Just seemed like a lot of pointless fighting. They were trying to get everyone back in the process losing two characters. Didn't like the scene with Hawkeye and black Widow. They both eagerly wanting to jump off the cliff. When all they had to do was stop Thanos from getting it in the first place. The last two movies have been really hard to follow. I had more fun going to comic con watching coz play artists bc they looked better then the characters in the movie. Robert Downey jr in one scene looked unhealthily skinny in one scene. They need better story writers. The action scenes where good but the story line just seemed off. It seems like I'm ready for them to bring in new actors and better storyline. I feel like the writers really need to dig deeper into the comics. Bring back to life and give people a glimpse of the scenes from a comic book. Stan Lee said that you know the people can make the movies anyway they wanted too. You know for a high priced film they can do better.,negative
"Many of the wars in the Avengers series were fought in New York. However, the actual shooting took place in Atlanta far more than New York. The headquarters in Avengers - End Game was also discovered by audiences. It was the US headquarters of Sany Heavy Industries near Atlanta.In addition to being the shooting location for this movie, Atlanta as the ""New Southern Capital"" , it is the headquarters of many multinational companies such as Coca-Cola. Furthermore, there are also Olympic Memorial Park and Stone Mountain Park for outdoor activities.Atlanta has four distinct climates. In winter, it is warm. In contrast, it is hot and humid in summer.",positive

"One of the fastest 3 hours of my life... and without any Doubt one of the best Experiences i've Had in Cinema in A long time, Great ending to an outstanding series.",positive
"An excellent conclusion to the current Marvel legacy. A film that had it all, Epic battle Scenes, a lot of emotions, quirky fun and even some Brains... well at least a bit despite some few logic holes you can oversee though. It must have been the biggest cast of Hollywood stars any movie ever had but I wont give away too much here. Just the central Things.... Robert Downey Jr. gives his possibly best Performance as Tony Stark here. Really great acting from the beginning to the end and he was easily the MVP of the film. Besides him Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner really got to Shine. Especially Johansson has many memorable Moments. Chris Hemsworth showed us a different Kind of Thor which was Refreshing and damn hilarious. Chris Evans was good too, had some really strong Moments. Josh Brolin was once again fantastic however not as brilliant as in ""Infinity War"". Glad to see that Gwyneth Paltrow had a Little more to do again. Surprised that Brie Larson wasn't in it as much as you would expect after her solo Adventure ""Captain Marvel"" just a month ago. Mark Ruffalo was good and Don Cheadle actually had his best ""Avengers"" appearance here. Paul Rudd was a lot of fun too. I loved how they generally approached the Story and found the perfect way to continue the very dramatic final of ""Infinity War"" offering us many even more dramatic Moments and full of surprises one would not see coming. Technically it was very outstanding too. Visually absolutely top. A film you really want to see again after it was finished and dont worry About the length... you really dont want it to end because there are so many great Moments in the film that totally keep it alive.",positive
"I had a lot of high expectations, a lot of anticipation, a lot of theories, and I was not let down at all. Yeah, there are some little nitpicks here/there, but honestly, not enough for me to not call it the perfect conclusion of the 21 movies leading up to it. Rest up, bring tissues, and wear a diaper (as Ruffalo instructed so you don't have to leave to pee, lol). Go watch and just enjoy. <3",positive
Very long and boring ..... frankly disappointed me ... I left with the thought of seeing action as in the first part ... but almost he was sleeping ...,positive

"-spoilers!--Iron man had to go talk to his dad in the past, Thor had to talk to his mom, Hawkeye got to go see his old dead girlfriend.. How convenient that all the stones were in the past directly next to the main characters loved ones. Nobody had to go hundreds of years in the past or anything? Nope all the stones were just a generation away hanging out with your parents so you could go reconnect with them and get emotional.-Tons of plot holes with time travel. We were told it creates a split in the timeline when they time travel, creating a whole new timeline. Sooo.. What happened to the old timeline they left behind to go back in time to defeat Thanos? Does this mean there is a timeline where all the superheroes abandoned the world to go back in time? And at the end when Captain America went back in time, shouldn't it have created a new timeline for him as well? Instead of him being able to meet up with them when he was old? Although this doesn't bother me as much as the other point of this review, it did make the story feel a little hollow and vague.-Felt like there was only 1 single battle sequence in this movie. Aren't there usually a few smaller battles before the final epic one? It was like 2.5 hours of drama and feelings and ""oh I miss my mom"" and only about 12 minutes of good fighting. The fighting was also so cut up, trying to give every hero a great cameo, that no fight scene lasted longer than 10 seconds without being cut. Even after Iron man gives Thanos a long pre-fight speech it only shows about 2 seconds of fighting before they cut away.-They kill Thanos in the beginning super easily, no effort, kinda upsetting. This made the entire previous movie feel like a waste. (even though it was a much better movie)-The Hulk made me cringe. They've changed his character so drastically he's not even the hulk anymore. He doesn't get angry, he doesn't regenerate (either does Captain in this movie), he doesn't smash. He's always in green form. They explain all of the above with, oh I shot myself with some gamma rays. THEN LATER WHEN HE PUTS ON THE GLOVE THEY SAY THE HULK IS PRETTY MUCH IMMUNE TO GAMMA RAYS?! Ugh. He also mentions how he was trying to fight the hulk, but then he realized the hulk is the cure. What is he the cure to if he cant regenerate anymore? I miss the old Edward Norton Hulk to be completely honest.-Personally, I hated Captain Marvel. I hate the actor, I hate the character, I hate her vague god like powers, I hate how she randomly shows up in this movie even though she wasn't in any of the others. I hate how she only shows up for a few minutes in the beginning and a few seconds at the end.-Literally the best scene in the movie is at the very end, when Thor and StarLord are arguing about who's in charge of the ship.",negative
I could not have imagined a better ending and a more befitting climatic scene to what took place. Amazing movie! 10 🌟 s,positive
"Fantasy action adventure, with emotion and comedy.Thanos wipes out half the universe at the end of the previous instalment, 5 years have passed and the remaining Avengers discover time travel in order to enable one final stand.As is normally the case, it's Tony Stark's intellect that actually determines how to crack the time travel problem, flashbacks to many of the previous films show how the hero's travel back in time to track down the Infinity Stones, which are essential to undoing the ending to Infinity War (though watching this as a standalone is very possible and still enjoyable).All the characters also depict major sacrifices and vulnerability that make you care about their eventual desperate outcomes. As time travel is a feature, it makes you wonder whether Iron Man could ever return.The epic film is a good finale that once again shows that good will eventually overcome evil. (3d uplift recommended.)",positive
"To all the haters, sit and think about the sheer amount of story, fan service, fun, epicness and sadness that tge managed to pack into 3 hours. The Russo bros had to tie up 22 movies and that is impossible, yet they pretty much pulled it off, anyone who says the price of admission wasn't worth it just for the Captain America scenes alone may as well stop watching movies. This is a tough act to follow, and a far more worthy record holder than the blue alien pocahontas rip off ever was. Keep it up Marvel, we are eagerly waiting for the next 10 years of amazing stories.",positive
This film has brought a lot of attention to the marvel cinematic universe even for those who dont particularly watch marvel are going to the cinema to see this film. It amazes audiences with every minute of the film. This is not a film you wanna miss.,positive
"This like Infinity War requires you to have seen most of the other films and your full attention. Another thing that the MCU deserves praise for (irrelevant to the film) is it has taught audiences to watch the credits, which for me are as much a part of a film as anything else, here there is no post credit scene.After half the universe is vaporised in Infinity War we are left with quite a random bunch of Avengers who are left to figure out how to regain the infinity stones.I want to say here I don't get this Captain Marvel She shows up for the first time now, when she had the power to kill Thanos. She helps kill Thanos then just clears off turns up via satalite with a new haircut? Rocky does make a sarcastic comment about this but she replies with something snotty about other planets we then don't see her again until Thanos is about to win. I don't know she just seems to me like some expensive summer signing who only plays a few games and turns up in the Champions League final scores a goal and then everyone praises. I'm going off topic here I know.The time travel rules here are that you create an alternative dimension with its own timeline so you don't mess with your own present so I also don't get the Captain America bit at the end.Anyway this is still great. The interacting with its own timeline is great. Everyone gets their moment to shine even the sidekicks who usually sit out Avengers movies.It is also fitting that Iron Man is the one who finally stops Thanos and this brings the whole thing sort of full circle. Starks death is emotional.This an excellent follow up to Infinity War. This is actually one of the best movies ive seen about teamwork.",positive
"Amazing movie, satisfies every question possible! It made me cry 😥😥 10/10",positive
"I've watched the majority of Marvel's movies/series and this movie seems to be the most boring of all of them. The storyline is predictable, the first part supposedly was meant to tell spectators how discouraged and depressed the surviving characters were, but the actors didn't do a good job there. The second action part was okay and the 3d effects were amazing. So the points go mainly for the visual effects.",positive
"With the conclusion and a massive success of Infinity War, Endgame is now more hyped than ever. But with that comes reasonable concerns. How can Endgame possibly top its prequel? What could possibly happen that will make Endgame a rollercoaster ride as Infinity War was? Well, I am happy to say, the Russos did it again. They took all our heroes on journeys we never thought we would ever see. The Russos managed to add depth and humanity to every single character ranging from heroes to villains. Adding new and interesting arcs as well as wrapping up certain arcs in such a satisfying way. Masterful movie making.",positive
"Creators tried to balance heroes personal life and heroic life in both hands but along the way they switched the hands and dropped the balls towards the ending.Instead of trying to undo Thanos's snap,they undid everything that Infinity war was good at.To sum up Endgame = 2hrs Dwell in the Past + 1hr Fight for the Future.",positive

"Given how many series there have been in the last 20 years or so, and how many of them were able to end their series in a profound way, such sublime conclusions are few and far between. Honestly, I haven't seen a better ending to a series since Return of the King (extended version, of course!), which for me, is the best trilogy of all-time.Here, we're dealing with a 22-movie story arc, which plays out almost like a miniseries on Netflix. The movies have ranged from exceptional to good to just okay. What's remarkable is how Marvel/Disney were able to map out this massive story arc so that everything worked cohesively, for the most part.Avengers Infinity War was very good, but when you add this film to it, it's solid epicness across the board! Essentially, you now have a 5 and a half hour finale that doesn't disappoint. Frankly, this entry exceeded my expectations, and I was afraid that my expectations would be too high. I'm sure glad I was wrong!As with nearly all of the films in the series, there are plenty of tongue-and-cheek moments, serious moments, etc. But this movie probably delved more deeply into the heart than any that came before it. With a 22-series story, you become invested in these characters. And the writers gambled (and won!) that they had done a good enough job to get the reactions that they'd hoped for from the audience.I'm currently living and working in Taiwan. They aren't as emotionally expressive as other cultures. But even in this theater, there were some claps, some cheers, and plenty of sniffles when the time came.Personally, Infinity War + Endgame make this the best film of the series. And it should be. In most series, the writers aren't able to come up with something that is as good as what they'd already done. With Endgame, they definitely saved the best for last!But now, you're left wondering how anything that comes after can be as good as this. The writers have set the bar very, very high. And I'm so happy that they did! All series, that are as good as this one has been (for the most part), should have an ending like this one. Except that now, it's like aiming for the moon!",positive

"Marvel did an amazing job, nothing could be better in the next phase.",positive
"Bravo. Bravo! Somehow, one of the most hyped movies of this time has exceeded my (and many others') expectation. This movie leaves a beautiful bowtie on top of the gift that was the MCU. Unlike many other superhero universes, the MCU primarily focuses on character development over the abilities or powers of the heroes. This movie is no different. The first time I watched this movie, I was on the edge of my seat, crying, laughing, cheering, and throwing my hands in the air. No other movie has ever brought about this level of emotional response in me. Somehow, I was crying even harder the second time I watched it even though I already knew what happens....",positive
Avengers Endgame is the best movie ever made. Every second of this movie is fantastic.Saw it a second time and I noticed so many new things that I did not the first time. This is really the best movie of the year so far and the best movie ever made.,positive

"One can feel this is ending the MCU infinity age.
The movie feels like a the start of the movie is ""attack of the Clones"" and the ending is ""Return of the King"" worth to se but that's also about that. Not the Epic ending that was excepted.",positive
"I never knew how much a movie could impact me like Avengers Endgame did. Not much words can explain this movie but one can and that one is ""BRILLIANT""!",positive
"While Infinity War was quite flawless, Endgame had a whole lot of loopholes.1. The movie runtime could've been reduced by a good 30 minutes. Hawkeye was given way too much screen time whereas Captain Marvel's involvement with the whole plan was missing. She was touted all this long that she's this great superhero that's gonna save the Avengers but her involvement was negligible in the film. Sure she did a couple of scenes that put the Avengers back in the fight but all of that was shown within a minute each time in a 180 minute movie.2. Didn't Nebula of the present warn Avengers about the sacrifice that the soul stone would need?3. Time travel wasn't handled very well as compared to similar films and shows like Dark. If Thanos of 2014 knows about Avengers plan in 2023, doesn't that create a divergent timeline? There are a lot of such moments that create several divergent timelines.4. It wasn't really necessary to bring every single one of the characters on screen. I would've been okay if Wakandan Queen or Jarvis or Joe Russo himself wouldn't have showed up.5. The references to the older films felt forced at times. While the elevator scene was perfect but some of the quips and easter eggs were not really needed.6. The final fight scene disappointed me a little due to the heavy use of CGI and dark settings. One thing I liked about Marvel was that their fight scenes felt real, most of them pictured in daylight. It was DECUs thing to film war scenes in an overwhelming CGI background. I was wondering at times during the last battle scene if it was really Earth. Titan in Infinity War felt more real than Earth itself in Endgame war scene.",positive
"I have to be honest I found that this movie left me wanting is so many ways. I both liked and disliked the way the hulk progressed in it.. I mean he went from angry savage to bulked up scientist .. as a result he had very lil to contribute to the movies other then comic relief. Thor was no different.. they turned the once noble and proud warrior into a fat simpering slob. Who also was lil more then comic relief.. if that The fact is that the whole movie really could have been done with out those two characters involved really. and almost was. Their roles were both so down played as a result that I am not sure the movie goers would have missed their presence in the movie. As far as Captain America and Iron man goes I found their actions predictable. The Captain Never liked being in the future... and Tony was always looking to prove to the world that he was a true hero.. and would pay the ultimate price. I was sad to see the character die but I did see it coming.
As far as Hawkeye and Black Widow go well I would like to have seen it go the other way to be honest as I rather liked the Black Widow character.
I enjoyed the growth of the characters of both nebula and gamora..
As for all the others a great many weren't even in the movie until the last 10 or so Minutes.As for the story line.. I well I found it lacking in a major way not to mention their premise behind their use of the gems... they didn't want to lose anything gained over the years.. but at the same time bring back all those lost due to Thanos. It quite literally made zero no sense I mean its kind of impossible. Its a major paradox and the truth is Tony Stark would have know that and as a result I cant see how he or anyone else in the team that would have known that would have or could have gone along with any of it. As such a thing would have been potentially more dangerous to reality then Thanos ever was or could be.",negative
"I am immensely honoured to be existing in this monumental era of time to be able to experience the vast complexity and extravagance of the MCU, as it flourished with each subsequent film. It has been one hell of a ride, but unfortunately - all good things must come to an end... and this film met this end with great success.",positive
"It seems like just yesterday that Tony Stark built his suit in the desert caves of Afghanistan - an experience that set into motion an incredible chain reaction that forever changed superhero cinematic history. 11 years and 21 movies later, fans finally got the finale they deserved in 'Avengers: Endgame.'The Russo brothers already proved their abilities to craft masterpieces that balanced character development with humor and the sleek action sequences that are expected in the Marvel Comic Universe, most recently delivering the critically acclaimed 'Avengers: Infinity War.' In 'Endgame,' they again exceed expectations, as the film is filled with more easter eggs than most kids' Easter baskets - clear signs of appreciation for the fans. Sure, the film carries an ultra-long runtime (at 181 minutes), but this length is needed in order to tie up the multiple storylines, given the number of superheroes who must squeeze in some screen time in this extravaganza. To this point, it's rewarding to see so many avengers who haven't traditionally been given the spotlight in previous films the chance to shine. And some give unexpectedly memorable performances (here's looking at you, Wanda).As a whole, 'Endgame' is not quite on the level of 'Infinity War.' Despite the third act being the most satisfying, emotionally-charged segment in the entire franchise, the overall product doesn't quite have the same lustre as its predecessor. It's the 'Return of the Jedi' to 'Infinity War's 'Empire Strikes Back.' Still, there is nothing really worth criticizing about 'Endgame,' aside from a few plot holes and the fact that its existence means many people's childhoods/young adulthoods are coming to an end.Throughout the laughs, the gasps, the tears, the smiles, 'Avengers Endgame' proves to be the thank-you note that fans didn't even realize they'd be getting. Stan Lee would certainly be proud.",positive
"There were many theories of how the remaining Avengers will reverse Thanos's snap. But I am pretty sure no one has predicted this is how the endgame would be. It is funny and emotional. This movie is one of a kind just like LOTR, Harry Potter etc. The first phase of the 180 minute long movie is slow and funny and the second phase is fast and funny with a well emotional climax for this long saga. The final battle of Endgame maybe the best battle scenes in cinematic history. The humongous cast did a well job as always and the cinematography is also perfect. Endgame was an once in a lifetime experience to me as I have watched all the 22 films over 11 years. The Avengers will continue, but it will be very hard to put something like these 3 Phases.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame
2019
Dir: Anthony and Joe Russo
Runtime: 3 hr and 1 min
Rated: PG:13
WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD
Synopsis: After the devastating events of ""Avengers: Infinity War"" the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers band together once more to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe.
Last year I wrote a pretty crummy review for Infinity War and I'm going to make up for it by doing this one the proper way. First and foremost let me say that this is truly a cinematic event, such an incredible way to bring all of these characters together for a finale that is the Infinity Saga. I really don't believe that something as grand as the MCU can be achieved after this nor do I believe that this can happen on this scale again. And I'm not even just saying this as a fan of the MCU but as a whole, the 11 years and 22 films, this was an amazing way to end the journey. So much thought was put into this storyline from day one, when Nick Fury was at Tony Stark's home and told him he's become apart of a bigger universe. This film was made for the fans with elements that the MCU is known for as well as pieces that are taken straight from the comics. But because of that it will cause some that have not been following the MCU or do not know any of the comic book history of these character won't have as much of an appreciation of the film.
Prior to the film being released the Russo brothers wanted to state that Infinity War is its own film. It's Thanos' story and they wanted that to be a complete story. The Avengers fought and Thanos won. So they wanted to make that separation that Endgame was going to be it's own film as well. They confirm this well with making the difference between Infinity War not being a ""cliff hanger"". It's portrayed so that Endgame starts it's own storyline with Infinity War being actually concluded within probably the first 30 mins of the film. Then the film continues to create a new story, its own plot line, and the characters are set up to execute their plan to save the universe. To sum it up you have the original six avengers along with Rhodey, Nebula, Ant-Man, and Rocket all still trying to put themselves back together after the events of Infinity War.
With a runtime of 3 hours I can say that the pacing of the film is pretty good. The film certainly could have been shorter but they would just be cutting out the emotional parts of the film. While in the first act of the film may seem a bit drawn out if you peel back the ""curtain"" of the MCU you see that what they were trying to portray was depression and loss. The first act of the film is spent exploring how each of these chcaracters are dealing with their failure. With the stakes being so high in Infinity War for our heroes to lose it's something they cannot live with. From Cap holding grief meetings about the ones that vanished in the decimation to Natasha having a small group of Avengers still trying to do good in the world. Before the second act is in motion there is a bit of prelude to the second act. While the rest of the Avengers have pretty much lost everything Tony Stark has gained and leading up the stakes for him are as high as they've ever been. The second act is like a walk down memory lane of the MCU. While time travel plays a pivotal part in the story its used to build up the finale. You get to see some great revisited scenes from the earlier MCU films. At first it seems like all is going according to plan when a rock is thrown into the plan which causes Cap and Ironman to adjust accordingly which gives a great almost tribute to the past of the two characters. Oh and speaking of time travel in the beginning of the second act the rules of time travel for this film are explained. So just know ahead of time that it does not follow the standard rules of cinema time travel. The third act of the film is the grand finale and it acts as a finale to the story arc of the Infinity saga. We get our showdown we've been waiting for along with the perfect send off for some of the core characters that couldn't have been done better. Considering most of the film is CGI it looks really really good. There is a scene toward the end where the CGI looks a bit choppy even on IMAX I saw it but if your not looking for it you won't notice it. The casting and characters are all on point with everyone playing the roles they've been playing for years now along with most of these actors being veterans in their own right. I've read a few articles already with talks of RDJ getting a nomination for the Oscars which I could see happening and would be amazing. Most of the time the only time these films win or get nominated it's for music or VFX. I really think RDJ could get a nomination for his role as Ironman in this. I would recommend this for anyone that's a fan of the franchise or the comics. Very small kids maybe not so much considering it's so long and the story is a little intricate. Absolutely a theater watch and I really feel bad for anyone that didn't get to experience this opening night.
5/5 Easily. I've only talked to a few people that didn't like the film but as I said before those are usually the ones that either haven't read the comics or haven't been keeping up with the MCU films. It's really remarkable that we live in a time where technology has caught up with my childhood dreams of seeing these characters on screen. Seeing Cap pick up that damn hammer and say ""Avengers assemble"" it was like seeing something I've wanted out of these films all along but didn't know it until it actually happened. This film isn't really to be seen and broken down as a film on its own but as an ending to an era that has been built up for the last 11 years.

"Such well written time travel script inrelate to different marvel movies and time period with refference so good old memories ,
Apart from bit slow start (which is quite acceptable) ,when the script takes pace movie will be full in action and thoroughly engaging.Cliamx was damn of lit, which is the best so far that a ending sequeal can demand.Apart from movie facts, politically marvel took a strong step of centralising and impact of women characters in action sequens and even in climax scenes too.When its final sequel to series to get the utmost satisfaction must watch prior ones too.",positive
"Feeling bad for tony though, This was hell of show. Well done marvel👍",positive
"I was a bit excited for this title given that I really like the previous one but I ended up a bit disappointed... It's often very versatile from one Marvel to another.
I found the characters' decision not really making sense in many occasions and the plot ended up not making that much sense anymore I found.",positive
"To me Endgame is not the absolute perfect movie but sure as hell is the perfect ending to a great arc
Don't think they could have made a better movie
Great job
Love watching it as a marathon with Infinity War makes it even better.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is by no means a bad movie. It's a very entertaining film, and the conclusion was perfect for the MCU. However, Endgame is a 3-hour film! It felt like I was running a 10K marathon. This is coming from someone who watched Schindler's List (1993), Titanic (1997), and Zach Snyder's Justice League (2021). Act 1 was slow in this one.I had to rewatch Endgame three more times to make sure I didn't miss anything. Avengers: Infinity War (2018) was the textbook example of quantity and quality. It was the perfect balance of both.As for Endgame, there was more quantity than quality to be found. The time travel plot was convoluted. Not everyone liked fat Thor as well. Some have argued that his new look ruined his character as the God of Thunder. I'm on the fence on that one. Iron Man's sacrifice was perfect.For a comic book film, the film's length for this grand finale is understandable. It's exactly why I couldn't give Endgame anything lower than a 7/10. The last 30 minutes of this movie offers some of the best superhero footage we'll ever see on screen from terrific actors and MCU writers. Simply put, it was exciting.If I had to rank all the Avengers movies in order from best to worst, this would be my personal list: Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers (2012), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).Love it or not hate it, Endgame was so messy that it made Ultron better by comparison. The second installment was less tedious to sit through. For many fans, Endgame marked the end of not only Phase 3 of the MCU, but the end of the MCU as well. Phase 4 was hot garbage. These movies aren't the same without Captain America and Iron Man.",positive
"Not sure if it's a good idea to write a review here, as it seems, that Fanboys are rating down carefully considered reviews, just because they are not praising endgame, but so be it.I was not really disappointed, but I was also not stunned by this movie. It had a lot of shortcomings, logic-flaws and humor that simply wasn't funny or jokes that were somehow not fitting into the storyline. Some characters developed in a direction, I personally did not like and the overall ending to the movie seemed rushed and somehow chaotic.Overall it was a decent ending to this MCU phase, but as always, it's down to personal preference if you like a movie or not or if you wished for a different storyline.There are too many things, that were illogical:
Nebula not telling the guys what it takes to get the soul stoneTony Stark not even questioning why Pepper is in the end-fight and not taking care of their childrenDepressed, fat ThorCaptain America being able to use Thor's hammerCaptain America living a life with his girlfriend without someone remembering it in their timelineAll of a sudden, all dead heros appear out of nowhere - all coming from Wakanda - how the heck did they know and gather in the first place?If you haven't seen Captain Marvels end credit-scene, Captain Marvel would appear right out of nowhere in this movie and everyone would wonder why.Thor being depressed and fat and this Softie-Version of Hulk were the main character developments I also did not like.Personally didn't like Tony Stark being killed, but one saw that coming. After all, his story was told. Captain America living another live at least got him a happy end, although and illogical one. The hairstyle of captain Marvel ... ok, let's not talk about this one.There are certain scenes that are indeed epic, overall, the movie was entertaining, but I honestly liked Infinity War more.Cannot tie this to specfic reasons, it's a combination of all the aforementioned elements, that simply didn't do the trick for me to make it an epic movie.Considering myself being a big fan of the MCU franchise, I think all fans should see it, but if you are at least somehow interested in a decent and logic storyline, be warned you might not be too overwhelmed by this movie.",negative
"What a remarkable journey it is for Marvel Cinematic Universe. I don't think anything can accomplish this kind of achievement in another franchise universe. This is indeed one of a kind.To everyone contributing in the making of this universe, producers, story writers, directors, actors, CGI makers, and everyone involved, from the bottom of my heart, I say thank you very much for the experience, the sensation, the excitement, the wonders you guys brought to the movies..",positive
"I cried in at least 5 points of the film, some tears of joy and some of sorrow. Seriously go watch it now. Or if you haven't watched the previous 21 MCU films, watch them now and then go watch Endgame. A truly incredible finale.",positive
"I grew up with these movies and invested my time and money on watching every single marvel movie to this date. And boy they didn't disappoint. Such an amazing (bit heartbreaking) farewell to RDJ and Chris Evans. I hope they'll contribute to explore the stories of Natasha, Thor, Bruce and Clint. Love the movie so much and planning to watch it again soon. The last fight was so epic and had so many iconic moments. I am glad that they brought all major characters to this movie. Truly epic. Waiting to see what they will do after the endgame.",positive
"Warning: There be SPOILERS ahead!This movie is absolutely amazing and everything popcorn movies have evolved to be. The monumental achievement in the storytelling arc over the course of these past ten years is unprecedented and mind blowing in its audacity and brilliance. Over twenty films and over ten years of groundwork laid. In such sprawling, epic storytelling oft times the landing is the hardest thing to stick. This movie hits that landing perfectly. They call it 'Endgame' but really this is Infinity War part 2. I have already started to hear backlash over the movie and in my mind the people who don't like this film just actively want to dislike it. Haters gonna hate. This film gives the original Avengers a glorious send off giving them all their moments. There are stunners such as Black Widow's sacrifice which I don't think many saw coming, as well as the almost immediate killing of big bad Thanos. There are expected tearjerking moments with Tony's heroic death which most of us figured was going to happen. There were unexpected hilarious moments such as Big Lebowski Thor and rousing hero moments such as Cap taking up Meow Meow. Some might get too far down the rabbit hole regarding the time travel implications, and are there things that can probably be picked apart with that? Sure, but this is a comic book film after all and subject to some degree of comic book science thus when they explain it you are just supposed to nod your head and take it as a given. The film gets wonderfully meta and is almost an homage unto itself as the time travel has our heroes going back and visiting previous moments in the history of the MCU in an effort to reacquire the infinity stones in a last ditch effort to undo the Thanos snap. Time travel utilizing the quantum realm was a not an unexpected plan for setting the MCU right, but then to toss in the unexpected chaos of past Thanos figuring out what was going on and becaming the prevalent enemy once again journeying to the future where the Avengers have collected all the stones for him was a master stroke of devilish genius. That leads to an astounding battle in which just about every MCU character to date plays a role. I loved Spidey's Iron Spider instant kill mode. I absolutely adored the moment they gave Captain America at the end returning the stones (presumably), but then instead of returning to our time he went back to spend a life with Peggy Carter, finally getting that long awaited dance, and showing back up in our timeline as an old man with his life lived passing on the mantle of Captain America to Sam. Equally meaningful is giving Tony's death such gravitas as he is gets one over on Thanos placing the Infinity Gauntlet in his hand and mocking Thanos uttering the ""I am Iron Man"" slogan that harkens back to MCU film number one and how he began this whole sordid journey and now here he has come full circle to end it with those defiant words and snap of his own. The special effects here are almost an afterthought, but really attention should be paid because they did an amazing job. The action sequences were all great but really what excelled here were the various aging/deaging effects and the like. Haggard Tony looked great, along with young Michael Douglas and old Cap among others. This felt like the ending that these characters deserved and this story deserved. There will continue to be Marvel films and there will even be Avengers films in the future, but who knows if they will be able to recapture the magic they generated in this first era of MCU films. This was most certainly an ending for our intial collection of Avengers heroes although these are comic book movies so never say never, but for our purposes here this is really the end of an era and it couldn't have been displayed with more care and poignancy. Full to the brim with action, emotion, drama, excitement and laughs this is exactly why spectacle summer blockbusters exist, and this very well may be the rare popcorn movie that garners Oscar buzz at the end of the year, and deservedly so. Even with a few minor flaws or perhaps some story gripes here or there I still rate this as one of the best films among a slew of superlative movies. Congratulations to these assembled Avengers and congratulations to the brilliant production that Kevin Feigie put together.Eric's Grade: A.",positive
"I laughed, I got teary eyed, I cheered, among many feelings. This film was a perfect culmination of the past 10/11 years. With call backs to every MCU movie, with many surprises and moments this film is just as epic as people are hyping it up to be.
20/10",positive
"The story starts out strange but in the end you realize that the entire film was worth it. Everyone goes through their changes. Everyone's arcs are completed.Tony gets to have a daughter and finally makes the true sacrifice. Steve finally gets his dance with Peggy. Thor gets to be on his own because he realizes he is not a leader. Bruce gets to fix the problems he has with Hulk finally at peace. So on and so forth.But the final battle is basically every fans dream. Big battles that go on and its just amazing. Cap gets Thor's hammer in worthiness. Tony finally has the ultimate sacrifice. Everyone comes back to life. And of course this will go down as one of the greatest movie lines ever ""Avengers...Assemble."" Pure awesomeness.",positive
"Endgame, the last movie in the Infinity saga. Set's up an amazing final showdown with the purple brute himself.It also wraps up the story lines of multiple veteran characters very will. This movie aims to please. Every fan will be satisfied.",positive
"This is the best movie I have watched till now. I will rate it 10 out of 10. There was so much excitement so much surprise so much action and the last thing which broke heart, emotion. Only the real fan will understand how much it broke heart. But it was needed to get 10 out of 10. As it is spoiler free I can't tell anything more but one thing, I have watched the movie in hall print then think how will it be in 1080p blue-ray.
At Iast I wanna say the incredible last sentence ""I am Iron-man.""❤💝💝❤",positive
"Not enough action
Not enough Spider-ManWell not enough word for making a review",positive
They open the story and characters very widely so closing the chapter was a mess. Too much drama (poor one) main characters was missing. They gave role of Thor to captain america and hulk as carton green man. Worst avengers and really it's an end game (just a game).,negative
"Never before has a film had such a build up of character development spanning so many characters over such a long period of time and so many films. It's truly an amazing feat and with so much build up it would have been easy to fumble, but the Russo Brothers really pulled this one off. Amazing plot with the perfect amount of fan service and pay off built in. I will never forget the reaction and experience seeing this at the cinema.This film has me in tears every time I watch it and ties up the infinity saga perfectly. Love the ending Captain America gets which is well and truly deserved. All round perfect film.",positive
"This movie had me crying so much after seeing it but it also very awesome. When Cap lifted Thor's hammer I was shocked and geeking out over it. I was also geeking out when Spider-Man came back cause his death was the saddest in Infinity War. But I am really sad that Iron Man will not be doing anymore Marvel movies, I am excited to see what Robert Downey Jr. has planned for the future.",positive
"Prefection x 100.I mean we have reached the ending of phase4 perfectly
so intruged to see what else is in holds.",positive
This is a complete film that completes a Phase of 22 films. The Marvel Universe gets a closure to the Infinity Saga. The film couldn't be more better. it is simply flawless . It is an experience. Just go and watch it and enjoy,positive
"Well what can I say! I was late to the party with this final instalment on the Avengers franchise. Over the years I've look forward like a school kid waiting for the next film to come out,bland waiting to see what happens next. This didn't disappoint. I'm sure if and when I watch this film again I will see glimpses into other characters and films I haven't thought about it didn't realise as that seems to be the norm now. As ever a cheeky cameo from the creator to add a bit of humour to a sometimes very dark and serious film. Although that's the Avengers all wrapped up I feel there will be something else to takes it's place just around the corner.",positive
"Unlike infinity war (IF), the jokes in endgame were simply not as funny. The 2 standout drax lines and the Okoye 'why was she inside all this time' lines were laugh out loud moments in IF, whereas there weren't really many in endgame. I feel like the first 2 hours of the film did drag, yet I do understand they were summing up 12 years of films and a lot of character development. Left the 'soul world'/ orange baby gamora place undiscussed, didn't see hulk in battle, got over black widows death really quickly, etc. Feel there was a more emotional attachment in IF. Certain massive moments in cinematic history but not an excellent film",positive
"Overall, I'm very satisfied with this movie. It was incredibly ambitious, taking risks that I didn't think it could possibly take. It was also obviously emotional being that this is a goodbye to some characters and a huge story line that has been set up since 2008. This movie also has the most epic final battle that I've seen in any movie, and anybody who sits through that wont be disappointed.With that being said, this movie definitely has some pacing problems. There were some moments that kind of lagged. And while this movie takes some risks, not all of them pay off. To be honest, some of the risks this movie took with the plot kind of left me a little confused., but the good out ways the bad and we've gotten a very satisfying conclusion to an incredible group of movies.",positive
Please watch..... best film I have watched in my life,positive
"It's one of the movies that involves for the first time 'time travel' by making changes in past by altering quantum realm. The science even if correct has its set back. The time traveler is not automatically aware of things as they occurred (the changes).For me the movie scores negative after infinity war, but it did not happen while viewing. It happened after researching the fate of Iron man and vision. Until that time it was epic for me, as I thought the fate of Universe can be altered but not changed and from what Iron man did it killed whole bunch of other people. All these combined with (to add further) fate of Captain America and Black Widow made my experience unique. After research it was that iron man ended the lives of only Thanos and his army, degrading the movie experience.The story tricks you into remembering events of past, this is where it creates an epic experience for a fan audience. As far as I am considered, I feel it to be a shortcut. Ahhh... I am kidding even I liked it.Final Verdict: It's a joy ride for fan Audience.",positive
"Never ever use timetravel to resolve or fix anything, when you start to see or use timetravel to fix the past then you enter uncharted land where anything is possible if it make sense or not.So you killed my father I will timetravel to kill your father that you dont get born but hey cant you timetravel to kill my father so I dont get born but why you then want to kill my father?Can we sure that every change in the past will not split a new present so no matter what I fix in the past it wont change my present thus creating another present where I habe no access too.This can go on and on and on so even this movie could play 24h each solution for anyhing can be changed and unfixed with next time travel step.For this movie I can say only no matter how it ends who knows if in next movie some timetravel will unwind and we are square one or in just random mess.Because of timetravel you must disconnect to anything because no matter what happens it can be rewinded and changed with a complete different outcome.I am glad I didnt have to pay money for thiss mess.",negative

About the highest praise I can give this movie is that it surprised me after twenty one films to set it up. Three hours and you won't want it to end.,positive
"Two weeks after it launched I finally watched Endgame tonight. I somehow managed to avoid all spoilers and while I expected/guessed/theorized the one main death right at the end I was still rocked by it.
Endgame covers all the emotions, allows each story arc to play out, has great battles, fantastic score that blends really well with the scenes.
For me, this movie is nearly flawless.",positive
"'Avengers: Endgame' (or ""Avengers 4"") is the culmination of 21 films of inter-connected storytelling and while it's not the best film ever made (although it may end up the highest-grossing), it is certainly a fitting conclusion to one of cinemas most ambitious undertakings. If you haven't seen enough Marvel films to understand what's going on (what have you been doing!?), you'll still probably enjoy this, but a lot of backstory and character knowledge is assumed. This film follows on directly from 'Avengers: Infinity War', but it definitely helps if you've seen 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' and 'Captain Marvel' since then.OK, some things that will help outline the film, but I don't think are spoiler: Scott/Ant-Man (Rudd) and Clint/Hawkeye (Renner) get plenty of screen time, seeing as they weren't in 'Infinity War'. Natasha/Black Widow (Johansson) and Bruce/Hulk (Ruffalo) also have a bit more to do, which is fitting, giving all the original Avengers time to shine. Thor (Hemsworth) still gets plenty of great jokes. But, as always, this is the Steve & Tony show, with Steve/Captain America (Evans) and Tony/Iron Man (Downey Jr.), reconnecting and leading the Avengers as they try to undo what Thanos (Brolin) did to the universe in 'Infinity War'.Plot-wise, I don't think it's a spoiler to say there's some time travel involved. It's not totally out of the realms of what we've seen happen in other films, so you can go along with it. This obviously leads to some funny throw-backs/sentimental moments with other characters. Some of the start/middle is a bit of a slog, but it's all set-up for the end, and they can't be too happy & having fun after what happened. The final act is very satisfying, but also quite emotional and sad in parts. It's handled quite well. FYI: No credit scenes at all, so feel free to go to the bathroom after the 3 hours are up!",positive

Whether it was amazement,laughter or sadness endgame did everything right lets get into what makes this film such a masterpiece and a massive triumph for marvel.First of all i have to start with what is expected with marvel considering its massive budget its stunning and creative visuals and action sequences. This film was so pleasing to the eye, with its bold and vibrant colours to its creative set designs, marvel went all out for this blockbuster of a movie. And also the film was just entertaining, even casual fans or new fans would enjoy the film as there is just so much to enjoy throughout the film. And the action sequences were so large scale and creative it really made you watch in awe in many places.Next this film was hilarious. I have been loving marvels recent comedic touch to there films as it just adds a bit more flavour and charm to the movie. The main source of comedy came from Korg and Thor as well as ant man. To see fat Thor was interesting to say the least and for whatever reason really made me chuckle on many occasions throughout.But also another positive and the complete opposite side to the rollercoaster would be the films emotional depth. There was so many deep themes about suffering loss and moving on which was tough and heartwarming to see. And to see the deaths of black widow and iron man were truly heartbreaking and even made me get emotional which is a rare occurrence this film really did make you feel every emotion.Next this film was exceptionally acted. My key standouts would have to be Chris evans,Robert downey jr,Jeremy renner and scarlett johansson. They all put so much passion into there characters that the emotional scenes involving them hit much harder also the scripts they were given were fantastic with some exceptional dialogue, which really added to the believability of the scenes so you could imagine how those characters were feeling i could even say these were awards worthy acting performances in some cases. Also Josh Brolin was fantastic as thanos again you almost believed that Thanos was a real person thats how good his character design and acting performance was.Next the film had many fantastic plot twists. This film really kept your mind thinking about whats going to happen next, some things that happened were so unexpected that nowone should come into the film with any theories. The biggest plot twist for me was how quickly and easily Thanos was killed!( well the present day version)Next the film had fantastic narrative character developments between many characters. The film added depth to so many different characters it really made the film so much more interesting. My favourites have to be hawkeye. Seeing how he coped with losing his family to the snap and what he was willing to do to get them back was heartwarming to see. But My favourite has to be Iron man, To see him willing to give everything up for pepper, and to see them take care of a child together was one of my favourite and most heartfelt moments of the film, Robert downey jr has done so much for marvel and his character arc throughout the film was the reward for this.Also the film did well with setting up future phase 4 movies. I already knew before watching the film that most of the dust characters would return due to them having future films in the franchise. But just to get the confirmation of there return was a great moment in the film. And to see that Thor and Gamora would be back for guardians 3 it really made me excited for the future of marvel.Next i really loved the reintroduction of all the characters from across all the whole 10 years, and also the scenes that included previous films. Seeing all the characters that some casual fans might of forgotten about would really be nostalgic and exciting to see. It really felt that everyone was involved as a whole project. Also i loved when everyone went back in time to the 1st avengers and thor and guardians. It was a nice but welcome surprise to see.Just one little nitpick that i did not like about the film would be Brie Larsson/captain Marvel. I still did not connect to or take a shine to her character. And there is just something so dislikable about Brie larsson with her over the top personality and extreme feminism. I thought her haircut throughout the film was stupid, and she was to over-relied on to save everyone which annoyed me as better characters could of done her job but luckily she was not in the film much so this did not cloud my judgement of the film.Also every single character got there individual moments to shine. Considering the largeness of the cast this was very impressive to see, but they somehow managed to achieve this within a 3 hour timeframe and it made you appreciate all the different characters powers and personalities. Also i fairly enjoyed the all female superhero team in the end sequence. Yes you can argue this was to push a feminist political message but i thought it was pretty cool and considering the controversy that captain marvel caused with its feminist message this was needed.And finally the ending was the most satisfying end to a 10 year wait. The final act literally gave me goosebumps, the sheer scale of the battle and the action that was shown to us was so impressive. Also I loved the endings that they gave many of the original avengers. My favourite being Captain America reunting with peggy and living there life together this was beautiful to see.Overall avengers endgame was the perfect film, where marvel did nothing wrong and tied all the loose ends to an amazing 10 years and which should be the biggest film of all time and a possible awards contender and respect for superhero movies.",positive
"Since 2008's ""Iron Man"" we have witnessed Marvel Studios release a cinematic jigsaw puzzle culminating with ""Avengers: Endgame"", its final piece. We have been introduced to many characters, seen a variety of storylines and invested in the many films the studio has released over this 11-year span. If you have been a complete and loyal fan of these films, Endgame is your ultimate reward. Because of the anticipation, the risk of ruining the many surprises the film holds and the chance of you going into the film with too much knowledge of its plot, I will not divulge a single aspect of its story. I am only going to attempt to give my final conclusions in the vaguest way I can.
If you haven't heard, the film clocks in at 3 hours, one minute. A truly daunting and risky gamble of the filmmakers, Anthony & Joe Russo, because no other film of this genre has been this epic in length. In some ways it helps the film and, in some ways, it hurts it as well. The first act of the film, an hour to hour and half, is rather slow paced. It says some things that has to be said as well as sets up many important aspects that will come to play later in the film, but trust me this part of Endgame is not the action roller-coaster that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" was, but it also doesn't involve as many characters and storylines as that film did (something that was many people's chief complaint). The first act could have been trimmed, written at a better pace or even had some more excitement added to it but that isn't my biggest complaint about this part of the film. For me one of my biggest problems with how comic films have been adapted to the big screen is their propensity to alter the very fabric of established characters and rewrite them to become very different than what I knew them to be when I followed them as a young comic reader. Without naming who they are, we find drastic differences and changes with some of the characters. Some I found to be interesting, others I found troubling and one, although done in the comics when I was still reading them, was a big disappointment. I will even go so far as to say how that superhero was treated creatively in the script in this and the previous film, is one of the most disappointing aspects of the films.
The film picks up the pace and its entertainment value in the second act, the part of the film I really loved. If I say too much you will have some huge surprises ruined, but I will say if you are a fan of the previous films in the Marvel Universe, it will be a huge treat for you. Throughout the film, a common element that has been persistent in the Marvel movies is the use of humor and this film is no different. The laughs come all thought this film but I think the jokes worked the best during this part of the film. The action picks up as well as the overall pace. Most of the scenes in the section make the movie worth the price of admission. It might be the section of the film that will be please the fans the most and even helps alleviate some of the first acts' mistakes.
By the time we get to the film's epic final act you might be a little worn and weary, but trust me when I tell you it is a cinematic achievement rarely seen. Fans will be cheering, and its probably the part of the film I would recommend seeing with other Marvel fans. Like the previous parts of the film, there are some surprises and laughs. But I will also contend that it had one flaw, not enough to ruin the film, but certainly a true complaint and I will just mention it with a hint; the end felt like Peter Jackson directed it.
Overall, I will say I would recommend ""Avengers: Endgame"" for obvious reasons, if you have followed the previous Marvel films it is an absolute must see. If you have missed many of the films and are one of the very few that hasn't seen ""Avengers: Infinity War"", I would actually recommend you wait until you know more about the storyline, you will truly be lost. I wasn't dismayed with the film, just certain aspects and smaller details. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a fitting end in many ways and will overall leave you satisfied. Some will probably walk away thinking it is one of the greatest comic superhero films ever made, I wasn't but that's ok. We all have our own taste and opinions.",positive
So disappointing. The first hour was a complete snooze-fest and what they did to Thor and the Hulk were sickening. Lots of plot holes. The girl power stuff at the end was cringeworthy. Did this movie even have the same writers and Director as Infinity War??SPOILER ALERT:Hawkeye as a badass assassin was ridiculous and Gwyneth Paltrow in IM armor made me throw up in my mouth a little,negative
"I went to this movie opening night with some friends and loved it. Went again a week later with my brother and parents. My parents are not people who really love superhero movies, but both of them loved this movie. Seriously, everyone should go see this movie, at least once. There is a 99% chance you will like it",positive
"No spoilers....and please don't spoil for others as well. It is a movie that you must watch if you are mcu fan. Overall movie is amazing, nicely directed and great mix of comedy and emotions just like other mcu movies 😍👌🏻",positive
"'Avengers: Endgame' continues from its previous instalment 'Avengers: Infinity War', where a chain of catastrophic events destroyed half the universe. The remaining Avengers now come together for one final time to reverse the actions of the evil Thanos and restore the order of the universe. But will they succeed?
Overwhelming. It best describes the final chapter that culminates Marvel Cinematic Universe's 21 iconic films into one. And that also describes the experience of watching your favourite superheroes come together for a singular goal, for one last time. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo ensure that the humongous build-up and the avalanche of expectations do not get the better of them. They deliver a largely wholesome product that is full of moments laced with action, emotion, comedy and drama. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely take you along, even if you haven't been following the franchise. They do an incredible job with the screenplay to balance emotions with visual spectacle. So if you're not a fan yet, chances are, you might become one after watching this instalment.While the screen time for each character is not equal, their significance in the story is. And there are enough surprises in store, as far as their fates are concerned. 'Endgame' delivers quite well on the emotional quotient, bringing out superpowers and vulnerabilities of its cinematic demigods through their measured performances. From an upright Captain America (Chris Evans) to a stoic Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and from a straight-faced Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) delivering the punches to the reassuring presence of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), 'Endgame' has it all and a lot more. Thanks to the conviction in performances, you also might just find yourself rooting for the bad guy, Thanos (Josh Brolin) at some point. However, it's the comic collective of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Ant Man (Paul Rudd) that ensures there are enough lighter moments in this otherwise heartfelt finale.
The action becomes progressively intense, but never overbearing. In fact, it remains relevant and true to the narrative, such that it weaves in enough opportunities for major plot twists that even the diehard fans may not see coming. The extensive CGI work adds to the visual appeal, even in 2D.
For the non-fans, the film's explanatory tone might come across as a speed breaker at times, but for the fans, the same invokes hope and excitement, leading to constant gasps and howls.
Overall, 'Avengers: Endgame' is a befitting tribute to the Cinematic Universe that has spawned larger-than-life superheroes and super fans. At three hours plus, 'Endgame' delivers on a lot of its hallmark promises, leaving its fans with a range of emotions and fond memories.",positive
"To say the least, it brought so many story lines together and had brought the MCU to a rebirth of sorts. Saddening parts like the loss of Tony Stark and the end of Steve Roger's reign as Captain America. 10/10 . ( I would have given it a 12/10 but the scale doesn't go high enough). Amazing, well thought out and emotional movie.",positive
"Mind. Blown.If I could tell my 19-year-old self discovering superhero comics in college exactly how good their big screen adaptations would become, I wouldn't believe me.I saw ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) tonight with expectations that were very high. It was still better than I thought it would be. It was easily better than last year's ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (although I think of them as two halves of the same epic movie). I don't pretend to be a film expert, so take this as speculation - I personally think the pair of ""Infinity"" films have made comic-book movie history in the same manner as the original ""Superman"" (1978), Tim Burton's ""Batman"" (1989) and Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy (2005-2012).I don't really want to make any more observations, because I'm too afraid of inadvertently posting spoilers. But I will say that there is a massive tonal change between ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame."" The banter and humor of the former is largely left aside, and this concluding story is darker and far more emotionally sophisticated. It's moving. It feels strange to write here, but I kept thinking during the movie that this was a more ""grown up"" Marvel film.And it is EPIC. I honestly can't imagine how Marvel can top it with future films. There is an action set piece that made my jaw drop. I can't say more.This is an obvious 10 out of 10 from me.",positive
"Is it really over? Still couldn't believe all my super heros are leaving the big screen. At first, I was worried what the script would be like? Three hours movie? It seems long... However, after watching the movie, 3 hours not enough, wish it is longer! Because so many characters and so many stories that need conculsion. It is unbelievable how many great actors/actress are involved in this movie, many of them just appear for a few seconds. There are so many loyal Marvel fans around the world. It is indeed an awesome franchise!",positive
"Redundant plot, unnecessary long, unexplainable events and meaningless humour!",positive
"Needed more Dr. Strange action! Felt like the final fight scene with Thanos could've been choreographed a lot better especially when you have a magic caster who could dish out different spells like Dr. Strange. But alas, he was instead given the duty of holding off the impending doom from crashing down on his team.",positive
The film with the number of heros it shows looks like a show? Each want to say I am here in the film ! Nothing new ? It seems media played a lot in creating a mass positive thinking ! Long for 3 hours. A lot of talk that can be removed without affecting the film story? Its a kids film.,positive
"What I'm mad about the most is the fact that now I am too disgusted to watch a movie from the past again and i have watched most of them 2-3 times already. Way to ruin everything.
I think introducing Captain Marvel was the worst decision. Black Captain America will never make the screens and i doubt they can make a Natasha movie DC dark.",negative
"I loved the movie soo much especially in 3D, it was everything that we didn't think we want but we need. The ending was in fact satisfying as Chris Evans said in an interview. This the only movie I rated it 10 because it gave us everything we expected and more.",positive
"I have scrolled through the reviews for this movie and been gently and mildly amused at how opinions about this film yo-yo much the same as this cinematic presentation. I could detail a whole laundry list of things I enjoyed about this movie, but I have observed that other reviewers have done this extensively and so I want to concentrate on personal impressions at this time. Later on, we can talk about scientific howlers concerning Time Travel and relativistic physics and quantum mechanics.First of all, I am a member of the group who grew up with and lived through the Marvel Age of Comics. I fully understand and remember vividly how this all started and now where it has finally arrived. I understand with absolute clarity and certainty how Darth Vader is actually an extrapolation of Doctor Doom and in the end a recapitulation of his origin story. This being true no matter what George Lucas says about the benefits he derived from his mentor Joe Campbell, which is also evidently beyond dispute.I remember idly considering while collecting DC comics how I wished there was a style of comic book writing and illustration that was more dramatic, structured around greater conflict and a bit more virile and witty. That was when I discovered Marvel Comics. I felt like life was giving me what I was dreaming about. Following the chronology and evolution of the Marvel Experience has simply affirmed and strengthened my conviction that what you imagine can actually come true.AVENGERS: ENDGAME is everything a bunch of scrappy ghetto kids cracked wise about and exulted over between games of lob baseball. This while hearing some neighborhood child from across the street tell us that our mother just said we should come home now that it was getting dark. We who started out with this experience are simply amazed and delighted with how far and wide this phenomena has expanded. We remember the cheesy fan buttons and the little red vinyl records for the Merry Marvel Marching Society and Stan's Soapbox. I remember how, reading about Doctor Strange and his redemption from his own arrogance, as well as Prince Namor: The Submariner finding his way back to his long lost Kingdom, helped fuel and catalyze my own desire to be a writer. I also remember the Pandora's Box I opened up when I first assayed to learn How To Draw Comics The Marvel Way. Through it all, Stan Lee kept promoting and building with others what is now a vast public relations machine and went on to the Great Beyond having conferred to us a profound legacy in Literature and Art along with Jack Kirby and an immense cadre of other artists and writers.I finally can say this while now in my advanced age; being willing to admit after taking Ann Wilkinson's class in Child Literature at Wayne State University that almost any good children's book is usually superior in thematic content to your average comic book. The fact that I can now say this without anyone having to wrestle me to the floor, strikes me as a major turning point in my own maturation.I watched AVENGERS: ENDGAME and felt a significant chapter of my life coming successfully to a close. The baroque ranging in Time and Space between screams and witty asides was everything I dreamed the Marvel experience could be in my youth and then some. Even the speculation of Captain America about what life would be like simply married to Sharon Carter as an ordinary Joe seemed oddly fitting in this wacky universe where anything can happen and you can hear the Mighty Thor burping over his beer belly from too much ale.I also found myself reflecting on Rob Bryanton and his ideas in IMAGINING THE TENTH DIMENSION: A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT TIME AND SPACE as I was watching this movie. This is the spirit of the best of Juvenile Science Fiction. That it lightly touches on ideas and themes that can be explored more deeply later in a salutary way and lead to greater growth and development.When we came to the rousing finale, I felt that my conviction that life can be what you imagine it to be was finally successfully rewarded and my faith in this belief irrefutably validated.The Marvel Universe has landed, and so can yours, too.Deal with it.",positive
"Well, ""Avengers: Endgame"" was quite a movie. Full of action, loads of CGI {Too much to fully take in}, and an interesting storyline; It certainly was ""crunch time"". I did actually enjoy this movie, although not as much as the previous instalment. ""Endgame"" is however a decent film, full of twists and turns, and now Marvel has matured, the end is an emotional farewell. Great film, enjoy.",positive
"This film occupies a special place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The apogee of all the stories, expected not only by fans, but also by those who fell in love with the studio's films, even without being fans of comics. The ""Finale"" was well prepared by all the previous projects and completed the whole saga, leaving the audience with mixed feelings.The wait for the film was long and painful. You bet. At first, we were prepared for the ""Infinity War"", promising to roll up a strong denouement there (it turned out to be only a strong denouement of the film, but not the whole story), then the waiting time for the fourth Avengers dragged on. And in the frame again favorite and excellent actors: Downey Jr., Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Evans, Johannson, Renner. Everyone is gorgeous in their role, we watch the characters with trepidation and anxiety.The beginning of the film is discouraging. Everything that happened in the last film is true, people live after losing their dearest. Atmospheric, depressing, on a grand scale. Robert's game is very memorable. He's not an Iron Man anymore. He is the one who fought against injustice all these years, but suffered a crushing defeat and lost a boy who trusted him completely. And this Tony Stark, exhausted and exhausted, is ready to accept his death, resigned to the fact that he will not see his beloved again. The farewell message touches to the depths of your soul, you literally feel the icy space around you and the inevitability of the emptiness of death.Then Downey's game again. Gorgeous. In a skirmish with Cap, he says a lot of important and correct things, plays like the last time. His hero is broken and crushed, and there is only enough strength left to be angry. And this anger, self-confidence, of course, does not allow him to objectively see the existing situation. Cap is also right in his own way. But now there is no difference.Each character is well spelled out. It perfectly shows how everything changes years after the terrible click. Natasha is broken and has no desire to fight, Thor generally goes on a regular binge, turning into a morally crippled Asgardian, Banner seems to have learned to live in balance with the Hulk (at least someone has spent years usefully), but he feels this paternal fatigue, resembles a grandfather who will not offend anyone. Captain America seeks forgiveness in some meetings that are held for those who need support after the loss of relatives, Hawkeye, and became a vigilante at all, having lost his family. All the scenes are atmospheric, echoing with humor, so that the viewer does not fall into depression.Then there is a glimmer of light in the face of the Ant, which gives new hope. And the wheel of fortune is spinning with renewed vigor to put a fat end to this seemingly endless story once and for all. Thanos in this story turns from a strategist and a prudent titan with his own motivation into an arrogant one who wants to kill everyone and everyone. And this, in my opinion, is a strong blunder of the film. The villain has become cardboard and uninteresting.The film has a lot of interesting moves related to travel, alternative realities, infinity stones. The main characters meet their past, literally face it face to face, getting the opportunity to rethink something, get a parting word from a loved one, say important words that could not be said in a previous life.A great move is showing some scenes from a different point of view. It was still smartly done in the sequel ""Back to the Future"", and here it was successfully repeated. It is always interesting to observe what happened in those moments that were, but remained behind the scenes in past films.The graphics and music are on top, the script has a lot of oddities and even holes that the authors are trying to explain, but after viewing there are still questions. There are a lot of heroes in the picture. I was pleased with the final epic scene, but, in my opinion, it still loses the battles in the ""Infinity War"".The meeting with those who have fallen is a bit messy. It is understandable. It was impossible to show the return of so many heroes and their meeting with others. It would make a melodrama out of the movie. They showed all the most important things, what the viewer was waiting for.The result for me was a great movie that I expected to see. I got what I wanted, what I expected. There is sadness, disappointment from what happened. It was known, predictable, but it's still impossible to prepare for this. The Avengers finale puts a bold dot for viewers in the stories of many characters. There are some unexpected twists here that you don't want to believe in, you have to part with those you don't want to, but that's life. There are no happy endings.9 out of 10.",positive
Best film in the mic I've ever seen brings back so much nologstia. The final battle scenes were well done. The death scenes were sad especially tony and Natasha. I wish Natasha had a nice funeral like tony because she was there from the very beginning. Overall nice movie,positive

Good movie wraps it all together. Ending was kinda dumb.,positive
Truly fascinating. A fitting conclusion that lives up to the hype.,positive
"Had good action scenes, but ultimately fell short of ending the legendary infinity saga. Black widow had the emotional sacrifice only to be overshadowed by iron man. The logic of the time travel doesn't make any sense with 2 captain america existing in the same timelines. Ok movie but just was majorly dissappinting.",positive
"Don't waste your money. Watch it at home. It's the worst avengers movie there is. Even ""the week of Ultron"" was better than this. A 12 year old could've written a better ending. Forced everything. 1st half is too slow and the 2nd half is too disappointing. I am not going to the cinema to watch ""Avengers"" for a reality check and get a headache. I am going there to get entertained. This wasn't even least entertaining. This was bloody depressing.",negative
"I really liked the movie! Interesting , fascinating , flies by very quickly ! I love the Marvel line , each film as a separate art form ! I advise you!",positive
"I just returned from the movie and I loved this film so much! There was only one disappointment, but it was only because of the love I have for the character and I know the Russo bros did what they had to do. I would I have been bummed no matter who it was. I have been a huge fan since the first Ironman and have loved each Marvel film, but this one takes the cake. Action packed, hilarious lines (Thor cracks me up!), great surprises, and emotional tears at your heartstrings that makes you love each character more when you thought it just couldn't be possible. It was 3 hours long, but went by so fast you didn't even think about the fact that you had to pee. I don't think anyone in the theater got up! Great, great movie- go see it- I will be going again for sure! 😍",positive
"I'm not interested in reading Marvel comics at all. There are some like Deadpool and Spider-Man which I love to take a look occasionally, and I have every single Black Panther comic on my Comixology (although I have only read one of them), but other than that I have absolutely no attachment to any other Marvel superhero. And yet when I watched Avengers: Endgame, I could actually feel like this is something of my dream coming true. This is something I really needed and because of this I can say I have really seen histroy getting created in comic book movies.The CGI of this movie is absolutely intense. Every nerd's dream is to see a cast assembly of their favourite franchise characters on the big screen played by actors in live action, filled with CGI. And this movie absolutely does it. This happening in the first two Avengers movies or Josstice League didn't feel too intense since there weren't many characters, but over here there are tons of them. And that made it look really badass.We also get to revisit all the old MCU movies and have the nostalgia of those scenes. There is an emotional scene of Tony meeting his father, but most of them are funny like Hulk smashing the cars and Starlord singing Come Get Your Love from the opening scene of Guardians of the Galaxy. The fight scene between the two Captain Americas and Nebulas was decent, but the fact that they actually chose to add them when they could have gotten away really seems nice.And then finally we have what we waited for in the last 3 hours. Iron Man, Captain America and Thor come together to fight Thanos. Thor looks so cool when he has lightning in his eyes. The fight scene of all three of them together against Thanos looked so well choreographed without any jump cuts, it didn't even feel like an MCU movie. And finally when all the portals open, Captain America finally says the fabled ""Avengers Assemble"" that we all had been waiting for to hear in the last 7 years.Though there are many things about this movie that I didn't like at all. First of all, Black Widow's death. I really hate Black Widow. She seems to have some sort of a plot armour around her. Throughout the entire MCU I never saw her getting beaten even once. And she fights every cool looking bad guy with 1000 jump cuts. I had heard about her death being in this movie, so I was really excited to see her finally get whooped. But even then she died BY BEATING Hawkeye. She doesn't even have the decency to take a beating. Sorry Black Widow, I think I'm never gonna like you.My next problem comes with Ant-Man's return. A mouse? Seriously? I get MCU is supposed to be a family movie franchise but this went a little too far. It could have been something better, like Scott finding something inside the quantum field that allows him to control space and time which could later be used to gather the Infinity Stones. Then I also have a problem with the Thanos army attacking the Avengers HQ. They have such heavy weapons, and they can't even make past a force field before Hulk uses the Infinity Gauntlet? And finally my problem comes with that all-female scene. It was so cringy! I don't know much if people probably like such scenes, but why was it needed at all? It's not like anyone was looking forward to it. With all that said, I have no other problem with this movie.In my opinion Avengers: Endgame should have been the last movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Making more movies completely undermines the point of this movie. It is supposed to be a culmination of everything that has ever happened throughout the franchise. Now making more movies at this point is just blatant cash grabbing. I really hope that Disney decides to start Phase 4 from scratch, since it's becoming hard to keep track of all the MCU movies at this point.",positive
"The only problem with the movie is that it's too damn good. It'll take a long time to get over the awesomeness of endgame. Just sit back, relax and enjoy a masterpiece by Russo Bros :)",positive
I went to see a Marvel film and i end up seeing a Back to the Future film.7/10. Infinity wars was much more better,positive
"I watched Endgame in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!It may have taken 11 years, 21 films but Endgame finally has shown redemption and smart direction from Joe Russo and Anthony RussoI want more!",positive
"Some great moments but so many disappointing ones in the midst of it all:1. Thor from the Thor movies and the avengers ones previously to this Thor was easily the most annoying aspect.2. HULK... any need for him when he doesn't smash or add to action scenes?? He's a wasted character for several movies now so not quite as disappointing as Thor but you might as well just have Bruce Banner character only without any ""green""-ness as far as I'm concerned.3. Euphoria of some of the scenes dwindling away with the following scene but unnecessarily dragged out was criminal. Infinity war in comparison I walked out of the cinema completely blown away and giddy but it just wasn't like that in endgame.4. Plot holes (unless I misunderstood the whole time travelling issue), how was the future nebula able to kill the past nebula with no repercussions? The vormir thing with Hawkeye and black widow wanting to sacrifice themselves for the other. How would there that much love between them to warrant the release of the soul stone to the other?5. Thanos: Almost as disappointing as Thor. The Thor and Thanos from Infinity War were like Ali v Frazier/Foreman. In this they became Audley Harrison v David Price for no reason whatsoever.There were probably more things but this failed to deliver following infinity war. At the same time there were some parts I was thrilled with i.e. the return of the avengers during the battle scene (although another thing that annoyed me was it felt like there was only 10 minutes of action in the three hours and after the action in infinity war it was annoying).Come at me if you want but you know I am right :D",positive

"This one star review is necessary to bring you sheep back to reality. This movie was a boring mess and a major letdown. Infinity War was far better, and that isn't saying much. All of these Marvel films except for a handful out of the 22, 23, however too many have been made-have the same feel by the time credits roll. The MCU's true legacy is showing how if a studio can keep audiences laughing, they'll shut their brains off and ignore the inanity (inanity not insanity, clarification for the lemmings) in front of them.",negative
One of the greatest movie of this century. 11 years worth treasure.,positive
"Framed in emotions, a farewell to all core charecters.
The film strikes through every expectation in terms of storyline, action, visuals and humor.

"Eleven years later, global fans finally waited for the final chapter of the ""Infinite Legend"" of Marvel Universe, moved, recalled, humorous, unwilling to show all of them in front of the audience through this movie at a time. This is not only the end of this stage, but more like a beautiful knot to connect all the previous movies one by one. Therefore, when we re-examine the past clips and scenes, we will not only sigh how the legend became a classic, but also lament the time. In an instant, 11 years have passed, the beauty is late, and the hero retires. The soundtrack of this ending piece gave me a deep feeling, just as the story slowly expressed the emotion he told. At the same time, the director also spent a certain amount of space to describe the deeper emotional description of the first generation of six veterans, so that in the end, as long as you are a person who grew up with the MCU, you will be moved. At that moment when all heroes appeared on the trumpet of the final battle, everyone would witness this immortal legend. In the end, I personally feel that the director should focus on portraying the scenes of the final battle. After all, this is the ultimate battle. More should show the cooperation between the heroes, all the previous discord and differences will be turned into nothing, and the enemy will go forward bravely. Also, if you can do a better rhythm in the rhythm of the literary and martial arts, the whole movie will have a lot of appreciation. As for the BUG on the time and space most discussed in this film, I remember that Mr. Hawking also said before that as long as time is involved, there will always be many relative paradoxes. Since human beings can't explain this problem now, we don't need to find out, sit down and enjoy the movie. Sincerely, a legend of ten years has come to an end!",positive
I want to commend Hawkeye and Black Widow's friendship. It's not a battle for who will live but a battle for who will die.,positive
"What Endgame needed to be, was a movie that illustrated the love its makers had for not only the the movie itself, but far more importantly, for an entire decades' worth of journey. For the MCU to thrive for over a decade, was us, its fans, showing our commitment to this creation; what Avengers: Endgame needed to be, was the MCU's creator's turn, to demonstrate their commitment to us. What Avengers: Endgame needed to be, was a Love Letter 3000, to a fan base that followed it to the end of Time and Space, with our Minds and Souls, that allowed it the Power to touch our Reality.That, truthfully, is a gargantuan task, so huge in fact, that if this film was a complete disaster, you would almost understand the inevitability of such an outcome. So with that said, did Feige, The Russo Brothers, and the MCU give us a Love Letter 3000?The topic of time travel has always been a tall order, especially if your intention is to respect the science, while delivering an entertaining product. Endgame, did exactly that; though not perfectly, it did it with some level of perfection.Trying to fit in story, reunions, suffering, action and sadly, goodbyes, was again always going to be a tough ask. Endgame at points felt rushed, but not because they were rushed scenes, but rather because, as a fan, personally, I wanted to linger that little bit longer in the moment, and I imagine most fans felt the same. However, rushed or not, the nods, connections and continuity that was displayed in this film, to accomplish everything from story to goodbyes, was handled with such care that, you can linger in that intention of attention.So, with amazing attention to detail, a difficult story that was dealt with, professionally and passionately though not perfectly, a cast that can never really ever be forgotten, in a film that quite honestly, didn't feel like a film, but more like genuine adieu with a heavy heart, Avengers: Endgame leaves you asking for nothing more, except maybe: ""Do you really have to end?""Thank you Marvel Studios, for your Love Letter 3000.",positive

"Infinity War is a Masterpiece and there is no comparison between IW and Endgame more like EndLame.
This movie is full of plotholes , poorly written dramatic scenes and not so funny funny scenes.
Why does Ironman has to die , why he had to wear the gauntlet to snap Thanos when they were going to beat Thanos anyway. Fat thor, useless Hulk, ant-man , captain marvel, hawkeye, captain America , black panther, doctor strange, spiderman , Ironman etc all were there. There was no need of that end snap. I know they wanted to give Iron man a farewell but in a satisfying way, in movie it felt like it was totally useless. And what about Hulk and thanos encounter , oh yeah there wasn't one. I was waiting for proffessor Hulk to step up to Thanos , another disappointment.
Many people liked the last interaction between Hawkeye and Black widow but personally found it cringy and over dramatic with lame writing.
In IW you can clearly see every character was given their share of screen time and justified roles but Endgame was mess .
I have watched IW in theatres 4 times plus many times at home and i would still watch it and enjoy but Endgame i can't.
Many stupid fanboys and casual watchers might find this movie good but the people who likes things making sense and a story which takes you deep into it would feel how unsatisfying this movie is .
Even casting Brie Larson as captian marvel wasn't that bad as this movie .Last words : Infinity War wasn't the movie we deserved but It was the movie we needed.
And this movie (Endgame) is not even close to what it should be.",negative

It was inevitable that Infinity War set up too big a plotline for it to not be somewhat disappointing in the conclusion. Very sentimental (too sentimental?). These will not be popular opinions. Oh well.,positive
"I know many DC deek riders will disagree but Endgame is definitely much better than Nolan Trash knight and any other superhero movies. Direction was perfect, A Perfect end, 11 years journey was ended in just 3 hours, Ending 8 minutes was totally unexpected. Every superhero fan should watch this movie actually it's not a superhero movie it will give you some Life lesson. Genius will get this👍",positive

"So, I have been going to all the Marvel movies since I was 8 years old when the first Iron Man came out. Since then it's been a part of my life that when Marvel would drop a new movie I'd be going whether that meant going with my brother or with friends. I always really took those movies and it's characters for granted. And I have to say, I couldn't ask for them to wrap up the Avengers saga in a better more emotional or entertaining way. I have never cried in a Marvel movie before, but this movie shed tears at least twice for me. For me this was a combination of the film's excellence and the sadness I faced seeing such a big part of my childhood come to a wrap. If you grew up with the Avengers like I did I have a feeling you'll feel the same, and even if you're not a hardcore fan, it makes a really fun and thrilling watch even with its 3 hour runtime.",positive
"Honestly, I like this movie at first-half. But at the middle, I got bored and I play my phone at cinemas (I sit at the top, and my phone brightness is very low, so I'll not disturbing everyone watching it). When it start to the climax of the story, I got hyped and wow, I REALLY LOVE all the superheroes coming and fights the purple guy (I know its Thanos).
But, I'm sure, the ending is perfect to end the Avenger series. Recommend 10/10. But storyline 9/10.",positive
"As the culmination of 21 movies, ""Avengers: Endgame"" bears a hefty investment from audiences. To merely call this an ""event movie"" would be to overlook how much the Marvel Cinematic Universe has ingratiated itself into mass culture over the last 11 years. For better or worse, the filmmakers understand this. One consequence I'm not especially fond of is that much time is spent on send-offs for the retired superheroes. I don't even too much mind the bloated some-three-hours runtime, nor that I listened to a cinema full of sniffling during the movie's sappier moments, but I do think it detracts from any semblance of a self-contained artistic or narrative work that could stand on its own. And, sure, I enjoyed some of the comic relief injected to lighten that mood--even if there were a few too many jokes at the expense of Professor Hulk, or Ant-Man's stupidity, or Thor's newfound obesity (c'mon, ""Cheez Wiz"" running through his veins--really?). On the other hand, I am fond of the self-reflexive use of time travel, to, in effect, return to some of the cinematic highlights of prior entries in the MCU. Because that's what ""Endgame"" is about: it's a movie founded upon a past of 21 other movies.The scenes with Captain America interacting with his past in the 2012 ""The Avengers,"" including a nifty reference to a scene from ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" (2014) and of Thor reliving his memories of ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013) are especially rewarding. It's a heritage we share with the movie and with the characters. Despite all of the humorous talk concerning the illogic of space-time-continuum fare such as the ""Back to the Future"" series, ""Endgame,"" in one respect at least, follows the time-travel rules of ""Back to the Future Part II"" (1989). Both movies exploit time travel to relive highlights from and the success of prior movies--whether it's Marty McFly watching himself inventing rock-n-roll on stage from the first ""Back to the Future"" (1985) film or Cap fighting his younger and more naive self from the first Avengers assemblage.I enjoyed this part enough, upon initial viewing at least, for it to largely compensate for the faults in other parts. That the final battle almost seems anti-climactic, dark and, naturally, cluttered. Or that while several of the characters have well-defined arcs, others do not, despite having also survived the dust turning in ""Infinity War"" (2018). Bruce Banner's lack of development seems especially egregious, as he continues to serve as comedic relief, as well as for spouting science-y exposition, in his last two appearances, which stands as a disappointing departure from the centrality of this character from ""Age of Ultron"" (2015) to ""Ragnarok"" (2017). Likewise, Thanos, after dominating ""Infinity War,"" is reduced back to a run-of-the-mill underdeveloped villain. More minor characters also seem short-changed, including Okoye, the raccoon and Rhodey. Even some of the previously-deceased, like Gamora, are better rounded-out in a shorter amount of time. Perhaps, worst of all is the use of Captain Marvel here as a deus-ex-machina Superman--conveniently flying in at the last moment to save a plot in need. Moreover, the scene where all of the female superheros happen to be in the same spot is such a eye-rolling and self-defeating piece of self-congratulating political correctness or pandering (besides, as if Danvers needs help getting through a battle zone--she just blew up a spaceship by flying through it, for crying out loud). A similar scene, if on a smaller scale, worked more organically in ""Infinity War.""But, I like the quieter moments, especially early on, which are something of a relieving contrast to the relentless momentum of ""Infinity War."" Perhaps, it's the appropriate send-off, too, for the characters who are well-developed here, including (""fridging"" aside) Black Widow, Cap and Iron Man. The benefit of such fine acting talent, after all, isn't for their fighting skills; it's commendable that ""Endgame"" allows their characters some time to breath and reflect before moving on or saying goodbye.",positive
"Before the covid-19 pandemic, i watched avengers endgame in brazilian theaters. i literally got surprised when i realized it was 3 HOURS!!!! I recommend you to watch (but try not to sleep due to the 3 hours).",positive
Where to start ... A rat that bring back Antman by walking onto a keyboard? Fat Thor that bring back his hammer from the past without any repercussions on the past itself? Captain Marvel didn't bring much value to the story ? Time traveling that doesn't make any sense ? If Thanos knew he won then all he had to do is keep the stone instead of destroying them at the end ? And again the time traveling thing is too easy ?? They could lose as much as they want and just go back in time ... such lazy writing... and you can bring back some people with the 5 stones but not some ? Are the people store in a box to be brought back ? They could have just fighted a decent Thanos after inifinity war and build the story around this instead of building it around the time traveling...,positive
"This was a fun movie, but it was by means no where near a 10/10. Infinity War was a much better movie to be honest. It had way better action and a better story. End Game's plot was a mess. Overall, it was an entertaining and fitting end to an era, but was by no means perfect.",negative
"Does it entertain from beginning to end? Yes. Does it makes you laugh as much as it makes you cry? Yes. Is the acting top notch? Yes. Are the special effects, score and set-pieces the absolute best modern cinema has to offer? Yes. Is the script an absolute masterpiece that makes justice to every character in it? Yes. Is it the best movie ever made? Yes.",positive
"Infinity War was more about how Thanos manages to get all the stones. So it was obvious to have more action in Infinity War. EndGame deals with how People got affected after the decimation by Thanos. So the emotional part was necessary to give a good build-up.
What action do you expect from this movie all-the time? The Avengers simply didn't know how to undo the snap until Ant-Man came in. Once they knew about Time Travel, they started working on it.What was boring about this?
The ones who are confused with Time-Travel, Lemme explain in simple words --- ""When you go in the past you simply create a different timeline which will end up having a future different from the timeline you came from.""
The last fight battle was made for us and still y'all seem to be disappointed.
What's ridiculous as how you expect this movie to have as much action as Infinity War. This movie was more about how to undo the snap while IW was about how to prevent the snap.
Definitely, EndGame had to have a plot which dealt with ""ideas"" more than ""Action"".
HOW MANY TIMES YOU WILL EXPECT AVENGERS TO BE FIGHTING THANOS?
Watch the movie with some concentration jeez.",positive
"I know the hype around this movie, so I'm not going to give any plot points away. I will say, however, that it really is emotional, exciting, and awe-inspiring. I went in knowing very little (that's the way to go, by the way) and it really paid off, as a lot of the plot decisions were surprising and bold.It has its problems, and without giving away too much, I thought that some feminist themes that were far too overt and frustrating were desperately forced in there. But in all, it's hard to complain about Endgame, because it really is one of the craziest things Hollywood has ever achieved.",positive
"How con you not love this movie, specially if you have been following the franchise since its beginning. The movie has a really strong beginning, making you feel a little depressed and sad. Buuuut, if the movie has a problem, is the middle part; after rewatching it over and over, you just want the time travel stuff to end; yes its a nice callback to a lot of previous marvel movies and moments but given that at that moment there is no villain or an urgency, it feels kinda boring. And the way the plan goes wrong is a little stupid as well. But of course, everybody knows that the movie shines in the third act, just when theyve brought everyone alive. The final fight still gives you chills even if youve seen it a thousand times, when all the heroes appear, youre excitement goes from 100 to 100,000 it is truly a once in a lifetime experience, just as its predecessor. It is very satisfactory seeing how this story that has been 11 years in the making end.It is definitely not as good as Infinity War, but the experience you get from watching it is really touching and exciting, something you can only feel after watching all the previous movies. Another one in a lifetime experience.",positive
What a great movie!! You know nothing until the end! Such a masterpiece!!,positive
"One of the best movies I've seen in a while! I loved every single piece of this movie and I would highly recommend seeing it! Following on from Infinity War, Endgame carry's on nicely from Infinity War which is an amazing addition. Having be the last Avengers movie in the saga this movie finishes off well and leaves the cherry on top for the saga. Visuals where on point as well as cast and sfx. This movie in my opinion is definitely a movie I would watch again from beginning to end. Absolutely amazing!",positive
"I won't include any spoliers in this review.The movie is good and worth the six bucks I paid to see it. To be honest, there were a ton of super heroes in it that I could not even identify. And I'm pretty sure a couple of actors who come up in the end credits weren't even this movie at all!For the most part, the movie keeps your attention with pretty much non-stop action and a decent storyline that follows up on the half-end of Earth ending from the last installment. It's a BIG movie with huge special effects and I imagine the entire roster of Marvel characters.For me, the Black Panter group appearance was rather unintentionally laughable. I think it's the wakest of all Marvel super heros. And that brings up another point -- when all the super heroes work together you realize how dumb some of their super powers are.There were not as many off hand comic remarks as seen in previous Marvel movies and I think that was to the detrement of the film. The new Thor is pretty funny, however.As you might expect, the finale is a really big one and all the big guns are brought out for the ending. And when it's all done, you have to sit through a rather unnecessessary 30 minute coda. It reminded me of the third Lord of the Rings installment that just kept ending as well.So the net net is, the movie is good, not great and a half hour can easily have been cut without a problem.",positive
"First off, I'm going to try and keep this as spoiler free as possible. I may talk about some aspects but I'll try and keep the *BIG* things a surprise. Ok...now that's out of the way...This is not a film for the casual viewer. And I know that may seem like a dumb statement to make about the 4th Avengers film in a hugely successful franchise (you'd think everyone has seen everything) but obviously there are some people out there who might just go to the big team up movies or maybe just go to their favourite character's movie or...might be dragged along by a friend who's the fan. This movie is not a stand-alone. It's such a love letter to the MCU in general. There's so many different easter eggs and nods to previous films that you'd greatly benefit if you've been a fan since day 1. Tying to that, this film did a good job of sending off and tying up certain character's storylines. It made me very emotional. Prepare to cry buckets. The film also has a theme around ""family"" which I thought I was nice too. there's so many great moments and quips that i'd love to talk about more. But as a Cap stan I can say I fully feel satisfied with his scenes. Although, I felt satisified with mostly everyone in this movie. The only characters that I felt got a bit of the shaft were Captain Marvel, Valkryie and Okoye. They werent in it as much as I was expecting...but again I understand that this movie was really supposed to be a swan song for the Avengers and therefore they wanted to focus more on them.So, there wasnt much I didnt like in this film. It did leave with some questions around the logisitics of how things worked. There was also one really eye-rolling scene where they say ""She's not alone"" and every female walks onto screen. I get it...""girl power"" yay...but it felt really forced.All in all though i thought this movie was just such a great end to 11 years in the making. If you're a fan you wont be disappointed.",positive
"The long-awaited conclusion to the Marvel's Avengers film franchise puts everything in perspective from the previous installments. If you are a diehard MCU devotee, this film will likely be your must-see of the year. For the disengaged or the downright uninitiated, this is actually not bad.Although clearly aiming for the franchise to hit the highest of highs in terms of catharsis, the film's emotional impact is diluted by its sheer size. The many, many different characters are utterly dwarfed by the film's enormous scope. The good news is, the story is a straightforward battle of good and evil with very little in the way of divided loyalties or moral quandaries. But there are so many players and so many backstories to tie together, that you could be forgiven for feeling more relief than a visceral thrill when it's all said and done.On the plus side, there is a stirring musical score and a heartfelt ending that will put all doubts about the film's soulfulness to rest. Although the Avengers franchise in its totality isn't quite my cup of tea, I recommend this as solid, quality entertainment.",positive
"This movie is a steaming pile of overrated feces.Bad ending , badly written lines.The best thing about this movie is that it kills of that annoying Black Widow.",negative
"To do what marvel has done over the course of 22 films is near impossible and to end that in an epic film?! Wow, that needs appreciation.To the people saying that the time travel is an insult to real time travel movies, come-on listen to yourself, no one has done time travel so no one knows how it will effect, wake up from your hate world and see it for what it is. I get what you are doing, seeing a film so highly rated because you don't rate it that high so you want to lower the overall rating, thus the 1 stars. Well good luck to you all.",positive
"Now here we are at the Endgame. Iron Man said it in Age of Ultron. Dr. Strange in Infinity War. Currently it's the second highest-grossing film of all time, relegating Titanic to third place, and is only $400M away from overtaking Avatar. And it deserves to be right up there, because all three prompted the world to get off of their records and go to the cinema to be a part of a mini cultural movement. I remember when the first Avengers movie was announced, I counted down the days until it was finally shown. Going back further, I remember when I was kid my mom would buy me comic books, most of which were X-men titles but an Avenger one would slip through once in a while. So I really don't like Iron Man because he's too steely, Cap was boring, Black Widow was here then gone, Hawkeye was too arrogant, Hulk was just green and Thor piqued my interest. But when I got a copy of Avengers West Coast, Scarlet Witch mesmerized me and Vision (all white version) got me sold. I mean a witch in love with a robot in the 90s? As an introvert teen trying to find his way in life, these are the people that accompanied me in the tiny corners of a place I'd run and hide to.It's one thing to read about them, it's another to see them alive and moving on the big screen. Or half of them alive anyway. Endgame continues on after the snap, with those left behind trying to continue on after the loss they suffered. If there's one thing negative I can say about the movie, is that the first hour showing the impact of the loss didn't resonate with me. Maybe because I knew beforehand those gone will be brought back and I just have to go through the motions to get to it. Maybe my opinion will change as I watch it again in the future.Now on to the good parts:Final warning, detailed spoilers ahead...1) Captain America wielding Mjolnir (collective gasp from the audience)
2) That shot when Thanos's army was approaching and only Captain America was left standing with a broken shield
3) ""On your left...""
4) Pepper Potts as Rescue
5) Avengers!....Assemble.
6) Ant man punching an alien ship
7) Spider-man and Iron Man hug. Remember in Homecoming Peter thought they were going to hug and Tony said we're not there yet? They're there now.
8) Passing of the gauntlet from Hawkeye to Captain Marvel
9) Scarlet Witch. The only other Avenger who could've killed Thanos if he didn't get help.
10) Captain Marvel's entry...and short hair...and destroying Thanos's warship single handedly.
11) All female Avengers rescuing Peter. People are divided about this, some saying it felt forced, that it was a little hypocritical but me, I'm here for it.
12) Captain Marvel's one on one with Thanos, that head but and Thanos needing an Infinity Stone to fend her off.
13) Steve coming back to pass on the shield to Sam.What comes next though? How do they top something as big as this? Well there are so many other story lines in the comic book they can translate into the big screen. The actors? Tom, Chad, Benedict and Brie are more than capable of soldiering on. There's also the TV series set for Loki, Bucky and Sam, and Scarlet Witch and Vision. Let's also not forget that Disney now hold the rights to X-Men. So my prediction of still talking about the MCU well way into my 50s is starting to become possible. We might've gotten Endgame, but it seems the game has just begun.",positive
"First of all let me say that I was looking forward eagerly to this movie along with millions of others, I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and there's no doubt you get your money's worth. For the broader fantasy/adventure genre that superhero films fit into, my high-water mark is set by the Lord of the Rings trilogy. On a scale where LOTR is 10/10, I give Wonder Woman a 9, and both Avengers Endgame and Infinity War an 8. In other words, it's darn good, and it has the high satisfaction level that the Russo brothers promised us we'd get. The production values are state of the art, and the payoff is to see *almost* every MCU character present and accounted for so that we can see them in action once more.I was surprised -- if you'll forgive the circular statement here -- by just how many surprises there were for both the plot elements and the characters themselves. It's now clear why the producers and directors kept such tight wraps on this thing before its release. Broadly speaking I was expecting that this would play out in much the same style as Infinity War, like they were the first and second halves of a 5.5-hour epic. I was wrong. It's epic all right, but stylistically, Endgame is its own film. The biggest thing I didn't see coming is that lots of the first half particularly is reflective, deliberately paced, and NOT just slam-bang CGI. As far as I'm concerned that was welcome -- the cast is populated by characters we've learned to care about so give them space to breath. It's the end of an era and it's all given a proper sendoff. At the same time, there are plenty of big, dramatic entrances that led to cheers and applause for the audience I was in. Those are glorious, and the final big action scene is over-the-top huge. The flip side, though, is that there are SO many characters in play that most of them get only a bit of screen time, not much more than cameos.One thing that was not a surprise was that most of the Endgame storyline followed the Original Six Avengers -- Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, Hawkeye for one final go-round. Mostly, it's the Three Amigos that head the list. And by the end I felt like those characters have all had lots of innings by now, it's past time to move on with all the other characters we've met and who could be just as engaging. The main ""other"" leads here with bigger-than-cameo roles were Ant-Man, Rhodey, and Captain Marvel, all welcome.I think the whole 22-movie arc of the MCU, and in particular Infinity War and Endgame, might qualify for being the movie event of a generation -- i.e. something so big and involving that everyone knows about it. A generation ago, it was the Lord of the Rings trilogy. A generation before that, it was 2001: A Space Odyssey and also Star Wars, two films that laid out diametrically opposite paths for the space/sci-fi genre and have both had their successors. And a generation before that? According to my parents it was Gone With The Wind, the making of which was nothing less than a national experience on a level bigger even than we're seeing now. (Just for fun, look up how movies rank in the all-time box office list after adjustment for inflation. Avengers Endgame has a ways to go yet.)About that 3-hour runtime. Too short for the material! Add another half-hour, put in an intermission, and then we'd have a true epic movie. Way back when, that's what big-budget epics were like -- things like Ben-Hur, Spartacus, How The West Was Won, El Cid, Cleopatra. They were great! Not just movies, but whole experiences. The intermission gave the audience a chance to do a washroom break, maybe get some more popcorn, clear their heads, then settle back in again. Endgame is *almost* there.Some other thoughts:Yes the big battlefield scene(s) toward the end make up a great orgy for the fans, but so much of it makes no sense. Various of the most powerful Avengers go one-on-one against Thanos and then get interrupted. Where's Iron Man when Carol is fighting him? Where's Wanda when Thor is going at him? They're supposed to be working together. This was too obviously just a way of giving everyone their chance at a big scene. This feels like lazy storytelling.Yes! Captain Marvel is right in there and boy is she powerful, but her presence felt just a bit tacked-on -- more like a guest star. I know this was supposed to be all about the ""core"" Avengers, and it is, but I wish they'd worked harder to bring her right in to the center of the story. (Great CGI too that no other MCU character has.)But this movie underscores yet again that the MCU still has a gender problem. Nebula is underused (again). Wanda is underused (again). Mantis is underused (again). Carol is uber-powerful but underused. Black Widow has been treated horribly inconsistently all the way along in the MCU films, and the way she's portrayed here is yet another example. She deserved better.I didn't much like the way Thor was used here either. They've pushed him so far into comedy mode that he's become a clown. Bad choice! Chris Hemsworth does light comedy well, but he's equally good as the serious God of Thunder and I wanted more of that side. The first Thor movie is one of the half-dozen best superhero films ever made, Ragnarok was also great, but here the character has become almost unrecognizable. What a letdown.And speaking of Asgard, a shout-out to Rene Russo, who's marvellous. She absolutely kills the scene(s) that she is in. We sure could have used more of her.There's a totally fun bit on the big battlefield where all the *female* superheros gather to form a united front. More please! This had better not be just tokenism. For example, Wanda (Scarlet Witch) is shown once again to be one of the very few heroes who was able to genuinely hurt Thanos. GIVE THIS WOMAN A MOVIE!! It doesn't hurt that Elizabeth Olsen is a first-rate actor.There's so much material that it's just an embarrassment of riches. By trying not to leave anyone out in this Grand Finale, the Russos have shortchanged various scenes that could have been better. And there are loads of deserving characters, like Valkyrie, Black Panther, Shuri, Wasp, Dr. Strange, Wong ... Too much in the last hour felt rushed.And about time travel. I'm not particularly giving anything away to say that it's there just like everyone expected. But just like all other time travel plots, (a) it's fun but (b) this version of it doesn't make any more sense than any other movies built on the device. Bizarre logic, plot holes, missing pieces; it seems fine as it's happening, but you're left scratching your head after the credits roll.",positive
"It's amazing how I do not feel sad that this franchise finally came to an end, I guess I am satisfied with the way it ended, maybe it was the only right way..I was surprised that not many characters actually died in the movie, apart from Black Widow and Iron Man, Gamora is alive and well, that was confirmed by the directors and Loki obviously is going to alternate his future with him running with the tesseract. Captain America had the best possible ending, altho I expected that Barnes will be the next Captain America, since he is also a super soldier, but later on I found out that Sam was the one in the comics also, so no hard feelings. The first half an hour were average to say at least, but you can't expect action all the time in a 3 hour movie. The ending battle was breathtaking and it was worth it all the wait. Pepper's costume made by Stark was out of this world, I would really wish a stand alone film featuring Pepper continuing the legacy of our beloved Iron Man.",positive
"One of the best told superheroes stories and ends well with a bang. However, we are pleasantly surprised with all the twists and turns during the movie.Retaliation ? Unexpected heros helps our heroes first...Redemption ? Well, if we can turn back time in the past events...Sacrifice ? Yes, there is...But see the movie. Don't spoil the ENDGAME !",positive
"There is only one word to describe this film, a Masterpiece! This movie is the best movie I have ever seen! The fact the Russo Brothers made it 3 hours long was a great idea, I never felt bored nor disappointed during the 3 hours of the film. The movie's ending (in my opinion) is the best moment in cinematic history!",positive
"Well, they definitely threw everything into this movie including the kitchen sink. And they worked hard to give all of the characters sufficient screen time. I definitely feel as though I got my money's worth. There wasn't a boring moment in the movie and it didn't feel like a 3 hour movie. There's lots of action and lots of laughs. However, less would have been more. Or maybe it's that I am not used to seeing a movie in a crowded theater.",positive
"Anthony and Joe Russo have yet again pulled it off in what stands as one of the best films we've seen through the franchise.The story takes its time showing the aftermath of ""Avengers: Infinity War"", and what a take-off. The directors cleverly spends time developing the humanities of the superheroes, conveyed through the devastating effects of the acts of Thanos.Then the MCU universe creators delve into the usual smooth direction and execution, from a script filled with wit, MCU-law and humour into a grand conclusion to the 22 films that have kept me watching with excitement, and I have deeply enjoyed the franchise.There are two major weaknesses in my opinion:
(1) in ""Infinity War"", Thanos was idealistic, ambiguous, believable and complex in his philosophy, whereas in ""Endgame"", he was portrayed as more of a generic, sadistic maniac.(2) the time-travel setup did not work convincingly for me, as being illogical with respect to past defining events in the franchise.But still, I think an excellent conclusion to the MCU.",positive
"Pretty much 90% of the user reviews already say what I want to say so I'll keep it short. This movie was so much worse, in every way, than Infinity War. Which is a shame and it's not gonna get a low score because of how overrated it is, even though most people leave reviews saying how much they hated it. It just sucks that THIS is the ending to the decade long series we all grew up with.",positive
"I love science fiction and fantasy, and I have no problem suspending disbelief for purposes of enjoying a good comic book movie, but Endgame just didn't work for me on a couple levels. First, they kill Thanos with little fanfare or drama at what is basically the start of the show. This gets to the whole drama thing, it is all based essentially on a do over, but they try to make it dramatic because they just have ""one chance to get it right"" yet Cap and Tony screw up and just get a do over. So they are fighting to save the world (or half of it anyway) very dramatic, but if this doesn't work they will just do it over, not very dramatic, they beat Thanos at the beginning, again not very dramatic to fight him again.Then there is the time travel logic they use to build up the story that doesn't really work either, you can't change the past, you can just create alternative timelines, but the whole stone thing somehow sidesteps this critical rule ""as long as they put them back in time. And speaking of putting them back, getting them was a major deal involving the whole squad and a lot of risk. How is returning them so much easier? Black Widow ""has to stay dead"" yet Gamora, who died under the exact same circumstances/edict comes back no problem. Fat Thor and smart Hulk didn't help matters. Missed Vision too, everybody else could come back, but not the Viz? Screw that, he is the most interesting character on the whole team.Sorry, don't get all the love, worst Avengers movie yet by far.",negative

Also... Captain Marvel comes across very arrogant and smug like 'yes we know... you are super powerful and you know it'. I know Iron Man is very arrogant as well but he makes it into a positive as its funny and likeable!Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and for all of you that haven't seen it yet... get the tissues ready!",positive

"I'll just say if you understand how time works then you can understand that this movie did not abide by its rules. Just cause antman says back to the future is a lie doesn't mean that all time rules go out the window. Gamora shouldn't be alive and they ruined cap by bringing him back as an old man sitting on a bench which would've worked if they bought him back as an old man thru the quantum realm while he was in the suit. Don't know for the life of me why he was old and on a bench. Wouldn't make any sense relative to time. I don't know maybe I'm nitpicking but they acted like black widow didn't make an ultimate sacrifice by dedicating the whole ending to Tony's death too. Was a decent movie but anyone who says it was great would be lying to themselves but hey that's just my opinion, enjoy it for what it is because it has major flaws with time.",positive
"After all the hype I was convinced it couldn't top the last one. I was wrong.
Aside from personally not liking the direction they went with one character, I have literally 0 complaints. It's wonderful. Go see it.",positive
"For 11 years marvel has been building up for their epic finale and it is almost safe to say they nailed it
With an emotional roller-coaster, breathtaking soundtracks and epic scenes and fight sequences that will be the standard against which all the upcoming movies of this genre is held, Marvel delivered the superhero movie of the decade
However, the plot felt a little forced as they were constantly trying to provide the perfect finale - which they almost did -, they filled the movie with plot drivers to reach the epic peak of Marvel cinematic universe
But all in all I can safely say that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen and it can probably withstand the test of time as people at different times can sit at the edges of their seats as they see the ""AVENGERS ASSEMBLE"".",positive
"I want to start out saying I love all the Marvel movies leading up to Endgame. I loved Infinity War because it seemed to be setting up a terrific conclusion to the original 6 Avengers story arc's. I was very wrong. Let's start with Tony's Arc. In Ironman 1 Tony is told you are a man who has everything and nothing. In Ironman 2 we find out his dad was distant and cold to him, and in ironman 3 he is getting panic attacks because he thinks it's up to him to save the world from all threats. So in Endgame he finally gets everything that's important. He becomes a Dad and husband and... was proven right by having to die saving the universe himself? Why? Because we are supposed to believe Tony can't retire? Of course he can. Didn't he say to Steve in AoU ""isn't that why we fight so we can end the fight? So we can go home?"" Tony wanted to retire. Tony's arc should have been about being a good dad like his father never was and finally becoming the man who has everything important. He should have learned that he doesn't have to do it all on his own. Team work should have won the final battle. What's the point of finally getting all the Avengers together if it's left to one man to sacrifice himself to save everyone? Tony's ending was not satisfying and it was not the end they have been building towards from the beginning. Now let's talk about the real tragedy in this movie. Steve Rogers character. We know he is a good man who always does what he believes is right. He calls Home the Avengers facility and says he can't ignore a situation that's headed south. He loved Peggy but found out she had gotten married and had a happy life and he tried moving on with her niece. This storyline was ignored which was ok because most of Steves storyline in the MCU has been about saving Bucky. You remember him right? Steve didn't seem to for the entire movie. Instead of thinking about Sam and Bucky and all the people they are going to save if their plan works when they find Thanos in the beginning of Endgame Steve's just looking at the Peggy compass that he hasn't looked at in at least 3 movies. Why? So we can all forget about his actual character development and think it's a great ending when he goes back in time to be with Peggy. I'm just going to ignore all the plot holes associated with Steve going back in time and just focus on the character assasination this commits. This means the same guy who says he can't ignore a situation headed south, who never ran away from a fight, who said I'm with you till the end of the line"" to Bucky is just going to live out his life in the past never saving his friend from being a brain washed assassin, never saving his other friends parents from being killed by his best friend, never stopping any of the thousands of bad things he would know are going to happen? That's not Steve. The writers never let Steve get a personal life. He never found someone after Peggy and he never had anything except the Avengers. He was the one that was set up to die. The final battle starts with what is probably the most epic scene in comic book movie history but fizzles our soon after. Doctor Stranges plan makes no sense. How was this the only way they could win? Why couldn't Captain Marvel snap? Why couldn't captain Marvel just fly the gauntlet to another galaxy? Why couldn't Doctor Strange open a portal and drop the gauntlet on some random planet? In Infinity War why didn't Doctor Strange use his portal to go to Wakanda and tell Thor to aim for the head. The characters powers were very inconsistent for the first time in the MCU. Why was Thanos with no infinity stones able to fight Mjolnir and Storm Breaker but Thanos with all 6 stones would have lost to Storm Breaker if Thor would have just aimed for the head? Why can Captain Marvel fly through a huge spaceship 10 times but she gets knocked out after one punch from Thanos? Why does no one attack Thanos at the same time as someone else? Where's the big team up? You would think getting everyone together for the first time would have been the only way to defeat Thanos, but you'd be wrong because it's all about Tony stark. Even Steve picking up Mjolnir means nothing really because it has no affect on the end of the battle. Thor and Steve could be taken out of this movie and nothing would change. They do nothing of importance. This movie seems so disconnected from Infinity War that it's boggles my mind how this movie has the same writers and directors as Infinity War and it was filmed at the same time as Infinity War. How can you get one so wrong and the other so right? It seems clear to me that the writers and directors decided that Tony was dying and Steve was going back to the past no matter how much their story suffered from doing it. It's like they had a check list of things to put in the movie without actually making a good story that fit in with the rest of their movies. This is by far the most dissapointing ending to anything I've ever looked forward to.",negative
"This movie had so much to tell in 3 hours!! It honestly could have been longer and I still would have watched it because ever bit of content was amazing!!!I don't want to spoil anything because Ik people will read this for spoilers, but I will say that everything that happened was what I wanted from this movie.Stories come to an end while others start. It was the perfect way to end with opening the door to so many possible things in this universe.I am excited to see what comes out of this because there are so many things that can build off of each other.This movie was perfect in every way. The Avengers grow into this family that so many of us have come to cherish.It might be the Endgame, but it is the end of the beginning.",positive
"Endgame is the best Avengers movie, hands down, and one of the best Marvel movies so far. Someone who has only watched one or two MCU movies before going to watch Endgame is basically going in blind. You won't find the symbolism of this movie unless you've watched all the previous movies, but especially the Captain America, Iron Man and Thor franchises. Things come full circle in the end and it's an emotional movie.Before watching Endgame, I read many opinions on it and I have to agree that the movie is not uniformly paced. Personally, I like it this way. Some things felt rushed, yes, but it leads to the overall tone of the film; desperation. Things get a little sloppy when you get desperate.Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth were amazing, as always, and provided memorable performances, with Tony Stark and Thor providing comic relief from time to time. I love that every Marvel movie finds a balance between humour and action and love. At the end of the day, Endgame's a very human movie that teaches us to do the right thing, even if it hurts us; to fight for the ones we love; and to live without regrets.",positive
"This is a special movie. Movies like this come out rarely and they aren't always good. The one before this was Logan, and even thought Endgame is on a much larger scale, the feelings, I left the theater with, were very similar.This is one of the boldest MCU movies, in terms of creative choices, and one of the darker ones, in terms of stakes. I really felt our heroes were in genuine danger throughout the movie. Endgame retains that lighthearted charm, that we've come to love in Marvel movies, but also takes itself very seriously.When I look back on previous MCU movies, i realize that this is one of their most beautiful movies, in terms of cinematography. The only letdown for me was the score, as in some vital spots it was barely noticeable and/or repetitive.The cast was solid throughout. The Original Six and in particular MCU Trinity take the center stage here and all do their finest acting....And just like Thor for the first time in a Long time, I genuinely don't know what's to come and that's very, very exciting...",positive
"The important part which all members ""assembled"" always makes my so moved...
I think it is worth to watch ALL marvel movies to watch this one!",positive
"This is gonna go down as one of the best movies of all times, definitely the best movie of the year.
Truly epic, funny, happy, fulfilling but sad and heartbreaking",positive
Yyyeeesssss that's the marvel movie that we need just grat and brilliant!,positive
A bit underwhelmed unfortunately. Enjoyed parts of the film but Hulk was still a pussy. Whats that all about? Cap giving falcon the shield was pointless. The ending should've been the funeral.,positive
This was a great film. It really brought everything together. Coming off infinity war half the population of earth have been killed. The avengers decide they have to find a way to change things. Tony Stark decides to help desive a time machine so they go back and save those they have lost. There are so many emotional moments in this film. We have been with all these characters for over a decade now. The special effects as always are amazing. These films really changed the game for super hero films. It showed the characters have emotional depth and back stories you can indentify with. Even the villians you can feel for. I really loved the way they tied things up. It has been an amazing ride since 2008 with the first Iron Man. Im not going give away any spoilers just take it from me this the best super hero movies in years. This has been an incredible ride. I highly recommend this film,positive
"Slow and ponderous with little or no character development or display of the talents they are supposed to have until the end of the film. The plot or storyline is simple and dull. I fell asleep in the film and my only regret is that I woke up and then had to watch the rest of the film, boring and predictable and will not engage you if you have a mental age of over about 16 or under",positive
"I have given a lower rating to this movie in the context of a follow up to infinity war. I cannot believe the hype and positive critical reviews given to this movie. There are some glaring plot holes that just cannot be ignored like
Steve Rogers going back in time and preferring to live an ordinary life with Peggy Carter and never being Captain America!
The God of Thunder and the big angry Hulk being reduced to a laughing stock.
The supporting villains seem to have absolutely no impact whatsoever rendering them redundant. and finally
Thanos - the most refreshing and complex characters of IW being reduced to a generic villain.
Robert Downing Junior is the one saving grace of the movie.",negative
It could have been better made movie as a special ending to 12 years of MCU series. Poorly scripted storyline with wasted screen time on unwanted characters.,positive
"If I'm being totally honest, I didn't like the other movies. Captain America was irritating, the hulk movies were shocking, ant man was a comedy in fact other RDJ as iron man I was never impressed.However, I binge watched the avengers movies, with one eye on the tv and one eye on my phone, last week knowing I was going to see end game in the cinema ..... and what a decision that was.My biggest mistake for movies was never watching 'the matrix' when it came out. I am glad to say that this did not happen for 'End Game'. Superb, marvelous, incredible, outstanding are only a few superlatives I can give. Quite possibly the greatest ever 'wrap up' movie I've ever seen.Fan or not, this is brilliant! 10/10.",positive
I wont spoil it but this was the perfect ending to the series. I watched the first Iron Man in theaters and every Marvel movie since then I've watched in theaters. 11 years later and this ending was satisfying and perfect. Me and my husband both cried,positive
"This is a fantastic movie. Everyone must love it. This is the most Sci-fi film I have ever seen. Here, all the avengers went to past to fetch the infinity stones that were caught by thanos (in present). From the past, the avengers got the infinity stones and they came in the present to fight with thanos. In the war of thanos and avengers, at last Iron man get dies with thonos, which is the most heart breaking seen of the movie.",positive
"I remember way back when Iron man 1 came out and now awesome I thought that movie was, not even aware that nearly 11 years later I would be sitting in a theatre basically close to tears as Iron man dies. With the exception of 2 of the mcu movies I have seen all of the them in theatres and they hold a very dear place in my heart. That's what makes this movie so satisfying and why it works so well. I was so deeply invested with each and everyone of these characters that I felt every moment. All the cast and crew bring there A games here and probably created what will likely be one of my favourite movies of all time. Chris Evans (captain America) and Robert Downey Jr probably give the best performances in my opinion. I'm happy with the end to both of there arcs told through out these past 11 years and 22 movies. Tony has always been willing to put his life on the line to save the world and we get to see that come full circle here as he kills himself to destroy Thanos and his army knowing that pepper and his daughter will be safe. And Steve gets the life he longer for with Peggy. I don't think any mcu movie will ever top this one but I can honestly say I will always be there to watch them whenever they come out. This movie was reply the end of an era for me.",positive
"I enjoyed every moment,
but I have to say that infinity war was a little better.I have objections here and there but the great action and comedy makes up for it..Overall It's a fully satisfactory conclusion..
3 hours well spent..",positive
"It may have just been the high expectations set by the reviews, but this movie is not as good as the internet is making it out to be. Infinity War, in my opinion, was a much much stronger film overall. This was very poorly paced, had some really bad attempts of humour, and a lot of unnecessary scenes. The actual plot was quite good and kept me engaged, but the execution was lacking. Don't go into the cinema with high expectations because you may be disappointed.",positive
"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10",positive
"I knew things would get messed up as soon as they went time-travel.Now I'm going to spend more time trying to figure out all the time travel goof ups they ignored and being disappointed at the conclusions you end up coming toConclusions:There are now 3 separate times lines:One where Thanos succeeds and everyone is still in shock trying to recover and canon still holds and our heroes are left grieving and torn apart.Another where Thanos dies and doesn't succeed and things go forward from canon.And a third where Thanos dies, never exists, neither do Gamora and Nebula as we know them, Captain America never comes in to the 21st century, Avengers never happen and canon is totally obliterated.But everyone remembers, which is also a time travel goof up.And I'm sure I can come up with a bunch more, if I keep thinking about it.Disappointing to say the least.I never watched any of the Iron Man movies because an Avengers movie was just enough of exposure of his character to suit me. An entire movie series of just him would have me trying to blind and deafen myself. So I never watched them. That lack made me not even tear up at his sacrifice.To all those who wonder how Cap could wield the Hammer? We got the hint he could do it way back in Avengers: Age of Ultron. During the party, they were all doing the ""Are you worthy?"" game and took turns trying to lift the hammer.Thor and the audience saw the hammer move when Cap ""tried"" to lift it. Rumor was back then, he could move it, but chose to not reveal it. Rumor proved true.The ending battle, while epic, was, after a awhile, like watching a very ornate video game. Unlike the massive Infinity War battle, done in bright sunlight where the actors were very evident, this was done in a dark setting and at most, you saw a few seconds of the real actor before being replaced by CGI for most of the rest of the action. Disappointing. I didn't want to see a big video game.The stealing of the stones to resolve the whole issue was also lame. Why didn't they do this in Infinity Wars? Instead of trying to steal the whole gauntlet, why not just take the stones? Or even a few of them?You could see the Russo's trying to satisfy fan questions from the last movie:Why didn't they just cut off Thanos' arm? They did it here.
Why didn't Thor go for the head ? He does here.Also disappointing was Steve offering the shield to Wilson instead of Bucky.Stan Lee's cameo came and went so fast I didn't know it was him.All in all, for me, a anti-climatic end for the series, ending with a whimper instead of a bang. As far as the Marvel series goes, this isn't one of its best and that's sad for the last one.",positive
"Its probably the first marvel movie where i was playing with my phone and that says a lot.
Its a boring movie, full of plot holes, only 20min of fight scenes in total and drama. LOTS and LOTS of drama, moaning and crying again and again.So, to sum it up:
* Plot holes not even the biggest fans can ignore.
* Inconsistencies between the movies.
* Way too many characters, just to appear on the movie, doing basically nothing.
* Huge changes to main characters, making them also useless.
* Almost no fight scenes! Set the alarm clock after 120min in the movie.
* Drama, crying, moaning, REPEAT.You have been warned, but it doesn't matter because you will ignore all the negative reviews and still go and see the movie. That's what i did, the same mistake. Go grab a pizza and watch Arrow, trust me you'll have better time.",negative
What a way to end 10 years of marvel! Prepare yourself.,positive
"The movie was amazing for me and all other fans of Marvel for sure. If you ain't a fan it doesn't mean that you won't like it. You'll enjoy it due to comedy, action and something more. You might like something else from the movie. It depends on you. I think it would be worth spending your time on watching it.
Thank you,

"This was the first time that I watched the film of this series and I was feeling bad about what I have missed by not watching any of the movie of this series.
The VFX, CGI work is amazing because of which it looks amazing on screen especially in 3D",positive
I loved the movie and thoroughly enjoyed the whole time travel premise. But I just wonder how Thor's hammer could be there when it was destroyed in Ragnarok... if it was from the past wouldn't Thor have missed it while it was not with him?,positive
"Avengers: Endgame was a masterpiece of epic proportions. With all the iconic characters coming together for one final last time to face the mighty and evil Thanos. Every characted is tested equally in endgame with a mighty dose of colour and CGI Special Effects with such crisply shot action scenes and an incredible soundtrack to boot, it will blow your mind and is a must see for any Marvel fan.With a hefty three hour run time the time will fly very quick for you with such an exciting story with incredible emotional and narrative heft, it's an incredible achievement from Marvel and will have you guessing just how the story will continue in the future",positive

"I really loved this movie , more than perfect and smart. I just hate this movie when I saw iron man died, but after the conclusion I just realized there will be no perfect ending better than this. The writing and time travel concepts are brilliant , what I meant it is perfect. I really missed hulk smash, that is the one thing I miss in this movie. When I think , there is no cap (Robert jr and chris) and iron man I just hate MCU but I really thank for this wonderful journey.",positive
"""If you build it, he will come"". Those words from the ""Field of Dreams"", came to mind after I finished watching it's last night. Without a doubt, a perfect ending for an era for a team of a beloved superheroes. Those three phases of building up to this moment in my mind, actually can be counted as one huge incredible project building up for this moment. Despite its ups and downs, this entire project can be considered as a great work of cinematic art, which gave us many hours of interest, speculations and pure enjoyment. Even the worst movies of the universe so far, which are captain Marvel and Thor 2, fall into their place as a bit unpolished pieces of the puzzle. The movie itself wasn't perfect story wise, there are some story loopholes, but it worked perfectly on many many levels. The only thing that bothered me, was out of character, pure ""strong woman power"" moment in the last battle, which is so popular in the movies these days, as this moment actually goes against the spirit of the movie, which basically all light against all darkness at the end. Despite this minor glitch, I gave it a pure 10/10 as a work of cinematic art, which concluded over a decade of hard work. Shame, Stan Lee is not alive to see his vision come to live on screen. He would love that.",positive
"Although we never get to see the more practical aspects of a rapture-like disappearance of half of all living creatures from the universe, we do get to see some obvious indicators that something is no longer right, existentially. For example, people have let their lawns go to weeds, no one figured out how to play baseball with half the teams, and everyone is afraid of dating, presumably out of fear that Thanos might snap his finger again to further reduce the dating pool, with a a 50-50 shot of either you or your lover disappearing into wispy-black confetti, like Rip Taylor on a cold and rainy afternoon in January.It all begs a few questions, such as why was it not viewed as a positive thing, a Malthusian reprieve from overpopulation and a break from resource competition? Could it not have been the requisite spark for labor to unionize and rebuild a strong middle class, something like what happened in Europe after the Black Death? Seriously, couldn't half the Mets and half the Yankees form one good team to play a team comprised of half the Royals and half the Cardinals? Who is running the nuclear power plants? Why does everyone drive Audis? The Fortnite servers are still up? Why was the 50-50 shot so cruelly applied to Hawkeye? Why not grab the Time Stone first? Were the first 21 movies necessary? Oh, and good thing we still have rats running around storage units, am I right?Thor, channeling his inner Moondog, has let himself go to weeds, sad and drunk and fat, playing video games all day with couch buddies. Friends are still important, and the hallmark of real friendship can be hidden in a hard-shell taco.End Game comes with some satisfying cameo reprises, a handful of genuine laughs related to butts and pee, some nice and tender moments, and ultimately a time heist which has to go awry somehow, someway, to justify three hours of cinematic universe.I keep wondering to myself, why, why does Thanos want to . . . whatever. At least the final moments are filmed brightly enough to understand what is going on, and all the heroes get to play rugby with a magical gauntlet. Or maybe it was Australian Rules Football?",positive
"The dumbing down of Hulk and ruining his character by turning him into an utter wimp, turning Thor into a bumbling drunkard, really? Well done Disney on ruining yet another couple of hero's characters (See Luke Skywalker and Yoda in Disney's Last Jedi for extra confirmation of this) That's all I've got to say about this movie.",negative
Amazing cast amazing performances...its successful not just as a superhero movie but as a film in general,positive
"My undying passion for films (and other media) always lingered since I was a baby. That being said, my passion for this craft exploded when I saw the Earth's Mightiest Heroe's team up in 2012. Marvel Studios had something special on their hands with The Avengers, then Cap: TWS, then Guardians of the Galaxy, then Civil War.... and so on.
They almost always one-upped themselves in terms of quality as each subsequent movie came out. The journey that we experience with these Heroe's is so very special, and I'm grateful for it. I always love visiting these stories every time they put out a film. (Trying my best not to sound preachy here haha!) I know some of this may sound silly, but these heroes have always been important to me.
Marvel studios have always delivered (at least for me). They released my favourite film of all time - Infinity War, last year and I really didn't think they had it in them to top it.
Lo and Behold, Endgame was perfect. It resonated with me on so many levels. I'm not going to go into specifics, because I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone, but these are the reasons why I absolutely, wholeheartedly love Avengers Endgame:
As comics coming to life - there were scenes that EXPLODED my mind. I cheered my lungs out opening night.
As a deep dive into characters - I felt the repercussions of the previous event that took place, I love the way they handled ""loss"". I was emotionally taken by the well-written script as well as the acting that carried the perfect slow-pace of the first half of the movie. The characters dealing with the snap in their own ways was executed so well. Connected with them on a whole other level. Loved the pacing of the film. I also love how each character has grown; If you go back to the early movies and then you watch endgame... Our beloved Heroes are fundamentally the same, with we'll set morals, though they've grown for the better over the years and continue to do so in this one. Growth of astoundingly well-made characters you care about should be commended.
As for the laughs - there were so many of them, such great ones that landed 95% of the time. Well written comedy that I ate up. I think the comedy this time around was sprinkled in at better moments, that never broke the seriousness of a scene (when compared to something like Guardians 2...). A lot of fun laughs to be had ay!
As of the action - FREAKING PHENOMENAL. I Screamed, I Cheered, I Clapped. I tend not to burst out with the above in theatres, but I couldn't hold myself back... Trust me, I tried. So well done. The entire third act is something to behold.
As for the music - Alan Silvestri, take a bow. The Avengers theme is so iconic now, thank you for giving that to us. Thank you for using it so well in this film and thank you for creating new tracks that I know I'm going to listen to on repeat. The soundtrack was seamlessly awesome in this film!
As for the directing & acting - The Russo Brothers... Alright, I'm not going to say anything more than I have before. You guys are the best, really, how y'all handle these mammoth tasks with perfection is beyond me. The two of you are crazy amazing. The actors brought their A game as always too. The movie focused on the core 6 avengers with a few exceptions here and there. RDJ & Evans took my breath away once again, but PAUL RUDD is a huge standout to me coming out of this. The way he handles his lovable Ruddness brand of humour with so much emotional depth in this film is brilliant. Scar Jo, Renner, Ruffalo, Hemsworth... You guys. I loved all of them, I don't want to pick out any favourites because they all played their roles to beyond perfection.
As for the heart - Endgame, after one viewing has become my favourite movie of all time. This movie strung together a fresh, cool, heavy, yet satisfying plot with such care. Characters and Heart make or break a film for me, and Endgame is a prime example of how well the two are executed. I was emotionally drained at the end of the movie. I screamed my lungs off, I laughed my butt off and my lord, I uncontrollably cried my eyes out... Yet by the end of it all, I walked out with the biggest smile on my face. Thank you for this gift Marvel Studios.A thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.",positive
Highly recommend watching especially if you enjoyed infinity wayA must watch for all Marvel fans.,positive
"The way they did the time travel makes things a lot confusing. Captain Marvel was too powerful. Thanos could have also used the infinity gems during the fight. The part were everything exploded, come on somebody should have died there.",positive
"It is full of Hype and exciting ,a great ending, you won't regret watching it at all!",positive
"I just have to said that im grateful for this movie. The effects, the characters is all amazing. I love how its sad joyeful and a lot of emotions in a movie.",positive
Okay I'm waited a long time to watch the movie and I've got to say I'm pretty disappointed first they made two of the biggest stars into jokes thor is a fat sloppy drunk and hulk is a big green Sissy I don't even think Hulk threw a punch everyone wanted to see all the heroes come back and they did but they lost one of the greats at the end could have been so much better,positive
"Normally there are a lot of plot holes in these kind of movies (the ones HISHE delve into and make you mad later) but other than one, I honestly can't think of any. The writers do an incredible job of tying up everything into exactly what the audience has been waiting for. You will laugh cheer and definitely cry, and it's all worth it.",positive
"I'm not much of a superhero fan but I watch and enjoy any good movie regardless of the genre. This one had problems like plot inconsistencies and the biggest one for me was softening down Thor's character. This is mainly because the writers didn't have a choice because in the previous installment Thor nearly killed Thanos singlehanded with his hand thing with rocks on but they couldn't do it in this one because then they have to cut it short. And the other one is why cap gets Thor's powers? Like lifting the hammer is one thing and I would have enjoyed him lifting the hammer and hitting someone with it but all the lightning and summoning the hammer by just holding his hand out was terrible. I won't get in to the time travel thing, I like time travel movies but this one didn't have to have it because this one would have succeeded anyway without it, maybe more.Pacing was not good too, not giving all the stars the screen time they deserved. Hardly saw hulk do any action. Wait we hardly saw anyone do any action. Only 15 mins. I'm not an action fan but still this is an action movie. Could have done wonders with all the stars but we ended up just getting this.",positive
"All i want to say that. Take away 22 movies and a fanbase from endgame. It is nothing but a pile of dust. Endgame stands on the base of Marvel reputation. Alone, its trash. Silly and total cringe.
Thanks for making Thor a clown. Its just for memes",negative
"After 8 years Avengers ends on a high note with an epic battle against Thanos and his army for the final time. If you have 3 hours and are a superhero watch this recommended on the largest HD TV you can find. I am no big superhero comic collector so I am very behind, but who does not love a Marvel action movie?",positive
"I had to see this one in Spanish since I'm an American living in Spain. After the near flawless Infinity War, it would be hard for this one to live up to its predecessor, and the expectations are high. I would hate to be the one responsible for this movie.The first hour is really slow. In fact, I didn't even know where this movie was even going after the first twenty minutes. But then in the second hour, it's almost an homage to all the Marvel movies that came before it with a lot of fan service thrown in. A lot goes on, and it may even require someone with knowledge of all the Marvel movies to get it. The third hour is the final battle and its really good and emotional. I even teared up in a couple parts and I couldn't even make out what they were saying.However, there are some questionable things that happen in the movie like what happens to Hulk and Thor. I would like to say that they didn't screw up on Captain Marvel. They handled her well. I guess we are going into Phase four, but the only one I'm interested in is the next Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm not sure if I'm sticking around after this one. Then again, Marvel has been genius when it comes to these films.",positive
"Avenger Endgame was a long awaited movie that really payed of waiting for these years. From the start of this wonderful franchise that had its ups and downs this movie really did a great job about ending this whole SAGA that last full 10 years across 23(i think) movies. That deserves an absolute 10.But regarding Avengers as a movie i did have a couple of problems with it. Just to say that this is a well crafted movie and directors especially actors and stunt enseble team deserve much praise. Its 3 hour runtime can feel a bit because of its sad tone and character interactions in the first hour of the movie but i liked it because it fit for my taste because of the Infinity wars ending.Second problem I had is with some of its comedy and scenes that were pointless like Hulk giving tacos etc.
And the last problem i had is with that girl power scene it felt very cringy and it was absolutely unnecessary because they did that much better in Infinity war.Everything else in the movie carried so much emotinal weight that made me impressed. I rarely see the movie that can gather so much people to watch and to make most of them leave the theaters heart broken. I can not compare this movie with other big superhero movies like Joker and The Dark Knight because they do seperate things.This movie is 10 for me because of the ending that made me cry for these characters for the last time. If they screwed up the ending it would be 8.5.Cant wait to see what MARVEL brings us in the upcoming SAGA!!",positive

Epic closure of the sequel which sets the bar really high for any future Marvel productions. Incredible plot.,positive
"I liked the movie however I think they kinda made the pace really slow, the first Infinity had way more action.Either way It had an epic ending for our heroes and I think they did a great job with that.",positive
"Lets be truly honest, it's ok, it's too long, see it once....and many things are just too absurd ... Thor's storyline for one. Nebula's story line for two.Acting was fine. Everyone was fine. But you'd think for a three hour movie there would be more inter-Avenger dialog, especially between Natasha and Cap and Clint and Banner because she's attempted relationships with all three and now that half the people are gone and she cries a lot don't you think any of the other three would want to have a relationship?Frankly Infinity War was at least as good.",positive
"There has never been any kind of cinematic event like it and there may never be one again, but Endgame is the kind of superheroic fanservice most people have only dreamed of.",positive
Lets be honest... Avengers Infinity War was 1000x better than Endgame.,positive
"I am still trying to grapple with what their ""endgame"" was...
This is the very last movie with all the hype around it, and supposed to be THE grand culmination of all earlier 21 MCU movies.However, this is what actually happens -
Thor plays Fat Boy Slim.
Dr. Strange has as many lines to speak as Groot has.
Captain Marvel's only job is to ferry Iron Man's lost ship on her shoulders.
Captain America does not remain Captain America in the end. And simply by physical proximity, Black Panther becomes the new Captain America (I would have taken my shoe off and thrown at the screen, but hey, this scene wasn't worth the price of even my shoes).The only saving grace was perhaps the demise of Iron Man.They basically did a Game of Thrones finale on this one it seems. Maybe 2019 will be remembered as the year when all movie makers lost it.",negative
"It made laugh it made me cry it made excited. This movie is a true love letter to the fans.They promised and they delivered. This is 11 years in the making, and i have to say it worth the wait ! GO WATCH IT ! ITS EPIC!!",positive
"This is simply the greatest super-heroe movie that I watched, have everything that a geek needed, its a huge tribute about everything that MCU represents, its shocking how they got all the events get work in 3 hours (and I have to say that don't look soo long), it's very emotional, beauty photography, and amazing visual effects! The plot it's impeccable, the action it's incredible, it's a big war and I just screamed out loud and vibrated with many moments that I just didn't wait, in fact you can perceive that it is the end, and I cry very bad, and still i'm crying remembering every things. This is it, Marvel got it again.",positive

"Spoiler free review here.If you are invested at all in any of the Marvel characters, than this is a must see. It was a perfect conclusion to the first three phases of the MCU and it makes us wonder where they can go next that'll feel new and fresh. Worth watching, ignore the haters and negative reviews. Sure there are plot holes but we're talking about a universe in which a guy created his own element and an entire country uses a metal as basically magic and says its technology. Every Marvel movie has plot holes, this one is no exception.",positive
"It is so difficult to express what a person that just saw the film feels. Completion, astonishment, wonder, surprise, happiness, sadness are just a few words that come to my mind at the moment that help me describe what I saw. This film has it everything! Plot twists, an amazing storyline, tributes to the past movies, humor, tears and everything you wanted this long-waited Marvel film to have. 3 is just the real number in hours for how long the film is, but in reality when it starts until it finishes, you forget that number completely by how immersive and well made this film is! This is the best film Marvel has made so far and is one unbelievable way to conclude 21 movies and 10 years worth of MCU history.
Joe and Anthony Russo, Thank you!",positive
"First of all, the action in this movie is the best I've seen in any Marvel movie. It beats out some iconic scenes trust me. All the actors in this film did amazing jobs. From when we first see them to now you can see the character growth that has developed in them. This film is three-hours-and-two-minutes long but really you never feel it. You're so engaged in this movie and the characters that the time just flies by so quickly and every second in this film is important. I feel like if they got rid of anything in this film it would take away from something. That something being the emotion in this film. There is so much emotion in this film that even one scene being removed would've ruined it. In the end, Avengers: Endgame is a great wrap up and final goodbye to this part of the MCU. Just make sure if you have a soul to bring tissues with you.",positive

"Thinking the movie went too far down captain America could get the hammer then it went too far. When silly things happen, I think the movie may be bad",positive
"""It wasn't as good as Infinity War."" That was all I could say as I stumbled home after two in the morning. It's taken some time, but I'm starting to understand why.The biggest problem I had with this film was how all the superheroes seemed to act as if ""The Snap"" happened only to them and no one else. The entire first act shows the cast depressed because they lost, and because of who they lost among their group. While this is understandable, it seems to be the only thing they care about. They only want to avenge the loss of their own loved ones, not the horror suffered by the rest of Earth.This isn't just my interpretation of the writing - the effect on the rest of humanity is almost completely hidden from view. As to the larger global cataclysm, we only get a few glimpses - Hawkeye's family, a memorial in San Francisco, a few people who show up to Captain America's grief counseling group. Other than that, we're merely told about the larger effects of that moment, such as when Black Widow states the Earth's governments are in ruins. It too well concealed the terror suffered by so many others on Earth, as if the writers themselves weren't sure how to convey the magnitude of the act.At the same time, the film assumes the surviving humans all know that Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet were the reason behind half of the world disappearing. This raised several questions:First - how would they know that? Was humanity ever told that Thanos would wipe out half of existence if The Avengers failed? Do they even know what the Infinity Gauntlet is? Who would've been there to see it when it happened outside Wakanda's secluded African community? When people saw others turn to dust, wouldn't they think it was terrorism, a plague, or something entirely different?Second, if they were told, who did it? How did everyone react when they heard? And wouldn't they be upset at The Avengers for failing to stop Thanos? Why, five years later, would some kids walk up to The Hulk and take a selfie with him as if nothing had happened? You'd think our heroes would have been chased into hiding, not hanging out in their perfectly functioning headquarters to quip at each other.Much like ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and the Anime ""Sword Art Online,"" ""Endgame"" relies on a sudden jump forward in time to avoid answering these and other compelling questions. It is in the five years after ""The Snap"" that we could have learned more about humanity's response to the disaster, and how if at all The Avengers were blamed. After all, we know from the very beginning of the MCU, when Tony Stark reveals his secret identity, that humans know superheroes exist. It's these interactions between humans and the heroes that have driven much of the narrative in the MCU.But instead, at this most critical time, we're simply moved ahead to a moment of tenuous calm, thus allowing the Marvel brand of humor to continue despite the unfathomable tragedy. To the film's detriment, this isn't the most interesting time for the story to take place. And to make it worse, humanity has absolutely no role in shaping the narrative of the story. We're not even certain everyone comes back after The Avengers craft a gauntlet of their own - it's all done symbolically, without any of the emotion or consequence.As if gripped by the same depression of the film's characters, we're then thrown head-long into a ridiculous time travel plot that fills the film's second half. Thanks to the film's greatest hero - a rat - Ant-Man returns from out of nowhere, and while stuck in the Quantum Realm also seems to suddenly understand everything about time travel despite being a common thief. Tony Stark's concept of building a time machine also comes to him from out of nowhere. It would've been interesting to see this plan be an act of desperation by brutally depressed characters, all of them knowing the act is impossible, but just looking for something to do.But, of course, it works, and the film then partakes in its true passion - celebrating the MCU itself. Like a terrible clip show from a long-running show, much of what follows is everything you've already seen from nearly two dozen films, re-enacted all over again. It's quaint for hardcore fans of the series, but for me, it left me wondering if something more interesting could've been done in its place. The film can't even escape making the same mistake so many other films do by couching their time-travel plan in terms of still other movies, like ""Back To The Future"" and even ""Hot Tub Time Machine.""The inevitable over-indulgent fight signals the end of the film, featuring a chorus line of all the characters coming back as if preparing to take a final bow. It's the big applause moment of the film, but somehow still comes off rushed. We don't get any understanding of what it was like when each of them came back, and what effect it had on their loved ones left behind. We don't understand - other than a few lines from Spider-Man - what it felt like to be one of the murdered from Infinity War. It's at this moment you realize why they didn't show anyone else come back after the second ""Snap"" - once again, humanity took a back seat to allow the superheroes a dramatic entrance. But, for a three-hour film, it really lacked the weight the writers were clearly going for.In the fight itself, we're treated to many absurdities. The maligned Captain Marvel, who after nearly ending the film all by herself in the first five minutes literally told the audience ""you're not going to see me for a while,"" shoots in from out of nowhere and effortlessly destroys a ship, just as she had in her own film. She then joins a group of female superheroes who pointlessly pose for a moment, then unlike the male characters screaming and attacking, choose to scream and attack. On top of this ""Force Is Female"" crap, the whole sequence is shot like a DC fight scene, complete with an ugly brown filter over the colorful characters. But, hey, when it's all over, Thanos gets to die a second time.To round things off, the film follows ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" in gleefully letting the past die. While Iron Man gets an epic and dignified death - unwillingly, having started a family of his own - others aren't so fortunate. Captain America voluntarily becomes old, handing over his shield to his black friend Falcon. More wokeness ensues when Thor, transformed by depression into ""The Big Lebowski,"" hands over the keys to his sad little village to the Valkyrie woman from ""Ragnarok"" who can't act. One after the other, your favorite superheroes survive their greatest challenge only to voluntarily give up the reigns to a group far less interesting or talented. Then the actors sign their names ""Star Trek"" style, you wait 11 minutes for no after credits sequence, and its finally time to go pee.Once again, even in this biggest and most anticipated superhero film, this is yet another example of writers not taking the time to play with an idea and make their story the very best it could be. It's not a terrible film, but it's not a complete one, either. Tragically caught between racial and sexual politics, rabid fans, and Disney corporate, it lets a little too much of the outside world water-down a good story.",negative
"Avengers Endgame is about the remaining Avengers trying to get the world back to normal. They run into many problems though.Avengers Endgame was a great movie. First, the acting was great. All the actors in this movie did a great job. The story was also great. It made me feel like it wasn't 3 hours. All the story telling made it feel like the movie wouldn't have been as good without some of the story. Also the acting was great. I know it has been in most of the films but I still had to congratulate it. There was also many great scenes in this movie. The ending was just really moving and awesome.Overall, Avengers Endgame was a great movie.",positive
This is the best ending ever !!!!!!! So magical 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍,positive
"Thoroughly enjoyed a way throw and builds with great momentum, not only is this an action movie so much emotion that slowly builds, I loved the development & build up leading to its finale conclusion, this is what visiting cinema is all about and leaving on a high.This is more then a part 2 of End Game but very much it's own movie that leads to its bitter sweet ending.Director brothers who decided less advertising / marketing prove this is vital to ensure been moments / scenes are left for the audience to discover as it unravels on the big s screen, well done guys!",positive
"The movie makes you laugh, cry, and walk out filling fulfilled. Watching every movie, going on the rollercoaster with them. One that every marvel fan should enjoy!!!!",positive
"The Russo brothers once again bring an epic showdown with our favorite heroes. The movie isn't necessarily a cult classic what with it breaking box office records and what not, but wrapping up ten years of relatable, colorful, and well-directed action films is certainly something to go for. It's hard telling exactly what will happen next when it comes to the future success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it's likely not going to top the current momentum for a while, if ever. Overall, the film has a fairly complex yet understandable storyline and is pretty unpredictable at times. It should remain quite a classic to MCU fans like myself and not just Marvel fans in general (i.e. Comic books, Stan Lee, etc.).",positive
Im not gonna spoil this. Full of emotions out there... sacrifice... love ... and action..❤,positive
"It's the next day after I've seen Endgame and I still don't quite know what to make of it. So I'll mention the downsides first: 1) Infinity War was a mess, there was just too much thrown at you without making much sense; to expect the audience to recall all the ins and outs of Infinity War was asking a little much; 2) they do some real interesting things here, particularly time travel, but don't overthink (or even partially think) the real complications or it will ruin it for you; 3) some of the stuff that happens either doesn't make sense or runs counter to earlier Avenger movies, and 4) the raccoon from Guardians shouldn't have had a major role. Plus a bonus complaint, how they treated Thor was stupid. On the plus side: 1) the sheer weight of the movie is spectacular, with a few exceptions the CGI doesn't get in the way of the story; 2) the logistics of the plot allows some of our favorite characters to do something magical, deserving and sometimes quite unexpected; 3) the work by nearly all of the main actors is quite good.
So to recap the Avengers book: 1 was the best superhero movie ever; 2 was a disappointing bust; 3 had too much to work with but some of it was good stuff; and 4 was enjoyable with some moderate reservations.",positive
"Marvel done very well and know what we as a fans want. Some of the movie lines u won't know if u not a hardcore marvel fans. The story plot caught me by surprise that it can done in this way. Every emotion u can think of, all can find in this movie.I like Black widow performance in this movie.",positive
"The bulk of the film is set five years after the events of Infinity Wars.Ok let's start with the negatives:
CGI of some of our favourite characters appear to be slightly on the poor side. The CGI is quite noticable in some scenes.Secondly...It's very long and as a whole does not have much action. It is more dramatic. This is not a bad thing, however some fans may expect more action in this genre of film.On a postive note, it brings the characters back together very well.Unfortunately it appears this film too has become a victim of ""feminism"", with an unnecessary girl power ""we got this"" scene featuring Captain Marvel and a number of supporting female cast. Why unnecessary? Because viewers will note that Captain Marvel could have quite easily conducted the task at hand with little or no assistance.The cast have done a great job with plenty of little cameo's from our favourite and not so favourite characters of the MCU. The film presents itself as a good wrap up to the 22 film series. Prepare yourselves for some laughs and for some tears.Btw...there is no post credit scene so no need to wait till the end of the rolling credits.If you have an opportunity, go watch the film at the cinemas as it is still worth the watch in a cinematic environment. Just make sure you go to the toilet before the movie starts due to the length of the film.Happy watching!A job well done to both producers and directors.",positive
"I dont even wanna spend my time here writing how bad the movie and the story was, it was just soooooooooo awful",negative
"Its finally here. The moment we've all been waiting for. Avengers Endgame is now in cinemas and you should go watch it right now. I don't know how many times I plan on watching it but it is worth every penny no matter how many times you plan on watching it because it's that good. Forget good, it's great. Forget great, its spectacular.Avengers Endgame takes place immediately after last year's heart-stopping Infinity War cliffhanger where our surviving heroes are in grief of what happened and the rest for you to watch. This is by far the best Marvel movie ever made. Endgame is the conclusion of a journey we've all been going throughout 22 movies. It is a worthy end to the original six Avengers arcs, leaving space for our new superheroes to take their place and lead a whole new generation of Marvel-lous storytelling. But let's not talk about the future, we are focusing on Endgame here.Unlike Infinity War, the stakes are higher, the drama is wells up in you constantly and the sheer epicness of what makes this Avengers installment so perfect is that from beginning to end, you will laugh, cry or have goosebumps all over your body. The highlight of the movie was, of course, our beloved six original Avengers, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Making them the main focus once again after so long was a step at the right direction and it would totally make sense since we all know that Endgame will be their last movie together. The best among them all was Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. Finally seeing them together after havoc that was Civil War and working together, trusting each other again was an absolute treat for all us fans.I can't tell you anything about the storyline for that I would be spoiling you but I can tell you the 3 hour runtime was worth it. Come to think of it, it didn't feel like I was watching it for 3 hours for that I wasn't bored or looking at the time. No scene felt pointless or draggy. The entire 3 hours keeps you attentive, at the edge of your seat and makes sure your eyes do not get to miss a single second. The pace seemed familiar to all famous fantasy epics such as Lord of The Rings and Game of Thrones. Like LOTR and GOT, they focused more on character development and getting the audience to experience what the characters going through as well. With that, there are the epic battle scenes and the epic score to go with it. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely outdid themselves making their most complicated and best Marvel script ever. Alan Silvestri returned to write the score once again and outdid himself by including themes from all the previous movies including his previous scores from Captain America The First Avenger and the main Avengers theme by making it them sound more brassier and bigger, fitting the to the scope and tone of Endgame.So, Endgame. Go watch it. Marvel fan or not, do not miss the epic finale to the Infinity Saga of the MCU. If you do end up missing it, you should live under rock or kill yourself with a rock. With that I'm rating Avengers Endgame 12/10 because it exceeded all my expectations of a great Marvel movie. I thought Infinity War was spectacular but Endgame, there is still no words I can find to explain what the movie or how it made me feel, not only as a Marvel but as a moviegoer which makes Endgame even more of a superhero spectacle than Infinity War.P.S. unfortunately, there is no post credit scenes or end credit scenes",positive
"What a film. That ending has got to be one of the best endings out there. At the start it was slow but gradually picked up pace with the time travelling, which I enjoyed. This followed onto the big battle (ending) where everyone came back to beat the s**t out of thanos and his goons. What a way to end things and am sceptical to see what they do next with the characters left but am looking forward to it. Laughed all the way through and was a great follow up on infinity war. Would highly recommend a watch at the cinema as it's much better with a crowd of elite fans with you. It gets a 10 from me.",positive
"This movie contains everything that a comic based superheros movie must have. It has perfectly timed funny jokes, Jaw dropping action scenes and an unpredictable story with various twists. Also acting of everyone is awesome. If you have seen all the previous marvel movies then you are surely going to love this one, if you haven't watched I recommend you to do so or else you won't understand some important things in this movie.",positive
"Avengers:Endgame is a superhero film we all yearned for after the Infinity war spectacle and The Dark Knights standard but this film surely was far beyond expectations and was gripping entertaining humorous and emotional.
Yes the movie kicks off to a slow start about the Avengers still learning and moving on from their loss but they found a way to reverse the ruins. Thanos the mad titan and the villain again proved to be one of the best villains abd surely some competition for the Avengers.
It is a movie which will stun you
This movie is a Perfect 10/10",positive
"Most awaited movie of this decade is here today & YES I saw it the very first show of it & right now I am speechless. Russo Brothers has nailed it. Its not a movie its an emotion for all the Marvel Fans who waited exactly for a year to know what will happen after Infinity War & now we just got this.Endgame is a must watch & may be watched again & again for true fans. Till you read this review & probably those most will not be reading this too, biggest Marvel fans would either have watched this or will be watching this & for those who dint get tickets today will have booked tickets for tomorrow any how.Won't be taking this too long as writing anything about movie will not be right. So you will find emotions, action, comedy, anger ,love just everything.Just one word for this movie BRILLIANT. Book your tickets for this anyday the tickets are available & its a MUST WATCH. GO FOR IT.RATING : 5/5",positive

"Objectively it's a decent movie. But as someone who was simply BLOWN away by Infinity War. This movie just left me plain confused. There are so many giant plot holes. The script seems rushed. Not well planned out. And maybe the term ""snooze fest"" is a bit harsh. But the movie builds up really slow. Only to reach a point that is very predictable. For me, just too bad for it's potential.",positive
"Emotional, Impactful, Heartbreaking, Action-Packed, and Hilarious. Endgame is truly the culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's 22 film ""Infinity Saga"" and pulls out all the stops for this film, wrapping everything up in a tight bow that feels as beautiful as it is entertaining.",positive
"So I enjoyed this movie and have to say it was very good however just a few things that let this movies down.. firstly it was slow for the first half of the movie.. secondly I think The way they prorated Thor was a joke, I think he was excellent in the Infinity War... Hulk was also a joke... I wanted to see some more Hulk Smash rather than a jokey fool... as for captain marvel she was better in this movie than her standalone movie.. small doses are best..My biggest disappointment was Thanos.... he made the first movie.. the perfect villain having all the flavours of the most unique villain I have seen... I really wanted to see more of him and actually see him in more fight scenes..Taking that all into account I will still say it's a very good movie.. the final battle scene was very good however would have really enjoyed more of it.. I loved the graphics and really enjoyed all the Marvel characters in the final fight scene..Defo worth a watch but no way as good as the first",positive
"Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe I expected more elegant & complex solutions. But what this movie gave to me was huge disappointment - with a little fun here & there (mostly includes Thor). In the end, Infinity War remained as far more better movie.",negative
"Steve Rogers went back through time and stayed there he alters his time in the present because he's a old man in the universe that he should be young.So in the present day the Steve messed up his time lineAlso to note the Thanos they snapped out of existence is not the same Thanos that was decapitated on Titan.Also Note Gamora is back but from a different time as is The Nebula imposter that was from the past was killed by her future self....
So this leaves Natasha Black Widow..she can come back,
but as her past self as we saw her in the Battle of New York etc.",positive

"Now, I know I'm not a movie critic but I can tell you that this movie definitely does it's job. Endgame was one of my fave movies definitely and it succeeded and I like seeing this franchise succeeded. Though at some times the writing did get a little repetitive onto infinity war it still did it's job and provided. Also someone tell the producers fortnite isn't a good game! The deaths are extremely sad. Cried only on the one though aka the girl death! Honestly great movie great wrap up. This franchise deserves so many movies to come!",positive
Satiating end Game hulked with relevancy We loved three thousand~jodawa.,positive
"A culmination of character arcs, narrative threads, a decade of cinema history, and like so many films in the MCU before, the guiding theme boils down to this: ""Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be; the measure of a person, a hero, is how they succeed at being who they are."" No doubt, I have my quibbles---""I amâ¦an Avenger"" would have kept something of the parallelism, but with a deeper sense of growth and better ethics---and some confusion, but at just over three hours long while carrying the weight of so many franchises, that is to be expected. At bottom, having already invested so many hours and years into these characters and these films, these stars and these stories, the mark of success is the emotional resonance and historic importance pushing the possibility of the medium (and its economic footing) forward, not the cinematic flourishes or compelling performances or memorable quips---that the film has a few of those, too, is merely a bonus.",positive
"I want to start this review off by saying that I am the farthest thing from an MCU fanboy. Try as I might, I've never loved these movies to the level that I always felt that I should as a diehard Marvel comics fan. That's not to say that there haven't been some genuinely great films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but there have been just as many misses as hits for me and I have yet to see one fully live up to the boundless potential of the rich source material. I didn't even like Infinity War, or the original Avengers for that matter. I say all of this so that when I make the claim that Avengers: Endgame may be the best superhero film of all time, you know I'm coming from a place of sincerity and not bias. I've waited 11 years to feel this way about an MCU film and now that I do, it feels incredible.Endgame's use of humor is easily the best of any film in the MCU. That's not to say it's just the funniest (Though it most likely is the funniest MCU film as well), but the humor actually services the story and the characters here in a way that's been largely unrealized outside of Gunn's Guardians films. Moments like Thor becoming a lazy, unsubstantial Xbox Live troll or Hulk becoming a mild-mannered, affably dorky goofball don't exist merely for memes and throwaway gags, they're genuine pushes to flesh out and develop these characters, showing how these diverse personalities each react to the tragedy of failure and deep personal loss in their own ways. We laugh at their hijinks the same way we can look back at our own tragic experiences with darker, reflective comedy. The humor is deceptively smarter than it was in previous MCU films and it services the story rather than having the story serve the humor, throwing childish things aside while still honoring the spirit that these films are known for. One of the biggest reasons why Infinity War didn't work for me was because the inconsistent humor clashed so heavily with the emotional stakes of the film. Here, however, the humor compliments the stakes instead.Speaking of, the emotional power of Endgame is leagues above its contemporaries in the MCU. Characters genuinely have so much to lose here, so much to put at stake just to see their friends and loved ones alive and well again. Difficult choices have to be made here with tremendous consequences. The film feels grounded and human in a way that so many superhero films, particularly MCU films, seem to forget. It's these heroes willingness to sacrifice so much, and the film's strict adherence to establishing the enormous depth of their gambles, that makes them so heroic, and in turn makes this possibly the best superhero film to date. Heroes are not tested by their victories, but by their failures and their ability to rise above and grow from them. Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Black Widow and Hawkeye are forced to give nothing less than everything for the very hope of a better tomorrow and they don't all make it back unscathed. Some don't make it back at all, and their sacrifices are very much ultimate. Avengers: Endgame is about as inspiring and uplifting a superhero film as the genre's finest and fully captures what makes its comic book paragons so beloved by readers across the glove.Endgame's characterization of Thanos is vastly improved this time around as well. Thanos' refusal to accept the possibility of failure, even in an alternate timeline, and his abandonment of an ethical highground upon the mere possibility of defeat not only creates a fascinating parallel with The Avengers, it completely shatters the argument of Thanos as a sympathetic figure with noble ends. He's a child wielding power he lacks both the respect and the fortitude for, a sore loser who can't see past his own narrow, close minded vision. The Russo brothers clearly predicted the misguided internet following that Thanos and his absurd ideology would gather and Thanos' characterization in Endgame represents a thorough dismantling of his unearned positive reputation.The direction here is absolutely top notch. The choreography, editing and camera work behind the action scenes is absolutely outstanding; from the tracking shot of Ronin taking out Yakuza in Japan to the epic, apocalyptically scaled final battle with Thanos himself. Avengers: Endgame doesn't just feel epic and exhilarating, it absolutely earns those emotions. It feels like a massive scale event and a filmmaking experience in a way that I never thought possible for this franchise, while still never losing sight of the more human and grounded journeys of our heroes. Even minor side characters from previous films such as Black Widow, Hawkeye and Nebula have genuinely strong arcs here; Black Widow redeeming her brutal past once and for all through the love of her friends, Hawkeye learning to respect Black Widow enough to come to terms with her tragic decisions and Nebula finding her place in the universe beyond being the pet of Thanos. That Endgame is able to take these seemingly insignificant characters and give them genuinely nuanced and three-dimensional arcs while also further developing the main Avengers cast that have been around for nearly a decade now is a true testament to just how much of a marvel (no pun intended) it is from a storytelling perspective.I can't believe I'm saying this, but believe the hype with Avengers: Endgame. It is everything I could have ever wanted it to be and so much more. It fixes problems not just with Infinity War, not just with previous MCU films like the Avengers films and Doctor Strange, but even with the comics it's based on. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer and, best of all, the film will have earned it.",positive
"I guess the headline wraps it up - what I feel about the movie, that is. With three hours and a rather good prequel it was expected to see some epic action and showdown between the good and evil characters, but yet we only get some minor action scenes and a heck of a lot of boring dialogues and stuff like that. Where is Superman when you need him? At least that would have made the movie more exciting for me. No, the movie has some moments, but it takes too long to get there, and when we do we only get a tiny bit of the action I was hoping for. Thus, with a rating of 8.8 and a throng og positive reviews I must say the movie was disappointingly bad, though not as bad as I first thought it would be after the first two hours though. If you like long dialogues and conversations between superheroes and fancy waiting for action through an entire movie then surely this is for you. If you're like me and liked Thor 3 best since it had a lot of action, then this will be better to watch on Netflix or something when you're out of options.",positive
"11 years, and still going strong, MARVEL and Disney were very much banking on audiences reacting well to to the big and very expensive climax to the Infinity Saga. And since this film became extremely close to toppling Avatar as the highest grossing film of all time, I think it's safe to say that Avengers: Endgame did so and much more.With over half the cast brutally turned to ash at the end of the equally incredible Infinity War, writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely did a superb job of wrapping up the loose ends left by Infinity War, while also wrapped up many open ended points from many other aspects of the past 22 movies. While many studios continue to try and often fail at an extensive movie universe, MARVEL has very rarely fumbled in this monstrous achievement. Despite a couple of duds, (looking at you, Incredible Hulk and Thor 2) the MCU has gone down with universal praise from fans, critics and general audiences goers alike.Nevertheless, while it's very easy to proclaim Endgame as being perfect upon first viewing, (I was admittedly guilty of that) it does have a couple of problems that can hold it back. The biggest being the inconsistent and had to understand concept of time travel. Markus and McFeely seemingly have a juxtaposing explanation compared to that of directors, Joe and Anthony Russo. Personally, I've merged both explanations, which has made re-watching the film just as enjoyable as it was at the midnight release.Additionally, some moments can be questionable, in particular one big crowd pleasing moment between the female heroes, coming together to support Captain Marvel. (Brie Larson) Ultimately, there was clear evidence that Larson's character didn't need the support. And while the moment is brilliant to watch and definitely deserves the inevitable applause it receives, the moment would be even better had Captain Marvel not been the one needing support. A very good example of what I mean can be seen in the video below.But despite some small hiccups, the majority of this narrative holds up brilliantly, and still holds up as a sublime book end for that part of the MCU's history. And while technically, Jon Watt's Spider-Man: Far From Home is the final Phase 3 film, and is technically the last film in this saga, Endgame is the big book end for the majority of it's cast, and is a tremendous and emotional send off for many of our beloved heroes.As we've come to expect from MARVEL, the production values for Endgame are off the scale, with tremendous special effects, which blends in so many elements and characters, while still appearing cohesive and a beautiful spectacle. Cinematography by Trent Opaloch was beautifully frame, full of dazzling colours at the right moments, thankfully avoiding the drab and darkly lit cinematography seen in Captain Marvel earlier in the year. Additionally, with the time travelling aspect to the narrative, Opaloch's cinematography also pays respect to the work of MCU cinematographers from past installments. Since the film was shot entirely in IMAX alongside Infinity War, some may find the standard cinemascope version (the most common version shown) to feel boxed in at times, or not framed as well. And while this can be noticeable, it doesn't hinder the film much, since everything you need to see is perfectly visible, with the IMAX versions also bringing extra detail on a larger scale. It's films like this that deserve to be shown and seen on the big-screen.Throughout the MCU's run, many aspects have improved. And the biggest improvement Endgame demonstrates is the sublime music by legendary composer, Alan Silvestri. After years of bland and unimaginative music, Silvestri really gets to be creative with this tremendous collection of music. His use of Jazz during the heist adds a unique tone to those moments, and the many inclusions of his empowering Avengers theme keeps the excitement coming. If MARVEL keeps giving composers the freedom to embrace their creativity, I look forward to continue seeing more work like this.Obviously, after 11 years of story-telling, it's hard to please everyone with what you put out, and for those audience members that somehow haven't seen Endgame or any previous MCU installment, I do highly recommend taking the journey as many fans and general audiences have done. Start at the beginning, and follow the journey. Because after completing the entire Infinity Saga (including Far From Home) I can safely say that Endgame left me dazzled, shocked, but ultimately satisfied. And even with my minor problems, it's easy to look past, and just be entertained by this thrilling adventure. What else is there to say but... Avengers Assemble!SCORES

"The complexity and dozens of meaningless characters thrown in to the sequel was unnecessary and a mess to keep up with.
In this conclusion we see our favourite main characters again and some slight twists with a decent ending. The CGI and acting great as usual, however some of the scenes are irritating in their convenience. I.e. captain America taking too much of the spotlight considering his powers.",positive
Infinity War was a million times better than this trash,negative
"Avengers: Endgame had quite a few tasks to pull off. It had to be the culmination of 21 MCU movies, it had to finish up several character arcs, it needed to deliver on what Infinity War set up, and it still had to be a good movie. It succeeded in these regards. Endgame is a thrill ride, delivering a fast-paced story, and an extremely emotional finale to one of the most ambitious franchises in movie history. Oh, and it also had to make a ton of money. Mission accomplished. Anyway, it's impossible to talk about Endgame without the spoilers, so this is a spoiler-filled review.The thing with Endgame is that it's not a movie that stands on its own. In order to appreciate Endgame to its fullest, you needed be there at least for most of the time. This is a movie primarily for fans. But it's not like it's off-limits to non-fans. It's possible to appreciate this movie as a casual fan who's only seen a few MCU movies, but it won't have the same impact as on someone who's been here every step of the way.After Thanos destroys the Infinity Stones and is beheaded by Thor, the Avengers must go back in time to retrieve the stones to bring them to the present. The time travel aspect is rather confusing, but then again, time travel across the board is confusing. The idea is that you can't change the present or future, you can only change the past. It's quite something. As far as I know, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the only movie to have time travel that makes sense. With the time travel, we get a trip down memory lane, as we see several events from the MCU unfold again, although from different angles. We get the Avengers arresting Loki, Star-Lord looking for the Power Stone, and the elevator scene from Winter Soldier recreated, although with their own twists. We also see some old friends, like the Ancient One and Frigga. All of this leads to one giant final conclusion, a grand, epic-scale battle between Thanos and his army and the completely assembled Avengers. The final battle is beyond epic and is undoubtedly the best action scene in any superhero movie, ever. This is where the epic moments happen; Cap lifts Mjolnir and says ""Avengers, assemble,"" much to the joy of audiences everywhere. Some may complain that it's fanservice, but it's not. It's the natural progression of the story that they've been telling since 2012. They teased Cap with Mjolnir in Age of Ultron, and the moment was worth the wait. And with the constant addition of new heroes, having them come together for the final battle was the optimal way to cap off 21 movies.As far as the spoilers go, there are several. The big one, of course, is the death of Tony Stark. He dies using the stones to take down Thanos. Having watched this character develop since 2008, going from a cocky billionaire to the guy who'll do anything for his family and planet, it was sad to see him go, but at least he died heroically. And in this movie, Tony's arc is interesting because he found happiness, even after the snap. By coming back to the battle, he gives up everything he gained in those 5 years and makes his sacrifice at the end all the more selfless. Plus, everyone thought Cap was going to be the one to die. Speaking of Cap, there's what happened to him. He stays in the past to live with Peggy Carter. Given everything Cap went through over the years, it was a well-deserved victory, and a happy way to end the movie. It's a very bittersweet ending, kind of like Lord of the Rings. On one hand, Thanos is defeated, Cap got to live a happy life, but on the other, Tony Stark is dead and this grand story we've been following for so long is over. It's very emotional, especially for those of us who have been here for years. One spoiler that's kind of odd was Black Widow dying. On one hand, someone had to die at Vormir, as they can't not get the Soul Stone. On the other hand, it felt forced. At least we see how upset Hawkeye and the other Avengers are, so they at least recognize her sacrifice. And, of course, she did sacrifice herself to save the universe, which is, obviously, heroic. But since the movie moves at a rapid pace, it does feel rather rushed.Another aspect of this movie is how it finishes a 22-movie arc, that started way back in 2008. With that in mind, it's the end of an era, but it doesn't jump right in to the next. People were speculating about how things would be after Endgame, but we hardly know. People said Captain Marvel would be leading the Avengers. We don't know. It respects the old characters and doesn't shove them aside for the sake of the new ones. Heck, you're probably fine watching Endgame if you haven't seen Captain Marvel yet. That's not to say it ignores the new characters. The Captain Marvel vs Thanos fight is pretty cool. That leads to another aspect: no one in this movie feels useless. In Civil War, for instance, they could have reached that outcome without Spidey or Ant-Man. Here, everyone plays a part, and every snap survivor did something that led to the conclusion.With that in mind, this movie marks the beginning of a new phase in the MCU, and a new chapter for our heroes. Of course, Iron Man died, Black Widow died, and Cap is old now, as established, but Thor's arc is interesting. He does fall on hard times, but he does come back. Because he's Thor. He rises above his giving up phase and rediscovers himself. Oh, but shame on them for the Fortnite joke. That was disgraceful. Having Thor join the Guardians of the Galaxy was an interesting twist, but I'm not sure where that'll end up. I also have no idea what'll happen with Valkyrie and the Asgardians in Norway. But at least it leaves us interested. It doesn't jump right in to Phase 4. The other character with a shift is Thanos. There are two Thanos's. The one that dies 20 minutes into the movie, and 2014 Thanos. He shifts from balancing the universe to starting the universe over, which isn't as interesting as before, but it definitely raises the stakes. Nebula also has quite the interesting arc. While she doesn't undo the snap in this version, having both versions of her, one seeking Thanos' approval and the other to kill him, is an interesting contrast.Despite the impressive runtime, it doesn't feel that long. Heck, this movie is longer than Fellowship of the Ring, but doesn't feel any longer than Infinity War. This is, of course, due to how fast the movie moves, juggling the post-snap world, all 3 time travel quests, Thanos, and everything else. Most impressively, it's never boring. It's a bit of a slow start, but when it picks up, it really picks up. It starts showing where everyone is post-snap, which it couldn't not have. It doesn't dig too much in, but we see Cap leading group-therapy, an abandoned MLB stadium, and a memorial to the snap victims, which was a neat touch as that would undoubtedly get built like that if it were to happen in real life.Avengers: Endgame is a thrilling, epic, emotional conclusion to the Infinity Saga. It's been fun to follow the story of the Infinity Stones for all these years, and it is sad to see this story end. But, as the tagline says, part of the journey is the end.",positive
Growing up with the Marvel universe may sway my opinion a bit but this is one of my favorite movies. It balances all of the characters extremely well and never gives too much screen time to one character. The plot is just the right amount of complicated and just the right amount of funny. Avengers Endgame is perfectly balanced.,positive
"I would say this is my fav marvel movie, or at least the only marvel movie I've watched so far which has given me goosebumps. The final fight scene was incredible, I don't know if it can ever be topped.The movie is 3 hours long, but it definitely did not feel that long, the pacing is very good.Surprisingly and unpopularity (I guess), I wasn't a big fan of the end after Tony died. I wasn't a big fan of Tony to start off with, he was cool but idk I didn't feel any emotion when he died, besides feeling bad for Spider-Man. I felt way more emotional when Groot died in Gotg lol.Besides that, it's very entertaining, and like I said the final fight scene is incredible, potentially one of the greatest experiences I've had with any moment in any tv show / movie ever.",positive
"Don't need to say anything else now, do I? A masterpiece.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is no doubt the best film in the galaxy. Avengers: Endgame is full of action, sadness and also thrill. I sat in a cinema for 3 hours and a half and have never enjoyed 3 hours more. It is so much better than Infinity War and I am going to see it for a second time lol...",positive
The movie is the great celebration of cinema. There is no a event so huge in the cinema history and it is a pride for the nerds of the world. I think time was not the best solution for a unsolved problem but the movie is amazing in the same way. I am really happy to be alive and see that in the theaters.,positive
"This movie forced the funny moments very bad, the end was only fan service. Just died Iron Man cause he use the gems, and Scarlett J. for sacrifice, no one slain by Thanos. Maybe was my mistake for expect a really end, but was only another marvel movie, with a happy end.",positive
"A fun movie that did not feel like it was 3 hours. It felt right how they focused it, but also good that they gave time for everyone else.
Since I knew this was the last movie for Tony stark and Steve Rogers among others, I did not feel that much when they left. I really liked that Steve and Peggy got to grow old together though.
I did not enjoy the pandering women power part of the fight. I love all those strong women, but that was so awkward.
Thor was awesome!
I hope Loki is alive. Since he changed his future by teleporting, something must have changed.
No end scene?!?
Bruce hulk was funny.
Natasha got a great ending.
Gamora!",positive
"Marvel hired some writers to find a way to bring most the casts together. We all knew some would be killed off, the older ones at least while some would survive because their contract said so.The story was rather vague and not much logic, even factoring in all the Marvels techno stuff, and did not impress me much.The final battle? No regular human forces (police, army, marines etc,) were involved? Did Thanos killed them all in the last movie at the snap of his fingers? The time travel logic did not make sense either but I did laugh at the quotes of old time travel movies.The movie will make money but I rather watch Iron Man 1, Thor 1 and Avenger 1 over this. IMO Superman could had killed Thanos without trouble only if the studios would allow it.",positive
"As always this movie had great acting and special effects.
I went to the theatre with my friends, sat down with some chips and coke and started watching...
Then the movie started it had some suspense at the beginning, then fifteen minutes in, I realised that this movie was more bland than a dish on Kitchen Nightmares, mediocre at best. The only fresh and fun thing was fat Thor.
Then the final battle came, and my disappointment continued, the whole MCU came to defend The world against Thanos and his army. And the disappointment continued. Suddenly Capitan America became wordy of Thor's hammer, Capitan Marvel turned into a lesbian, for some reason, Iron man forgot to upgrade his suit, and Loki stole the Tesseract, again, and The Hulk was more useless than Italy in WWII. This movie was worse than GOT season 8!
Worse 10 euros ever spend!",negative
Was everything I expected and more! Awesome movie.,positive
This movie is the best movie ever made and most epic! Cannot describe it better! A must watch 3000 times!,positive
"Nearly perfect in every way, Endgame justifies it's 3 hour run time with incredible character moments, epic scenes, and satisfying character write offs. The perfect extension of Infinity War...A five a half hour epic between the two films that I believe many will go back and watch time and time again. The only flaw I had was a bit of a slow pace in the beginning and some jokes that didn't land. Will Definitely be seeing multiple times!",positive
"This movie is perfect, it perfectly wraps up the avengers storyline..... it didnt feel like a 10/10 at first but thats because i was used to the typical avengers/marvel movie chain of events. but after looking back on it it was PERFECTLY laid out, the majority of the movie lacks action and fight scenes but thats what it's supposed to be like, its the last time we're going to see some of these characters on screen and they deserve a proper send-off...... but once you get to the end of the film......... that fight sequence... OH... MY... GOD",positive
"This film, to me, is damn near perfect. Yeah it has a few nitpicky things wrong with it, but it's wrapping up twenty-two films!!You're not going to see a film of this magnitude again for at least another decade!It's sweet, it's funny, it's exciting, and you can't even feel time passing. It's a thrill from beginning to end.",positive
"Great story telling with heaps of humor, make this movie very enjoyable. i think its the most enjoyable marvel movie after infinity wars. bit tears too t.t",positive
"While the film isn't perfect I couldn't help but pump my fist and squirm in my chair at every moment. It's so exhilarating and exciting. I do agree that the time travel in the film does not obey its own rules at all, it still supplies the viewer with tons of fan service that they will remember for years to come.
I left the movie satisfied with what I saw, a perfect finale to many characters story's.",positive
"In 2008, I was intrigued with what Marvel was planning out after seeing the first Iron Man and its post-credit scene explaining of a wider universe. Now to the present time with the MCU's latest installment Avengers: Endgame - all the heroes and allies we've come to know culminating from 22 MCU movies - leads to an end of a magnificent saga. I did not expect it to be so engaging and downright fun! Joe and Anthony Russo did a splendid job setting up this climactic film. Stars Robert Downey Jr, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, and Scarlett Johansson gave it their all with performances that made their characters as humorous, clever, or just plain deep. What a run alongside the additional familiar faces in this all-star cast. No words can express how much I enjoyed out of this 3-hour spectacle.Three weeks have passed since Infinity War. The Mad Titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) has successfully decimated half the Earth's population with a single snap and the surviving Avengers along with their few remaining allies must find their resolve by setting things right.My curiosity and adrenaline kept growing with each pivotal scene playing out to either interesting cameo appearances to a shock of disbelief and dismay that I even yelped loudly when the final stand commenced. Music composer Alan Silvestri (who has done many other hit cinematic projects in the past) provided an enthralling score that accompanies and compliments the most tragic and triumphant moments of the film. Not to mention the right balance of drama and humor that felt like a roller coaster ride that toyed with my emotions. There were a few people at my local theater that quietly wept as the final act played out and that really caught my attention other than just the huge action scenes onscreen alone. The fate and great sacrifice of Tony Stark in particular, was a nail biter for me since Downey Jr's performance felt so believable as a nearly decrepit who's been through so much trauma. Saddens me The Stan Lee, nor Jack Kirby didn't live to see this spectacle that they and their associates drew and wrote on pages of paper many decades ago, but I have to say their legacies live on as these characters have cemented themselves as living and breathing entities in the world of film.I now see what both critics and audiences alike meant about how brilliant this movie can make anyone laugh, cry, or simply stay engaged. Easter eggs and cameos are also fun to find, especially if it foreshadows potential new heroes yet to be shown. Sure, this movie is not meant for everybody who are likely not into the genre, let alone comics in general. Likewise, I'll admit some scenes did feel somewhat confusing in terms of how the story builds, namely the use of time travel as a plot device was a bit difficult to follow when the rules are applied differently here compared to other past films that used it extensively. Though what matters to me is I was not at all disappointed of the end result spanning 11 years in the making.I applaud them all. Well done, well done.",positive
"To put it simply: One of THE most overrated films ever made....
I wanted it to be everything i'd hoped for, i wanted it to live up to the gargantuan hype, but unfortunately it falls short and in essence 'fails nonetheless' (to quote Thanos)
The final fight was good, but again nothing more
I do not wish to include spoilers so i'll say this:
This was not EPIC
Some people thought so
But not us

Story line is not good..lots of plot hole...Forcely added emotional scene..Good part of movie is thanos..,negative
Once again Marvel does a fantastic job bringing all these characters to the screen. The story is perfect and although the movie is 3 hours long it doesn't feel like it is. The acting is perfect. There are some beautiful scenes. The final battle is one of the best fights ever made.,positive
"Avengers: Endgame is the biggest superhero movie of all time. It is an incredible event of MCU and magnificent ending of Infinity Saga. Marvel has been doing great movies during years, as a fan I followed and watched all of them with interest. But this one, just blowed my mind. I remember my hands were shaking at final fight. No doubt, Captain America's line ""Avengers, Assemble!"" has become the most epic line in MCU and this film has become the most epic movie in MCU. Except few things, everything is clear on my mind about Endgame and it truly satisfied me. I don't want to talk so much about each character and each scene because I don't want to give any spoilers. So I just want to thank all cast, Kevin Feige, Russo Brothers, Christoper Markus and Stephen McFeely, all directors and writers in MCU films but the most importantly I want to say that Im so grateful to Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko. Thank you 3000. Thank you Marvel Studios for showing us such great stuff.Part of journey is the end.",positive
The plot twists are satisfying and got a roller coaster emotions throughout the movie. The ending is not predictable at all. Now i feel empty after watching this movie. Damn.,positive
"This movie blew me away. It kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was slow where it needed to be and fast where it needed to be. I am glad they decided to keep the run time at 3 hours, it needed it. And on run time, it flew by. There was a fair big chunk of the movie that was ""slowish"" but I do not say that in a negative way. With how infinity war left off, it had to be. The story was so good and wrapped up nicely. It was respectful to the characters and I am happy where they all ended up, as hard as it was to watch, it was still satisfying. I would be completely satisfied if this was the end of the MCU altogether, it was just so tastefully done. I need to see this again!",positive
"After the culmination of 22 films, all of everything before comes together. Did the film live up to the hype? Was it a satisfying experience? Did the film fulfill? That to me is the real question. Sure the film has flaws like every other movie and we will get to those in a minute, but that's what this review is going to try and answer, was I fulfilled? And will it potentially fulfill others? Well, let's delve into what I didn't like about this film. Firstly, there was no need for the film to be 3 hours long. There are so many scenes that could've been cut, lots of moments of exposition, and talking, some were important, some were uninteresting. This could've shaved off 30 minutes and it would have been fine. Also, there is several plot holes, and conveniences throughout, and I'm sure this happened before, but if it wasn't noticeable then, it sure is noticeable now. But that should be somewhat expected as this film crams in a 22 film plot. The first 2 hours are a bit of a drag, as there isn't much to sink my teeth into, there are some nice moments, but nothing amazing. That's as far as the negatives go, everything else is great. The last hour is perhaps the greatest hour of any superhero movie. It's epic, engaging, surprising, everything I wished the first two hours were like. The humor while not a heavy as Infinity War, is still funny, again displaying the talent of the writers for blending humor and drama. This film feels less crowded as Infinity War did, where you had 40 characters portrayed on screen, here is only 10 maybe, which allowed for more screen time with the characters, and with characters we have grown to love since 2008. The performances by each actor and actress are all top notch, but I think of all of them, the one that shined the most is Mark Ruffalo. He gave the best performance of all his appearances in the MCU thus far. Chris Hemsworth shows his more comedic side as Thor, and it feels more like the Thor in Thor: The Dark World, rather then Thor: Ragnorak. I'm a bit on the fence when it comes to the writing of the character, however. Robert Downey Jr. is the same he's always been, smarmy, snarky, and dry. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is more fleshed out, feeling she had a bigger role to play in this compared to her involvement in Infinity War. Overall, I really enjoyed this film. It's got some glaring issues for me to say I absolutely loved it, but it's a nice conclusion to this Infinity saga. One thing is for sure, this film is going to make a lot of money. I have never witnessed a film so incredibly hyped, we are going to witness history in films with all the records it's going break. If you haven't seen this already, I recommend you do, and get involved in the party. Go and enjoy!",positive
"It's well plotted and it has the right amount of laughing situations, happiness, and disappointment. I have no words.",positive
"The movie is an achievement in scale and SFX. However, the film is boring if you move one or two action pieces out. There is no stand out acting and on repeated viewings you find yourself skipping the dialogue scenes to get to action. That's a bad sign.
Infinity War was a fun movie with heart and some great scenes. This one shoehorns in Captain Marvel for the sake of screen time and makes her Silver Surfer level alpha status out of nowhere. It just doesn't fit.
The light bits all come from the time travel scenes.
Then the way they end it is just a way for Marvel/Disney to move on and fill the universe with new characters. Cap and Iron Man didn't have to go anywhere.
The truly awful part of this movie is the treatment of the Hulk. The way that was handled is a joke to any comic fan. Total wasted opportunity to let the Hulk Smash out. But instead they let Ruffalo ruin the character.",positive
Nothing will prepare you for this movie. Nothing. It's a marvel. Bring tissues.,positive
"Spoilers follow...
As somebody who has watched and enjoyed superhero movies since the first Superman movies starring Christopher Reeve, Dark Knight Trilogy, all the way to the first Avengers this movie does not live up to A-grade standards.First the good:
1. Impressive visual effects
2. Great acting by Robert Downey and the entire castThe bad:
1. The solution to their woes--time travels seems like an idea from Harry Potter rather rather than a superhero movie. Instead of what it was supposed to be ...super heroes working together to intelligently plan and execute a way to beat Thanos...against all odds....with the risk of certain death, what we have as a solution is.... to go back in time and avoid facing Thanos altogether. How unheroic! And what a convenient device to avoid solving the problem created in Infinity War! With this precedent we should not believe that any superhero can die, since it will be possible to correct any death by time travel with the effort of the flick of a switch. Didn't know being a superhero could be so easy!2. Is this supposed to be a war? How is it that we have a record number of heroes/aliens/explosions in this ""war"" and yet not a single casuality...or barely a scratch on the good side. Are these aliens totally inept? And if by some miracle any of these heroes actually dies...no problem...you can always go back in time and voila!...problem solved. By the way, the unnatural way Iron Man died does not count because Robert Downey is clearly tired of this role, and just like Harrison Ford in Force Awakens, probably just asked to be killed off abruptly. Let me bet that if Robert Downey was willing to continue, no way will they kill this money maker!So in conclusion, while this movie is supposed to be a superhero war movie, the magical use of time travel to solve all the world's ills is not the kind of short cut instant formula solution that make good movies. The fact that they have a war with no casualties on the ""good"" side confirms the bad storytelling of this very long big budget movie. Perhaps Disney can focus less on selling more toys and have a story with more realism that follows natures laws.",positive
"I feel so strongly about how bad this movie was I had to open an account on IMDB just to vent so I can get some closure on the matter. Firstly it ruined date night with the wife, usually date night ends with fun times .. but not after this .. I mean how could we ? The mood was dead, just like the plot. I loved Infinity war, so I was really looking forward to this. Half hour in I got that sinking feeling, I tried to shake it and stay positive but to no avail. I got to the point where it was so painful I made a conscious decision to rather have a sleep that to endure the dreadful plot and weak representation of our much loved hero's. We were lied to at the end of Infinity War. When Fury drops his pager and calls for Captain Marvel, we did not know she was would be accompanied by Major Disappointment. Her character was pitched to save the day but she was incapable of doing that - half the movie we did not even know where she was. As for the other characters, Thor / Hulk / Star Lord, I have no words, I don't know these people. Sigh.",negative
"Hands down, the greatest Marvel movie very made with a fantastic ending to these iconic characters. Absolutely amazing!",positive
"This is the Marvel movie I'll never forget. Trust me as I say this: this was WAY emotional than Infinity War. It is to be expected, but I haven't had this much heartbreaking experience since Logan and that's saying something. 2019 seems like the year where everything is coming to an end and there's more to come in 2020 and I can't wait to see what awaits us. Now that Iron Man's gone, we'll have to wait and see what's the future of MCU ( after Spider-Man: Far From Home comes out).",positive
Amazing & shocking. I'm so proud with Russo's jobs,positive
Avengers: Endgame turned out to be a great movie. I will say the movie did not need to be 3 hours long. But like Infinity war they manage to give every character enough screen time and every character has character development! The movie keeps you engaged the hole time and they have some of the best action shots ever especially the end battle. The movie even goes into time travel and it brings in a lot of cameo characters and doesn't get to complicated at all.The cast does an amazing job in this movie most note worthy are Robert Downey Jr who gives the most emotional scenes. Chris Hemsworth does his best performance of Thor yet. Chris Evens has more to do in this movie than the last one. Scarlett Johansson finally gets to shine as black Widow in this movie. Jeremy Renner has the most compelling story in the movie for his character. Mark Ruffalo seems to be hit or miss in this movie all depends on what you really think of him. Josh Brolin still plays the intimidating and menacing villain. And Paul Rudd nails ever seen here!Overall this has to be the best Avengers movie yet!,positive
"Many, many jokes, they wasted Hulk in this film. It's not the best Marvel movie, but it's also not the worst. It is a fun movie to spend the afternoon with the family.",positive
Literally the best movie thats exists! So much action I couldn't stop watching wow!,positive
Thanos' visit to Stark's pad. XYZ dead. How can the characters be in infinity war?,positive
"Ok, I have invested time and energy diligently watching (and enjoying) each one of the 21 Marvel Movies that lead to the culmination of the Infinity Stones Saga, over the last 10 years.This movie really is the best cinematic experience that I have ever had. It hit every note, never disappointed and when the credits were rolling, I was already planning when to watch it next (in the cinemas), who to bring, etc.To all the folk involved in the making of it... Wow! Truly world class ✊😃😎🙏🏼",positive
"After more than ten years planning and 21 movies, Marvel studio finally released their first ten years finale. No doubt it is a great success, or maybe the greatest commercial movie success in the history. From the data of pre-book tickets box office, it is not hard to tell that how successful is this. However, back to the quality of this movie, it is also hard to make me want to rate it a high score. The biggest problem of this movie but also of the directing skills of Russo brothers is that when narrative multiple characters storylines.
*THIS PART HAVE SPOILED*
*SPOILER ALERT*
In this movie, avenger are divided into three teams to find infinity stones from the past. Each avengers have their own mission or I should say that each avengers has their own storyline. 8 avengers, nearly equal number of storylines, to tell these story right is a very difficult job. To this whole story, these stories are equal important, which means directors cannot let one or two storylines steal other's thunder. But equal importance storylines are easy to lose audience's attention. Audience will get tired when they finish digested the first two story and found out that other storylines may have the same mode. To be honest, this movie is made for fans and only fans will like this movie. In the movie, directors nearly brought back all the actors and actress that fans may want to see. Besides the surprising actors and actress, Pepper wear in the iron man suit, Captain America said ""Assemble"", finally. These element only fans will understand. So, here is the million dollars question, fans finally waited to an ending of 10 years long story, will they continue watching Marvel movie after this one? Especially, this movie almost wrap up everything and solve almost all those unsolved things. This is a huge test for Marvel studio. Are fan being loyal to the past 10 years story, actors and actresses, or Marvel Studio's brand? Btw Surftechy.com may will shutdown by the end of this month due to short of money. I will try keep this on.",positive
"I gave 3 stars because of action scene in last half hour of movie.Lets start with the beginning. avengers are trying to show emotions for first 150mins of the movie. It gets real boring real fast. Everybody is sad & useless. Guys, we get it, your friends are dead, now stop being sad and start showing some passion to avenge.
Hulk has lost its charm of being that wild, mean, funny character.
Thor has lost his planet, his people, his brother, his girlfriend, his parents and he has lost his looks with all the charm he was good for. He gave away his throne too in the end.
Thor also lost something more precious then all of this....Can you guess what? He lost his place in the Marvel universe. Wanna know how? Directors made sure Thor is not the only one who can call up the hammer when he pleases.
Can you imagine anything left for Thor in Marvel universe? I thought so...Captain America can call up Thor's hammer and use it as he pleases. This is the biggest blunder of the Marvel production. Cap has no magical power and he sure as hell is not a God of any place.
Trust me when I say this, when captain America call up the hammer by raising his arm up and hammer came to him ""All the sheeps in the theater were clapping"" . They had no idea, they got fooled right in front of their faces. LOLNow lets get to time travel. Its an idea that any Director/writer uses when they have no story, no sense, no passion, and just want to make money by fooling people. Avengers story writers were stuck and didn't know what to do.
In time travel you can do anything and change any story you want. NOT FUN AT ALL.Another blunder is that Iron-man dies while he had all the power of the universe in his hands. ""Use common sense"". How can the most powerful person in universe dies? I know how, give the story to Marvel universe and they will manage to kill that person without using any logic and people will believe it.This movie shows iron man an old white haired/bearded guy who lives In the cottage. Very weak, Anxiety filled man. where is that full of life, charming, passionate, avenging iron-man? Long gone after he got married....Marvel universe has changed the meaning of Action movie in to an Emotional movie with 2&1/2 hours of whining out of 3hrs of movie.Avengers: End game genre says its ""Action,Adventure,Fantacy,Sci-fi"" they left a Big part of movie genre ""DRAMA""
I urge the IMDB to get the genre right next time so people know what to expect.Infinity war was the best movie of Marvel and Endgame was the worst.",negative
"Avengers endgame is the best movie ever. Acting, cgi, soundrack, story everything is perfect. The final battle is my favourite scene from this movie, The first hour is a little slow but it shows the avengers planing how to defeat thanos. I cried, laughted and felt proud that i'm a marvel fan. This is the best movie in the history and i will remember it and i will tell to my children and nephews for the infinity saga. The legend Stan Lee appears in a little scene in the movie. The best movie ever. 10/10",positive
"It took me two sittings to finish, being at least 30 minutes too long.Some of the scenes were cringe worthy, but that was to satisfy the fans, not for any real reason for them to be there.There were enough interesting ideas, and nice touches of humour, to make it worth watching.",positive
"I think this is the conclusion of a decade of phenomenal MCU movies. I feel sense of emotion and pride after watching this movie. All scenes are important and I think I have to watch this movie at least three times. 😊.
I am curious about the MCU next phase.",positive
"Epic finale for Avengers series. You will see massive amount of Marvel characters and many familiar places from previous movies. Big wins and big losses.
But a bit too epic for me, liked previous part more. And the way to get Infinity Stones back is a slippery way, makes more questions than answers.Where is Loki now? Why Nebula still hangs out? EtcBest char award: Thor as a guy next door.",positive
"I love you three thousand times,when i was a student I fell in love with Iron Man.
sorry my English is not good, I can't express my feelings in words. 11 years ......Thank you.
My 11 years.
Perfect.
It's really done.
I love you three thousand times.
AVENGERS,ASSEMBLE.",positive
"Avengers endgame was in my opinion the best marvel movie to date. It was funny it was sad it had amazing action and amazing dialogue.
I also liked how Thanos wasn't in it that much because he was the main character in infinity war. Thanos had 29 minutes, Ironman had 19 and captain America had about 14 in infinity war. I think this is marvel movies at there best I HIGHLY recommend seeing it if you haven't.",positive
"The amount of plots and twist. Even with depth, like the time traveling, they did not leave any details to coincidence. With morals and inner messages like the female power.The special effect combined with real life is just terrific blended, making it not painfully to watch.The amount of plots and twisting keeping the movie interesting. Surprises after surprisesThe camera work is great, top-notch Hollywood. What is a bit of lacking is the acting of some, but overall it is very great. Also, the music choice is great Hollywood style.Some moments it is kinda stupid, like retrieving the stone by sacrifice. And the arrow.The movie have a strong line of story with some sub small stories, but it goes very shallow what makes it pity because better leave it dragging the overall quality of the movie.",positive
"I just came back from the cinema and this movie will last forever for being able to bring out together all emotions and all those incidents in 3 hours. The movie was a bit slow in the first 80-90 minutes which comedy concentrated in somehow sometimes annoying and distracting Thor dominated over which for me could have been reduced to 30-40 minutes but still I understand the details but really the comedic scenes though they were funny were distracting sometimes for me.
My scale to great endings is always harry potter and this movie really had the epic ending and very satisfying and heroic ending but still may find Harry Potter's better for some reasons. Not one of them is knowing the ending but knowing the end for some characters, also being able to predict some upcoming events in the end is a weakness in the plot which was for me the big trouble.
Captain stupid Marvel was really weak and not as powerful as I thought or even much affecting and it's for the me the strongest weakest hero in the MCU and feel like they aren't able to use her even in the end and the glove and taking the stones shot which costed the traumatic yet predictable end for some character and although had a great effect in the final battle but it felt like she is the strongest with the stupidest brain to use her powers more on the contrary my favorite one which is ""Thanos"" who was not much powerful but smart enough to beat the crap out of everybody and brought enthusiasm and all the action near the end and had one of the best fight scenes ever with Captain America, another disadvantage is that Hawkeye for me still wasn't used or made a the powerful impact I was waiting for, also the soul stone though knowing that a sacrifice is a must to earn they plan for getting all the stones and all their places in old dates and incidents but yet a huge scene was made which costed a lot for such a serious thing that they didn't agree what to do for it and the time travel matter concerning their arrival together after the missions and Nebula's delay but still arriving with them along with some points in it feels like they distracted us with the following eventful incidents.
The VFX in the film is a must Oscar winning one in the great finale battle with the camera angles and the simple score all were more than fantastic. The performances were very great and the direction for the Russo is an example for all time great direction and should be an example for powerful ones. The movie also had the great ability to create challenges and overcome them like the way it moves from extreme comedy to extreme drama and action, the scenario was also good and especially along the end with the good movie score, I also still believe the comedic part should have made the movie's genres include comedy for occupying much time in the film though it was very funny at parts and distracting at others but was too hilarious and well written. In the end again the final epic battle is an all time great scene with much enthusiasm that exceeds much of Infinity Wars' and again as a fan the movie deserves a 10/10 but for me along with stupid ass funny Thor😂 I would give it a 9.5/10 and what prevents me from giving it a 10/10 is being somehow predictable at some points regardless of what the ending was and I still hope Marvel never stops making movies like that and affecting on our characters by the characters and heroes of the great absent Stan Lee.",positive
"First, go on Amazon and get an old copy of Infinite War that came out originally in the 1990's and read it. You will be hit in the face hard that the original comic book is a far cry from what was dragged up on the screen. The original comic was far more cosmic, having many metaphysical characters in it. With Thantos not just being able to snap his fingers to win. While the movie was good and entertaining although slow to start, it was good once is got moving, kept up the roller coaster ride well. But my main problem with Marvel is that they have sold out so completely to Hollywood not thinking of their original fans at all. They have so hugely abandoned the original mythos of the comics books for a complete re-write of the Marvel Universe. Also, the Fantastic Four and the X-Men who were in the original story line were cut out completely on the movie re-make. Just is not the Marvel that I have in my comic collection. Could have been so much better.",positive
"I can only agree with Martin Scorsese. This isn't cinema. It is worse than watching a documentary.
The whole saga was drawn out for so long, with just awkward feeling movies, and a pitiful ending.
If you think this movie is good, go watch a real movie, like The Godfather or Dark Knights trilogies. If you make more than 3 movies in a franchise, the quality will be just as bad, if not worse than the Fast and Furious series.",negative
This is the greatest superhero movie I've seen in years,positive
"I've just got back from watching Endgame at a UK midnight release and I'm lost for words. This film had me laughing in hysterics and put a huge grin across my face during some unbelievable scenes. It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and made my spine tingle and then also left me in an emotional wreck. No one will be ready for what they're about to see but what a ride it was, it's up there with Infinity War, if not better as it completes the whole 22 film Infinity Saga. The Russos are amazing, everyone of their MCU films are pretty much flawless, fantastic job guys.... WE'RE IN THE ENDGAME NOW!!!!",positive
If you are Marvel fan you can watch this movie for N number of times and you will not get bored. This was perfect end of the hype and craze created by 22 movies. Every superhero had their own space to express themselves and it is beautifully managed by the directors. For Marvel fan like me it's not just a movie it's emotional send-off to some of the superheroes I admired for a decade. And non marvel fan atleast you can watch this movie for once for life time experiance.😉,positive
"I just saw Endgame today morning and at the end, as the credits rolled, I had a small lump in my throat. It was like an end of an era to all the MCU movies I had seen in the last 11 years starting from Iron Man to Captain Marvel.We have lived our lives with these characters. It just not about their names but also who they are, what they do and how different they are from each other and yet are together for a common cause - to fight the enemies of earth. These movies have made us know them as if they are our friends and well wishers.So there was a sadness when the end credits rolled as I said good bye to these friends and as Captain America says in this movie ""Life has to move on"".Coming back to the movie, hats off to the Russo brothers and the writers to ensure that this is not some revenge drama. This is not a part 2 of Infinity War. Revenge is a very small topic here and the message sent thru the movie is revenge serves no purpose at the end. It is what we can do to make this better again.I don't want to tell any more details because anyone who like me has loved the MCU movies has to see this movie. It is has all the ingredients - action, drama, emotion and comedy.The writers also spray in bits and pieces from the past movies and other MCU characters to make it interesting; it is like connecting the dots. I had fun watching those scenes because it is smart writing.The acting is outstanding and each actor gives their best shot knowing that this is the grand finale. Special mention goes to Hemsworth, Johannson, Evans and above all the man who started it Downey Jr. They take the movie to another level.Finally, is this the best film in MCU? I say No. This movie is a bit too long for its own good at 181 mins. I feel it could have been 15-20 mins shorter. Also, for me, the Iron Man (part 1), Captain America - The Winter Soldier and Civil War, Thor Raganrok and Black Panther are the best films of the MCU.However, is this a fitting finale? Yes, it is and a beautiful one. Damm, I am going to miss the Avengers !!",positive
"I always loved marvel movies and rate all of them 10/10. But these two last avengers, were so much in cliche mood.
1.After adding some new heroes, writer decided to create a bulb of losing all of those heroes that newly have got in. that was sort of believable till that at the end Nick fury also get involved, which means that they can find a way to take them back. so guessable! In previous movie, recently added heroes died, and in this movie we are going to lost some heroes which they were in all of marvel movies!
3.When Natasha and Hawk eye were searching for the stone, that was easy to guess about who will die!
All of marvel's was awesome. This one got a little lazy writings in it. I'm so sad about it also. However I'm still thinking how can I watch further movies with no more Captain America, Iron man and black widow!!",positive
"More emotional than infinity war, fight scenes still good though, writing is a little more reliant on plot devices compared to the previous film but they throw in a good amount of comedy",positive
"A personal review. I really lived up to this moment to finally see Endgame and had such high expectations. They didn't really came true though...It's absolutely worth the watch, but I think people, just like me, might be a bit disappointed.I think certain characters got way too much screentime like hawkeye and captain america, while others got way too little.
Some scenes really could be skipped, there's so much unnecessary talking and just too little action.I'm a huge Loki fan, so i really hoped he would return and would get a bigger role in this one, but elas... he is in it, luckily, but way too short. A really big missed upportunity. Of course they brought Gamora back, but no Loki.... :(
The directors just dismissed him as they have their obvious favorite characters.Thor being fat and all was funny in the beginning but later it just annoyed me. Why doing this to this great character?!Tony was great, cried my eyes out during his death scene and funeral, but the ending with cap... why give his shield to Falcon?!Many missed opportunities. The story could have been much more interesting than this obvious ending.To end positive, the special effects were amazing. You have to see this on the bigscreen.
The acting itself is also great.
So definitely worth watching, but don't expect too much ;)",positive
"Did you know there are people who don't like this movie? Weird. The culmination of a decade long, 20+ film, multi-director effort to create a cohesive cinematic universe and they pulled it off. Gripping, exciting, heart-breaking... It's an amazing work both on its own and in the scope of this massive undertaking.",positive
"While it wasn't my number one favorite of the year, ""Endgame"" is still definitely on my top ten list of this year (for now...) I found the film to be an extremely satisfying and immensely entertaining super epic that made ""Infinity War"" look like a puppet show.With all this said, I will briefly give the highs and the lows of the film:Highs: It perfectly wraps up the storyline that's been building up for 11 years to a fitting (and tear jerking) ending. All the Avengers come back in an awesome final battle that we've all been waiting for. The time travel sequences are super fun and they add a good layer of needed humor to the sad plot. The acting was incredible and the characters were used perfectly in their roles. Overall, it was easy to say that I wasn't bored at all.Lows: There, of course, is so much going on at once. Understandably, it'd be hard to do it in any other way than the way they already did, but it's honestly just a ton going on at once and it becomes pretty ridiculous. I've recently heard people complain that the new ""Hellboy"" and how ridiculously over stuffed and busy it was, but once they hear about Avengers they flock together like a bunch of monkeys because they're biased. Hulk's appearance and the fact that he could talk was very weird looking and didn't feel right. Just seeing this big green Mark Ruffalo face talking in Mark Ruffalo's voice just looked and sounded so unusual that it was kind of hard to take seriously. Last complaint, the movie was really good, it was, but why on earth is Disney making more Marvel movies at this point? Or at the very least, any more Marvel movies involving the same characters. Like, Endgame wrapped everything up so perfectly that it kinda trumps the need to make more films involving those characters. Can we just get some more new movies about characters we've never seen before (Moon Knight, anyone?) or just maybe have filmmakers adapt superhero movies that aren't from Marvel or DC (Dark Horse and Image need love too!)Just a little food for thought.",positive
"Sorry, I didn't like it. Too long, too nostalgic, too self congratulatory, too much..Given it was better than Avengers Ultron but not by much.",negative
"Without spoilers, I can't really review this movie.If you are a Marvel fan, and on every single Marvel's movie, you will probably like this movie very much. It is a continuation of avengers, of all the super heroes.I like this movie because it is packed with action from beginning to end. It also has some humors. And it is 3 hours long!I am not going to tell you what 3 heroes will be gone, but I can tell you that you may be disappointed at the end because it is not really a 100% happy ending.
That means there is no continuation story of certain heroes for sure.Before I watched this movie, I pretty much figured ""Time Travel"" is the only that can continue last movie ""Infinity war"". The time travel explains in the movie is where you can undo some of the things, and bring back lives, but couldn't really change what happen in the future. It is complicated in some way.Also, when you compare the war between Aqua-man and this movie,, at the end, this one seems to manage better with all the special effects, but basically it is another mess in the making.
Why it didn't get a 10 stars. Here is the reason why.1 Not detail in how Captain Marvel came into play. She just showed in the beginning and at the end.
2 When the good guy ""snapped"" the glove with stones, bad guys vanished and died. I just don't get it. Why would he do it? Would that repeat what it was done before ... killing 50% people on earth?
3. When one hero goes back thru the time machine and all of a sudden he became old.... that didn't explain well either...
4. Losing 3 heroes meaning less to watch in the future.",positive
"This was it, the conclusion of the infinity saga, the past 22 films, and setting up the future for a new generation of the mcu. This film really did give fans what they wanted, and the way the movies ties EVERYTHING together from all the movies was beautiful. I've seen a lot of other reviews saying how the time travel and Thor stuff were problems but honestly I understand it completely. Thor lost everything, his brother, best friend, mother, father, Asgard, everything. On top of that he failed to stop thanos in infinity war, and his guilt carries on in this film. A lot of people hated the direction Thor went in this movie, and I wasn't a fan either, but I understand why. As for the time travel, it does create a lot of plot holes, but nonetheless the movie was touching and brought the mcu full circle. The last battle where EVERYONE came through to fight thanos and his army was beautiful. The art behind this scene was amazing. It showed the mcu as a whole and what it really is, and then tony, the one who started it all, also ended it all and made the ultimate heroic sacrifice so the marvel cinematic universe would live on. It's poetic how this movie ends, it really does conclude the last chapter of the mcu, and it sets up the new one beautifully. Iron man being the one to save the universe was touching and perfect. Of course this move was flawed, but it definitely did justice to fans and the mcu. I'm exited for what's in store next.",positive
"Boy was I glad to watch in the cinema on a first watch. The three hours flew by and literally felt like an hour and a half. It was everything I wanted and it was all for that last scene. Seeing Thanos being triumphed over was so satisfying, especially considering some of the awful Marvel has pumped out in previous years. The emotions were high when all of the returned heroes came back to join Ironman, Captain America and Thor. The moment had been built up for so long and it was so rewarding to see it come through.Is this movie the best movie ever? No. Does it have some big plot holes or over the top exaggerations? Yes. Time travel, Thor holding open and sustaining the blast of a sun, and the return of Gomorah and the fact that Nebula doesn't cease to exist when she shoots her past self in the head, just to name a few.But where it has flaws it has such strong highs they definitely overshadow them, including Ironmans ultimate sacrifice, making him in my opinion the best Avenger.This movie was one of my most memorable experiences in a theatre. It was so entertaining and needs to be what movies at the theatre are all about, people turning up in the masses, it was good to see people still really value going to the theatre and getting an experience that streaming at home cant offer. This was hopefully one of many more opportunities to see something on this grand scale in the theatre.Upon watching it a second time it's not as good, especially out of the movies. The plot holes stand out a bit more and are harder to excuse and it definitely didnt feel like an hour and a half this time.But still one of my favourite movies and definitely in my top 10. If you didnt see it in the movies it's still good but I think you missed your chance.",positive
"A spectacular culmination that is in many ways better than previous instalments. Endgame can be surprising, nostalgic, touching, there's better character development, it's not afraid to be self-ironic and changes style and pace. The first third is rather intimate, the second is more relaxed and the finale is grandiose action inferno. However, all these parts fit together pretty nicely. Sure, there are weaker moments and many things can be justifiably criticized (fan-service, plot holes, sometimes slow pacing etc.) But those are just small (and expected) negatives when compared to the huge scope of Marvel's cinematic universe that was build up over entire decade.My hat's off to you, Marvel, you're an indisputable pop-culture phenomenon.",positive
"Saw this in theatre. Best theater movie I have seen together with the "" Gladiator"" and "" Avatar"". Thanos lines give me the chill.
Great characters and movie! 10 out of ten!",positive
"For me Avengers Infinity War was perfect marvel movie. this one was ok, not great not fantastic, it's just ok. it would be great if they didnt force too much comedie into the movie where half of population went missing and it was normal that we have a kind of drama/action movie and not another comdie action (when you see thor and hulk you will know what I'm talking about). it's ok ending. captain marvel arrival feels like GoT night king lifting dead dragon with chains in the middle of nowhere and nothing.I hope there will be some another edition, where they cut it all stupid, not funny scenes and present real dramatic through whole movie, and not only last half of hour",positive
"I think it wasn't as well as Infinity War but definitely that was better than Avengers 1 & 2 especially Age of Ultron!This movie could be just 2hrs but last to 3hrs which make it some boring in somehow but it has some good funny jokes and critics about ""Time machine movies"" such as ""Back to the Future"" but in my opinion wasn't appeared better than most of them!Btw evoke the atmosphere of ""Big Lebowski"" with thor's wearing which was very funny!!However I think this movie want to develop feminism thoughts by making some hero women very very powerful especially Carol Danvers/ Captain Marvel and we can see that effects in the war too which all hero women assembled and try to fight all together which was very ridiculous in war!!!",positive
"So its all come down to this. I had my hunches on what was going to transpire. Some of it was correct but it was delivered well. In fact, really well. The film is long, too long. However, I rarely clock watched despite a feeling of being quite slow early on. It has an epic start and finish although the middle feels different to the usual. Thats not a bad thing. Im not the biggest superhero movie fan, I'm a little tired of the overused formulas. I think its a miracle they made this work having all superheros together at once, they did well. Overall though I cant escape the feeling of unevenness and feeling cheated by some of the abilities of the superheroes which do not feel even or equal out fairly on screen. Theres little feeling of tension as a result or dread. I didn't care for the characters enough in comparison to say the Dark Knight Trilogy. Its a good movie, no doubt about it but not sure its worth its absolute plaudits.",positive
"You had to do it This way?? I mean there wasn't any other options? I'm a crazy marvel fan, I die for any superhero movies, madly in love with avengers, but this ending ( which is literally the ending) p****d me off!
Ok first, why time travelling? It's soo lame and an old idea.
I'm so pissed off that I can't even for a second say a good thing about this movie, because of all the disappointments.
You really had to make Thor fat? Yeah we laughed a bit at first but that's it. They literally destroyed his god-ness,badassness, the greatest image. Dude, he was a damn god that everyone in theatre cheered for when landed on Earth in infinity war! And they changed him with a homeless guy. Very godly! And captain picks up his hammer (yeah he is also worthy (long live America), so they should have killed this pathetic person. Free him of his misery).The idea of hulk being able to take control of the other guy is ok (even though cliche), but if they can co-exists then bring him when needed!!!!!! Don't be like a stupid happy, calm person who just did yoga. What's the point??!You had to kill iron man? Of course it's a great ending and everyone will cry, every fan will say ' I love you 3000', but was it necessary? He literally was the only avengers ( other than hawk-eye, but seriously compare to others, no one cares for him)who had something to care, to lose, to love. He was happy. It's like they really wanted to make people emotional and cry, so let's kill the beloved arrogant, funny one. I mean Thor has nothing to lose, Natasha, Hulk, even Captain America. But no, kill iron man.Some scenes were meant to be epic, have meanings but ended up being too forced and unreal. Like the ""girls-power, femenism"" scene. Yeah all the women are there, it was too forced.
And the end of Captain America, he just decided to stay, and it was accepted! We can just forget the time travelling problems with that! But why? Because they wanted to make a happy ending for him. And he gave his shield to a black guy? Just again to satisfy some other viewers. It is so forced.I really don't care if no one agrees, obviously many says it's 10/10. And it is impossible to satisfy everyone.
actually I'm jealous of those who were satisfied. I wish I was too.",positive
Ok. So. Endgame yaaay I am hyped goes to watch starts getting impatient. The pace was wayyyy tooo slow. Maybe this is because it is last movie of Phase 3? The movie was slow paced and then at the end everything rushed. IMO Infinith War was wayy better. I think it shouldve been half of the time length of the 3h.,negative
"This movie is literally perfect, from the soundtrack to the editing, the acting especially, everything is amazing. I honestly didn't know I could love a movie so much! I cried at least twice, and it has the best fight scene in marvel history. No spoilers, but the ending will leave you feeling satisfied, like you've just watched the end of an era. Truly a fantastic era. Thank you Stan.",positive
"Endgame is an epic conclusion to the Infinity Saga. It may have issues with some of its characters, and there are a few plot holes here and there. And the final battle could've been more planned out better instead of them clashing with one another. But this movie is a grand and monumental moment in film history, with multiple movies building up to here. This movie has excellent individual character moments, especially for the primary six avengers. The movie has outstanding callbacks to previous films. This movie has a fantastic range of emotions that you will feel. This movie is far from perfect, but this movie is made for fans of the MCU, and if you are a fan, you will have a fantastic time. This movie is a satisfying end to the Infinity Saga and a few of our beloved characters.",positive
"This is one of the best films I've ever watched. Marvel always know how to make a good film, it's a cinematic masterpiece. I think it may have been one of the best movies of this error. The ending has me upset everytime I think about it and also everyone dying made me so upset like I cry every time I watch it and I could never get bored. Although it was the end of the Eire, apparently there was 22 movies in it, The ending made it worth it although probably never wanted it to end like that. Stan Lee but probably be so impressed with the ending but sadly she died so rest in peace Stanley",positive
Why don't I give this a ten? Simple everything about this movie is perfect except that nobody says Excelsior or that it doesn't say Rip Stan Lee or something. They should have done something in honour of him. But apart from that this is just pure art,positive
"It has been 11 years since the debut of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The surprise hit and excellent movie, Iron Man, paved way for one of if not the best movie franchises ever conceived. It has been a total of 21 films (some better than others but all consistently good) with many great characters, plot twists and turns. Now, to see it finally come to an end with Avengers Endgame was exciting.Avengers Endgame is directed by the now famous Russo Brothers. This duo were the ones responsible for the brilliant Captain America The Winter Soldier and Civil War as well the previous Avengers movie, Infinite War. They have done a great job with each movie and have done an incredible job of bringing and end to the MCU as we know it with Endgame.Endgame first takes place in the near future with the Avengers all demoralised after their brutal loss to Thanos. Their loss results in not just the loss of 50% of the civilised universe, but every animal that lives in it. The result is an empty self destructive Earth full of people struggling to deal with the immense loss that each and every person has suffered. Because of this pain, the Avengers decide to take the fight to Thanos and the result amounts to nothing, just more loss. After an extended period of time, we see that each hero has been struggling to deal with the loss in their own way, they come together to follow through a plan to undo what has happened. The result is an interesting ambitious story, one that I will not spoil here.I will say that the plan the Avengers sets in motion is quite different for the MCU and was very ambitious for a film of this magnitude. It handles the subject very differently from others out there and can be a bit hard to follow for some. Either way, it leads to a lot of great action set pieces and many call backs to previous films. We see a lot of great characters return, it should make fans of the MCU very happy.In terms of acting, this is about as good as it can be. Chris Hemsworth's Thor is still emotionally destroyed after the events of Ragnarok and he does a great job of portraying it. Chris Evans is great as the always plucky Captain America and Robert Downey Jr. without a doubt sets the bar incredibly high. He has moments in this film which I would consider his best work, period. No questions asked. He delivers like no other in Endgame and his acting will no doubt pluck at those heart strings. The biggest surprise of the lot is Jeremy Brenner as Clint (Hawkeye). Not only does he go from supporting character up to a heavy lead role, he absolutely delivers. His story arc is one of the more entertaining and darkest. He's a great actor with a great character, one that deserved to shine so bright after all these years.There's a lot of humour in the film. Those that liked the humour in Thor Ragnarok will be very happy here. It helps keep the tone of the film from being too bleak and depressing. There are moments in the film which are just laugh out loud funny. There are others which are quite subtle, like the infamous ""Deep Fried Kebab"" sign in Infinite War, which was good fun. Be prepared for a lot of swear words, if that is something you don't like or don't want your kids hearing. Obviously with the frustrations of the hero's, they bark out some naughty words as most adults do. It's otherwise fairly suitable for kids and certainly a film that would have blown my mind as a little one.For such a brilliant film its not quite a 10/10 film. I didn't like the way Captain Marvel was used in the film. She just appears in the movie without an introduction or explanation. She literally just turns up looking smug and it amounts to very little. She's there ten minutes tops at the start and then doesn't show up until the end. It takes a little focus off of the original team, who this movie should be and isOverall, I do think this is better than Avengers Infinite War and is definitely a good two part movie, it's definitely one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. I loved every so much of it and it really didn't feel like 3 hours. The movie had its deep emotional moments, it had its laugh out funny moments and had so many great action scenes. This is a superb film. Both directors deserve a lot of credit for pulling off a project of this magnitude with such success and is mightly impressive. If you've enjoyable any of the previous MCU films, you'll likely enjoy this.",positive
The perfect way to end this saga that started a decade ago. This will be hard to bet moving forward for the MCU as the case and the story meant so much for so many.,positive
"Super hyped and still entertained but felt underwhelmed and disappointed. Yet, the writings were on the wall with Cpt Marvel. Nonetheless go watch as this will be the last MCU with still a bit of quality. It is obvious which direction future Marvel films will take and it will not be good. Rest In Peace MCU.",positive
The most impactful movie in the entire MCU! Going to see it again and will be just as amazing as watching it the first time. It's a tear jerker for sure but plenty of humorous scenes that don't dilute the serious ones. Thank you Marvel and Disney!,positive
"It was good but mainly because of the humour and a few key moments. There were a lot of parts I did enjoy but also a lot that I didn't. Fat Thor was hilarious, but I also hate how they kind of ruined Thor. Come on..... like Thor is a god!!! In the first Thor, he eats like a pig (in the diner) and is still hungry. After battle, they pig out at banquets and get drunk. Yet Thor is always buff and ripped.... why?... because he is Thor!!!!! A GOD! Can he even put on weight? It was still hilarious to see Thor fat but when I saw it in trailers and stuff prior I thought it was a bonus scene as a joke..... not in the actual movie!! So that was disappointing. In my opinion they totally ruined the character. Tony Stark was cool. Captain America they really fleshed out which was good. Ant Man was great and funny. The Hulk they kind of ruined as well but he had a lot of funny moments. Honestly, Disney really seems to be taking the SJW approach to most things which really just ruins it because it is so blatantly obvious. In addition to making a lot of the men either overweight chumps or just really wimpy. It is just getting a bit tiresome because it is like this in every Disney movie now and its becoming so predictable. I liked Jeremy Renners character and how they brought more depth to Hawkeye. I thought Bucky should have been the next Cap and not Anthony Mackie. I guess they have to find a way to give Falcon super strength. Captain Marvel is still lame. No personality and so overpowered it is just dumb. Scarlett Johansen was really good. Still shocked they actually killed her off to be honest. I liked the Scarlet Witch. That fight scene was really cool. Doctor Strange is still awesome haha. I liked how the sorcerers used their powers at the end to save everybody from the missiles. Nebula played a huge role in the movie which I was not expecting. I like that actress a lot. She is really beautiful and I liked her in Jumanji so it was nice to see more of her in Endgame. I am pretty excited for the next Gaurdians movie if Thor is in it. Hopefully, he loses weight and becomes Thor again....... because the whole fat Thor thing, while hilarious!... really ruined the character in my personal opinion.The movie was still really fun. However, I am more excited for all the individual movies now because they honestly do a better job of showcasing the characters. Endgame was really kind of all over the place, focused a lot on humour, and while doing some of the characters huge favours..... it really ruined quite a few of them for me.Still excited for the rest of the MCU and I hope Sony and Disney can sort it out because the new Spider-Man franchise is really good.",positive
It was entertaining but the only action was towards the end drawn out at the beginning but the ending killed the movie for me I prefer something that leaves viewer something that's uplifted they killed off my favorite characters,negative
Avengers endgame is like a 3 hours roller coaster ride which will make you laugh and make you cry. At some moments you will be speechless and at some moments you will not be able to stop yourself shouting. And at the end you will be happy to be the part of this 3 hours journey.,positive
"Endgame was certainly the end of an amazing saga. Epic, touching, funny, sad. It has a little of everything. True - it's overly long, but if you are a fan of ANY of the characters, you really didn't want it to end. Beautifully done, Disney. You have my complete respect. You took something that could have been a few cheesy kid movies and made them enjoyable for most ages and ended it with great reflection. You hired great actors, writers, directors and made brilliant products - Bravo!",positive
This movie is really nice.this movie has both emotional and funny moments.The most emotional scene was when ironman died and black widow as well.I love you 3000,positive
"This is an emotional roller coaster that honors in a superb way the last 10 years of Marvel movies. It's a perfect conclusion to an era. It's 3 hours long but it feels like 1. It all happens so fast. I was on the verge of tears like 5 or 6 times. The dilemma Tony faces throughout the movie is very well executed. The characters, although many, have enough things to do during the movie. It's non-stop action and it never gets slow. The script has, naturally, the advantage of dealing with characters (and a situation) we already know and love, and that are well defined, but creates something new with it all. It's been an incredible journey. And a part of the journey, is the end.",positive
"Marvel universe has been giving us a lot of amazing movies since 2008 (iron man) . Endgame was a perfect movie to end the Era. It is a awesome crucible of drama , action , emotions , pain and what not ... enjoyed the movie a lot. I already watched this movie over 4 times and still cant get over it .",positive
"It's a masterpiece! Fight, acting, storyline , everything perfect.",positive
Went in with very high expectation because of IW (I watched IW 3 times) and the inclusion of Capt Marvel (didn't like the movie thou). It got some good moments (milking the sadness of defeat) and some clever and inspirational lines (which I think is very important for superhero movies that mcu a bit lacking). Sometimes the jokes came in the way of the emotional moments thou. Felt a bit uneven overall. Hope for so much more from Capt Marvel but ... And bit sad looking at Hulk and Thor become victim of plot. It's quite a mixed feeling movie for me. Just an ok I guess?,positive
"Avengers: Endgame, the culmination of twenty plus movies and the follow up to Infinity War. It should be noted that this will not be the end of the MCU franchise as a whole; of course not. It is the grand finale of the Infinity Stones saga. Five years after the events of the previous film, when Thanos succeeded at wiping out half of all life in the universe, the situation is utterly hopeless. Memorials are made as a feeble attempt by the survivors to remember those that had disappeared, and while it is true that things are looking up, such as with whales returning due to the lack of ships, keep in mind that the Snap wiped out half of ALL life in the universe, so that whole thing with the whales is less optimistic especially if they were in danger of dying out before Thanos halved them. However, when the idea of time travel rears its head, it opens the door for the remaining Avengers that maybe they could undo what the Mad Titan had done.The film was surprisingly moving, not to say that any of the MCU films could never be emotional. Even though society tried to continue onward after the Snap, it proves more difficult because they have to try to move on with the knowledge that their friends and loved ones are gone. The remaining heroes also have their own struggles with having to cope with the fact that they lost. But they are also shown to be completely willing to do ""whatever it takes"" to undo the Mad Titan's destruction, even if it may cost them dearly.
As for anything else, the action was great as is often the case when it comes to these films, but the third act in particular was probably the best part of the film IMO. How they pulled it off is incredible to say the least. Acting was good for the most part, and many lingering plot threads in the film series and character arcs were fulfilled here.The only negatives I can think of is how time travel was implemented in the film. While many guessed that time travel would play a key role in the film due to behind the scene footage of the film, there are times when the logic with how time travel is done in the film gets problematic. Additionally, Chris Hemsworth functions as the comic relief in the film. But, I felt that the recurring jokes surrounding him were a little tired and shortly got irritating. And for all the talk that Marvel did in regards to Captain Marvel, she did not even appear that much in the film. She does appear in two pivotal moments, but is otherwise preoccupied. To me, it sounds as though there were more scenes dedicated to her but were likely scrapped from the final product.
Otherwise, greatly enjoyed the film, and I feel that it is a great send off to the Infinity Stones arc. With July comes Spider-Man: Far From Home, which will overall conclude the fourth phase of the MCU. Can't wait to see what else is in store.",positive

"SYNOPSIS:
It's Avengers. You know this.REVIEW:
I'll keep this one brief as it's Avengers: Endgame and I don't there's much to say that hasn't been said. Since this is in my Top 10 of 2019, I do want to get a review out for it.This culmination of 23 films was done beautifully. The task that the Russo brother had was absolutely no easy feat. You can say the time-travel aspect was confusing and I know some people really disliked the route they took with Thor and Hulk, but at the end of the day they tried things out. This easily could've been fan service from beginning to end and have a bland storyline if they set out to find Thanos (which they obviously will) and defeat him. Would I still love it? Sure. However, when they at least try to conclude this era of the MCU with creativity I think that adds a lot to the sentiment. You clearly have two directors who are pouring their hearts out for the fans while making an entertaining story that's not just fan service for the sake of fan service. For myself, yes it dragged at times, but it's one of those films that I wouldn't take anything out because everything is sewn in a particular way to the overall story. Having seen the movie 4 times I actually understand what they were going for. It's a bit too much to explain my understanding here, but I think if you watch it and just listen to what Banner says that you might understand it too. Now, something that they imply at the end definitely doesn't add up to how they explained their time-travel, but they had so much to work with that I don't think it's fair to nit-pick everything as I truly believe no one could've made an absolute perfect ending of this capacity. I love Stark ultimately making the selfless act and Cap making the selfish act when throughout all of the other films it was reversed. That really brought everything full circle and put a gigantic smile on my face. I appreciate this film so much and I really appreciate the Russo Brothers for putting in the work they did and the passion really shows. 8.7/10.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is less of a movie and more of an event. It celebrates 11 years of superhero cinema while also commemorating itself as just a huge, huge event. As something like this, it works very well. As a movie, on the other hand, there are severe flaws.Now that isn't to say that I hate Avengers: Endgame- in fact, I really enjoyed the film. However, as genuinely enjoyable as the second half is, the first half is slow-paced, lifeless, and drags on. Sure, that's the intention given the fact that half of life only remains, but that doesn't aid in the fact that it still feels a bit long and disjointed at times. It doesn't quite have a flowing narrative or genuine structure, it just plays out as a series of overemotional filler.The second half (and the time travel scenes), on the other hand, is immensely fun and entertaining. I'm not here to talk time-travel mumbo jumbo so I'm gonna be ignoring those flaws, The climax and the aftermath of it are both incredible and really give the film its identity; a huge, grand-scale spectacle of a film and a sight to behold.In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is a far from perfect movie, but it's still solid and delivers a spectacular ending for not just itself, but for the MCU. It will go down as a classic, that's for sure, but for now, the MCU is a story of a lifetime.Rating: A-",positive
"When I said Endgame was silly, I was referring to the science part. Yeah I know it's what people would call ""Pseudo-Science"" and the movie caught in a science-fiction genre, but still, bringing time travel theme (or rather, as Scott Lang put it, ""Time Heist"") to a movie, even if it's a sci-fi one, possess a great risk of making the movie a little bit (or maybe much) nonsensical that still got me thinking in my confusion up until now, like ""wait, how's that happened?"" ""If this happened, shouldn't that never had happened?"" ""How can compressing yourself into a thing smaller than an atom so can get you travel back to the past?"" and so on, and so on.Maybe if I'm not a science (and science fiction) enthusiast, who enjoys reading and finding out things like black holes, wormholes (Einstein-Rosen bridge), the Big Bang, Neutron Stars, etc I would have enjoyed the movie more. So I decided to do a different thing: make it as sensible as possible. And you know what I got from that? A decent superhero movie. A lot of people says it's great, the greatest superhero movie even, but I'm sorry, to me it's just good. And that's enough. it's boring at first up until the third act, in which the most intense action scene takes place, it has memorable, jaw-dropping, heart-pumping, touching, heart-warming, tear-jerking scenes along the way until the credit finally rolls at almost the third hour of the entire duration of the movie.I think Endgame is kind of a movie that I will actually enjoy several days after I watched it by re-watching some of the cool scenes form the leaked footage in Youtube (yeah they're literally everywhere in that video-sharing platform, that's how crazy the fans are). And I need to admit, maybe I miss some of the things that made people enjoy it far more than I did. I dunno, maybe I'm gonna watch it again on the theater, something that I have never did before for any movie, no matter how great it is.",positive
"This movie definitely does not deserve a better rating than Avengers 2012. Endgame is just too self indulgent and cutesy at times. Don't get me wrong, most series would have suffered much worse artistically under the weight of success, it's just not better than the original. At all.",positive
Some smart creative choices were made in this movie. Thanos is great. Captures the spirit of superhero crossover genre.,positive
"Endgame is a fun,action packed blockbuster that concludes many arcs but although it's enjoyable there are moments that were predictable but overall I liked it. I'm going to give Avengers:Endgame an 8.5/10.",positive
"Well, I am impressed and honoured to be part of this family. This people getting together to watch and live the epic climax of such a vast and heroic universe. Beacause this film is all about this. About a huge family getting together to fight and save the world. It is not a movie. It is not just a movie. It is in a way a phenomenon, which moves every fan and fills their hearts-our hearts- with enthuisasm, joy and a sense of pride to be a member of this extermely big event.The film as a film is also one of great value. The conversations between the characters are funny and well-written, the big stars get a nice amount of character developement, most of the plot points feel natural and logical to happen and the final battle is jaw-dropping. The audience experieneces a variey of emotions till the last act- where pathos and amazement are the majror emotions. Great characters, awosome moments, a satisfying fan service and a mixture of emotions.And although I am not a big fan of MARVEL or superhero films, I actually have to admit that this ""event"" was something huge and important for cinema. And yes, ""artists"" will avoid it and some will find it silly and childish, but I can assure you that this film has a heart and it is like a big, colourful, noisy parade.Ok, it has its flaws. The first quarter feels ""off"", some of the humour and of the references are too much there is a feministic scene alsmost every Marvel superhero woman is there and it feels cheasy, a little bit of shaky camera, but...We have characters, epicness, long-shots, a solid soundtrack and a great amount of emotions. And we also learn that whatever happens, good or bad, we will fight it... together.What a day.8/10 go experience it with lots of friends and in front of a big screen",positive

"I don't understand why so many suddenly get bent out of shape with all of the time travel problems and paradox issues with this. Holy Cow, you could have carved up 'Terminator' back in 1984 with this kinda stuff...but uh, why? It's a movie!So, ignore all of the pseudo-scientists and enjoy the movie.It's great, by the way. The acting is actually very good.I had a few issues, but nothing to get in a twist about...I think they should have had Gamora and Nebula a little more involved in Thanos' demise. They made it look like that was going to happen, and then it just kinda didn't.As powerful as Captain Marvel is, they should have just kept her around for the whole plan instead of letting her run off to help other plans.Thanos should have had a chance to give some kind of farewell speech instead of just disintegrate. He spent alot of time and movies talking up his ""great plan"". When he suddenly realizes that it's not gonna work and the Universe will eventually (or at least if he is right about everything) destroy itself from overpopulation, shouldn't he have been able to give a ""You'll all regret this!"" speech before vanishing away or something?Other than that...no complaints. Top notch special effects. Very emotional at times with the deaths of the main characters.All in all...very solid.",positive

"Sorry, guys I'm late... But here we go, let's talk about the spoiler stuff that I wanted to talk about Avengers: Endgame. So here's your warning, if you didn't watch the Endgame, don't read this review, go and check out my spoiler-free review.Let's start with Thor, the fat Thor was the most controversial part in the movie, for me I was so conflicted about him, is he good, or bad? The answer is ""both""! How is that? Let me tell you how. He was good because he was so funny, hilarious, and also it has a hidden message, that the way you look doesn't change anything at all, you still can be successful as you anyone else!
Bad because we have seen how powerful he can be in Thor: Ragnarok and Infinity War, so I wanted to see him more powerful in this one... Overall he was fine, but not what I wanted to see.The final battle was amazing, I was amazed of how good it was, but it was miss directed, cause it wasn't that long according to how it was rushed, it didn't give me the fight between Avengers and Thanos that I actually wanted to see, every time the shot was on them fight, it changes suddenly to someone else who's fighting his army, that was unfortunate actually!Thank you, guys for reading and supporting my work, really appreciate it, and if you liked it you can click on my name up above and see all of my reviews.",positive
"It was entertaining, but... A great ending for such a wonderful franchise? No.Every positive opinion given, was because of the marketing, of the euphoria and all that emotion of years and years of movies, coming to an end. I fell on that trap too.
The first time I watched it I was happy, then I kind of watched it again just to realize I enjoyed the movie because I went to watch it with my siblings whom I don't see to often.
That second time was hard to watch, i didn't even finished it.
To many plot holes that are to easy to find, to many nonsense explanations and not an specific tone.
The movie tries hard to be serious, but suddenly it tries to be funny. This stupid decision doesn't help you to feel bad for the characters you sympathized on other films. Even Iron Man's death made me feel annoyed, instead of sad. And I love that character too much!!!
They try to sound interesting at explaining another theory about rime travel, but it's so poor and idiotic that it can only fool, fools!
At last but not least. What the heck happened to Thanos? One of the greatest and powerful villains of Marvel, the principal enemy of this phase of the MCU. Reduced to a mediocre, weak, and not intimidating enemy. Every one could beat the crap out of him. Nothing compared to the Thanos of Infinity War, a menace to the whole avengers, even when he didn't have all the infinity gems.",positive

"The end of an era... Avengers: Endgame is directed by the Russo brothers and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Josh Brolin and all the cast of the previous MCU movies.After what Thanos did in Avengers: Infinity War, the Avengers gathering for one last time together to face the biggest threat of all time again, but this time, they're getting the help they needed last time... The epic conclusion of 3 phases of the MCU is here... So let's talk about it!If u read my review of Avengers: Infinity War so u know that this is my favorite movie of the MCU, and it still is.. unfortunately, why? Because I wanted this one to be the best of the MCU, but it's not.. let's go in depth about it, but don't worry, this one will have no spoilers.The MCU always had those delightful superheros and overpowered supervillains, with there first look at Thanos at the end of The Avengers, and I couldn't wait to see the Avengers vs Thanos, untill we got it in Infinity War, and I had my issues with it.. so I had to wait for the Endgame to see a rematch.. but more epic, u know!Let's start with the pros cause this one has plenty of them! Avengers: Endgame is so charming and humorous, even more than I actually expected.. even more than I needed! The humor sometimes felt there, and sometimes it did not... It also has one of the best performances so far, I won't be surprised if Robert Downey Jr. was nominated for an Oscar, because he gave us his best in this movie.The movie is 3 hours 2 min long, so it's a little risky, because the movie doesn't have to offer during the entire duration of this movie and that's a con, I know.. but the director and the cast knew how to make this movie catching from the moment it began to the moment it ended.. seriously, guys u won't feel like it's 3 hours long, yeah some scenes were so unnecessary, they just added time to the movie.. but still it's fun to see them this long one last time!The action sequences r not as much as Infinity War.. but I saw that coming from the trailer, because it had no fighting scenes, or anything.. it has some, but like Infinity War. But it has that one epic final fight that we all wanted to see, it's so epic that we couldn't just stop screaming during the entire fight! Right there, that epic scene overcome the Wakanda fight scene.. but didn't overcome the Titan fight scene, which contain the Avengers vs Thanos. We'll get to that point in the spoiler review.The movie also has those very emotional scenes, that will touch everyone's heart, even more than Infinity War... Way way more than Infinity War.At the beginning of the movie, u feel like this movie is gonna be the fastest movie ever, but I didn't feel like, cause I knew the way the movie is gonna go after then, and it took more time to do even that! The first act was so slow and dramatic, I love how they showed us the way these superheros feel like after their biggest failure, because it's their fault, and they know it, regret it and feel it for the first time. The second act is where things started to happen, again slowly, but still entertaining! The third act is all what we wanted to see, an hour of insanity!I said some cons, but my biggest one is an spoiler, but of them actually, so I will just hint some, and then I will talk about them in depth in my spoiler review.My biggest issue with this movie is that they really made a very powerful character a joke, it has its reasons but I didn't like it. Also the final fight didn't last for so long as I really wanted it to be, with the same issue that I had with Infinity War!Overall Avengers: Endgame is a great superhero movie and an amazing conclusion to this amazing era, but it's not perfect, no matter how hard I really wanted it to be!
I'm gonna give Avengers: Endgame and A-!Alright guys, thank u as always for reading my review, the spoiler review is coming up, along with Shazam! review... And as always, if u like it, u can click on my name up above and read my old reviews and the upcoming reviews!",positive

"Fan of the comics and the MCU. Massively overhyped movie. Has great emotional scenes and epic scenes, but the plot has as many holes as Quicksilver was left with. The time travel rules make no sense. Hulk and Dr. Strange do nothing in the final battle despite being two of the most powerful heroes in the movie. Thanos is stronger without the Gauntlet which makes no sense. Thor got screwed over. Overall very messy underwhelming movie.",positive
"In many of the battles in the MCU movie, End Game is the most thrilling.",positive
"I have more questions then answers. The ending felt rushed and the middle really added no value. But overall, it was a fun film with plenty of humor and some good action, although the action seemed too busy at times.",positive

"First off, I would like to get somethings off my chest. I'll admit, in terms of a pure film I feel that Infinity War was better as a whole than Endgame. I found Endgame to be quite predictable throughout and I felt that it suffered more with Marvel's usual pacing issues more so than IW. While enjoyable, I felt that this film pushed the comedic tones a little bit too much for my taste compared to the previous film and disrupted the overall balance.However, this film still defied my already sky high expectations. Endgame did exactly what the title said.. it was the Endgame and boy was it a sight to behold. From the bombastic fight scenes and the intersecting complexities between each character, the film never ceased to excite. In many ways, what Endgame did right was it took the spectacle that was Infinity War and somehow took it to an even bigger notch. I found the film to be overall a lot more memorable than its previous counterpart. Throughout its 3 hour run time (which honestly didn't even feel like it, time felt like a breeze inside the theater), I felt that the film as a whole was much more compelling and contained more scenes that constantly put me in the edge.Such a statement is quite daring to make, but I felt that Endgame did an absolutely remarkable job in leaving so much distinct and vivid imagery. A film of this magnitude is meant to be a spectacle, an emotional joyride, and a bonafide table-setter all bundled into one roller coaster of a ride and such expectation was met tenfold.What I also loved about Endgame was that it beautifully ended so many prominent character arcs, while also establishing the foundations for the new era of Marvel films. I especially loved all the subtle and not so subtle callbacks to the past films in the series, which is quite a treat for long time fans like me. These are not the easiest to achieve in film, but the Russo Brothers did an amazing job in piecing 11 years of cinema history in order to project the absolute perfect finale to one of the most iconic franchises in the history of cinema.Overall, it's not a perfect film by any stretch but it's impossible not to give it a 10/10. Endgame is supposed to tie up all the loose ends and questions from the 23 other movies in the MCU, which it accomplishes beautifully. It isn't as fine polished and clean as IW, but it didn't need to be. Endgame set out to do the job and it passed with an array of flying colors. To all the twist and turns throughout the 11 years since the MCU was firmly described, I can easily say that one of the most epic nights of my life. Fans old and new fans can easily appreciate how epic of a film this is. Marvel knew what was needed to be done in terms of making the infinity saga happen and it was absolutely worth the wait. This era of the MCU is going to be surely missed and I cannot thank Marvel Studios enough for a hell of a ride. This might be the Endgame, but it has and will continue to be worth every second of anyone's time.",positive
"I felt like my 10 year relationship had just ended.... but it was good, really good!",positive
"Avengers Endgame attains a valedictory level of closure (and even provides a bit of heartrending reflection/ quiet celebration) to end the first chapter of mighty ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" ushered in with the wildly successful 'Iron Man' first released nearly 11 years ago circa 2008. Most cinematic 'Marvels' released to theaters within the past decade have proved mega-entertaining and usually 'spot-on' in terms of bringing to life those heroes from hallowed comic-book pages (first envisioned by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Roy Thomas, John Buscema, Jim Starlin, et al). With regard to Epic ensembles and Galactic-spanning, mind-blowing action, and sheer kinetic energy (infused with ample does of inter-personal humor and suspense) it has really been the 'Avengers' (and related Captain America tie-ins by the brilliant Russo brothers team) that has established Marvel as the ultimate Cinematic brand that most always satisfies beyond measure and gives audiences much more than pure entertainment. Thru the Russo Bros. direction (along with Joss Whedon before - and James Gunn in the cosmic-future), Marvel's ensemble Avengers & Cap films (along with Guardians of course, which in many ways feels like a futuristic/ anarchistic extension of Avengers) have created a genuine modernized Mythology that feels like it will endure for near Eternity (or at least as long as the complete duration/ lifespan of an average Celestial-Titan),
**possible spoilers**
Avengers Endgame literally brings it all home and amply rewards the loyal Marvel Cinematic viewers that stuck it out for the last decade.
It is true there seems to be something for everyone here (i,e, scenes that will most definitely indelibly and emotionally impact fans of each member of the 'original' Avengers ensemble). A few of the final resolutions were a bit unexpected - but make more sense upon hindsight.
This movie runs nearly 3 hours but moves briskly (as though you spent only a fraction of that time in the proverbial 'quantum realm time machine'). The penultimate battle with Thanos is about as good-Epic as IMAX gets! (and all heroes get their chance to shine on screen - in the final attempt to wallop Thanos and his galactic-army)
The over-arching Story is solid and surprisingly maintains an inner-logic/ consistency throughout (although you do need to have seen the two earlier Russo Bros. Cap films especially 'Civil-War' and the first Guardians of the Galaxy, along with Infinity-War of course for this Story to really coalesce (and familiarity with the Infinity-Gauntlet comic series from the very early 1990's certainly doesn't hurt!).
Even the quietly reflective epilog like ending works surprisingly well, giving audiences the feeling of spending a few intimate moments with these beleaguered heroes (and human counterparts) who gambled it all and triumphed (but also sacrificed much).... and deserve the chance to get on with 'normal' lives (at least until the next overpowered Galactic tyrant sets foot on our pale blue Earth with malevolent intentions!)",positive
"To be honest, after infinity war i didn't think they could match it, but they managed to match it and i might even say surpass it. I'm a little late to the party but once i got the chance i went and can honestly say 3 hours flew by and i came out feeling emotional and wanting to talk to everybody about it which to me means the film was spot on. The end battle was absolutely epic but would recommend in 2d as in 3d it was very hard to catch everything going on. I will most definitely be returning to watch again.",positive
"Saldly is the last movie , I had my doubts about this movie, but it came trough, i like the story , the characters , actors are in tip top shape with the roles.Josh Brolin, brother, u played very well thanos, you know is a well played when I want to hurt you ,torture and then kill you, bring you back to life and kill you again. I felt so much angre and hate for thanos, i want it to fight along The Avengers just to see thanos dead. To bad that we will never see this team togeter anymore.",positive
"My son and I Loved infinity war 10 stars, great plot and character interaction, this one felt lacking in both. I'm glad others like it though, my kid who is 7 fell asleep 💤 at 1 hour, he asked me 40 mins in if it gets more interesting . When he awoke an hour later my answer was yes, but not much. Loved Captain America and the hammer, movie tingles in that scene. He might rate it lower?",positive
10/10 i loved it. It has fanservice and its a really epic movie. I remember in the crowd screaming when captain lifted thor Hammer. I liked more infinity but this is one is a really awesome movie.,positive
"Although I expected much more from this movie, it is still satisfying for me and a decent finale to the avengers series.
The movie starts with showing you how the snap affected one of the heroes life. then followed by the remaining avengers trying to protect the remainig world by fighting crime normally as they were doing before Thanos's time. After losing all hope, Ant-man finally returns to the avengers and introduces an idea that might actually work, but one that he can't carry out himself. This leads to the reunion of the avengers team which will spark events that will change the MCU forever.
The pacing of the events is not quiet thorough and some prolonged dramatic scenes fall apart and make you feel bored instead of sad. Also the most exciting and effective parts are all packed in the last hour.
one of the technical aspects that I did not like was the blurry transition, the camera takes a long time to focus on a character or un-focus from a scene and move on to the next, which really hurt my eye in the IMAX theater.
but overall, it was a nice experience and you shouldn't miss this one, infinity war is still the best MCU movie for me but endgame is among the greatest in the series.",positive
"Just 3 hours of fan service that doesn't really hold up to any scrutiny and doesn't really make sense from an objective standpoint. Obviously all (or most) superhero movies require a suspension of disbelief but they should atleast hold up to their own presumptions. When you start bending the whole narrative structure for some big moments, it just lessens the impact imho. Like for example, some big moments like Grandpa Rogers being there just for the sake of creating an emotional response, even though it massively undermines the character, or the specific choice of 5 years so they can force a 4 year old Morgan into the story for greater emotional impact.I've read a lot of comic books (mostly batman though), and have to hand it to marvel that they have mostly done a better job than DC with the movies, some examples being IW (my favourite MCU movie), Dr. Strange, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Thor Ragnarok, and Black Panther (overrated but still pretty good). Endgame is definitely not in that list, infact so much so that I feel 'Endlame' would've been a more honest and appropriate title.It makes no sense on so many levels, they basically reduced Thanos to a caricature (he had some impact in IW but here he's just a generic evil bad guy who doesn't think much), and time travel is the ultimate cop-out. I could go on with all the flaws and really dumb stuff (how the hell does Laura Barton's cellphone still work 😁, the power levels make no sense, Captain Marvel is conspicuously missing through most of it and why is she not aware of Thanos' genocide across planets etc), but basically the movie was absolute rubbish and takes massive liberties and leaps of logic which the fanboys blindly accept.I've been in the minority when it comes to movies before. I loved the universally panned BvS, though I'll add that the ultimate edition is the only one to watch. Sure it had it's share of silliness like the 'Martha' moment, but that movie got badly burned as a result while none of that seems to be affecting endgame. BvS did try (maybe too hard) to be different, but endgame just comes across as formulaic and deeply flawed.Marvel have at least stayed true to their formula though, while Warner Bros didn't have it in them to stick to the original vision. If they had stuck with Zack Snyder's planned 5-movie arc then we might have got Thanos AND Darkseid in the same year, which might've made both cinematic universes more interesting.",negative
Watched this more than 10times but still having goosebumps in the end.,positive
This is a good movie. But it could have been better. It has great acting. It also has a good story line. It is not a great story line mind you. The Avengers age of Ultron is mush better.,positive

"'Avengers: Endgame' is a film that manages to serve the 21 MCU films before it in a way that is almost magical, and near perfect. The film does a wonderful job at tying up and concluding so many storylines that have been present throughout the last 11 years and 22 films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film manages to out-do itself and delivers on absolutely gigantic and epic proportions. While the film isn't perfect and there are some slight gripes and nitpicks I definitely have, it is perfectly satisfying in the way it manages to close itself up. 'Endgame' offers a justifiable conclusion that can best be described as epic.",positive
"Perhaps the best of the Avengers series, this film still had some issues. It's a bit long, the time travel subplot is filled with holes, some characters appear for only 2-3 minutes or so and it's painfully predictable.Still the film is somehow enjoyable, maybe because they created lot's of interesting characters/heroes in the last 10 years and I found myself caring about them in the course of the film.I would say this would have definitely been a better film but it's still fun to watch.",positive
This was a really well made finale for the avengers franchise. They did an amazing job finishing it. The actors did a wonderful job as their characters. There were good ideas going on in this movie. It kept me interested throughout its long runtime. The actors fit into their roles perfectly. The action is excellent. The soundtrack is awesome. The humour in the film was brilliant. The emotional parts of the film were really well done. I cried a couple of times during the film. The ending was satisfying. This is a movie that you should experience. Lots of praise to the people who made this great movie.,positive
Maybe my expectations were too high but in the end this move was just OK. It isn't bad - and it is a must see if you are invested in the Marvel Universe - but it isn't great. Maybe it gets lost in trying to include too many characters or maybe is Disney trying to be PC and intentionally make it try to appeal to too many people but in the end it made it less interesting. It has its crowd cheering moments and is epic - but when the big spoilers happen I almost didn't care. Hopefully Marvel can reboot with the X-men and Fantastic 4 because the current group has run its course.,positive
"Jar Jar deserves an oscar compared to her. Her presence on screen makes you want to walk out. Not to mention the film is already filled to the brim with unncessary huge number of ""strong"" female characters to the point its absurd. And not cool, awesome strong female characters like Rene Russo's character, whom you believe is a bada5s and has depth.
So female Jar Jar aside (an insult to Jar Jar actually), the movie, the first half, is pretty darn good, with many great comical moments especially. Second half and especially the last third, it slows down and starts becoming the formulaic and typical hollywood film, full of empty fighting, streched out beyond all sensible constraints. The ending is also not very insipiring or clever.
Also at times it suffers from some quite bad writing. Like when Thor presents Valkyrie with Asgard as if it is this great gift to her. Remember Asgard, a majestic, wonderful city on a half waterfall, half clouds, with a rainbow and beautiful weather every day.
Asgard,that is NOW a small sh1thole of a fishing village, cold and damp 11 months out of the year, with pollution and just an overall miserable life. Who the F would want to be a queen of that ?
Anyway I dont see why it has such a high score, it definitely doesnt deserve it. Its not bad but its nothing special either with too many noticeable distractions that annoy you.",negative
"Too much drama; too many brief appearances just to show us everyone is back from dust; not enough action/fighting for such an advertised blockbuster?Enjoyed the unique sendoffs for those core members. Disappointed/sad they will no longer be in future versions (or will they??) But understandable that they were getting older/more expensive to keep around.Ideally, the team will keep Black Panther, Falcon, Scarlett Witch and Vision (at a minimum) or future movies will be watered down/lose luster.",positive
Cried twice in this! Can't say why as don't want to spoil it for anyone. But I'm a grown man and reduced me to tears and it wasn't the popcorn prices for a change!Well done Marvel for one of my favourite films ever!,positive
"It's funny, it's sad, its serious, it's crazy. The ending is mental.🤓 The plot is nuts.😋 4 years ago, I remember how surprised I was that Ironman, got such a great movie.🙂 I never dreamed that 21 films later, I'd be bawling in the theater, watching it all come to an end.😔
A culmination of 10 years and 21 movies deserves a finish like this.👏 I will never ever get over that ending.✊ When Iron Man's heartbeat stopped, I felt someone ripped out my heart. 💔
11 years, 21 movies, all leading to #AvengersEndgame 😎",positive
"After all the effort to kill the mighy monster did not go in vein. Yes! They did it. He is gone. I felt like the last 30 mins of the movie was totally unwanted, maybe they just wanted to make sure to show the fans that's Robert Downey and Chris Evans are not part of the brand anymore. I would like to understand the use of taking the stones back to the future in the end, what if Thanos plays an ant man role to bring back the stones. The movie is all about visuals, it's awesome. I felt like they have dragged the movie a bit, with some unwanted scenes, like Nat and Clint sacrifice fight before the acquiring the soul stone. Even the iron man needs so inspiration, The iron man wants to make sure his chances are not wasted, he grabbed the stones only after realising that this is the 1 chance in 14 millions possibilities.",positive

Well worth waiting a year for. Had just enough humour. Fantastic editing and special effects. One of the best movies I've ever seen!,positive
"Typical Marvel movie. Too much fan service that takes away time from developing plot or character development. Also, Time Travel....... As always more problems than it solves. Pretty much ruins the entire set of previous films. Watch it, but dont think too much about it. For a Marvel film, it's middle of the road. Highlight, Iron-man finally getting his due.",positive
"I know I'm late to the game here, but I can't remember the last time a movie lived up to THIS much hype...if anything, they undersold it a little.
Three hours went by like 90 minutes....by the end I was just slackjawed.
I now wish I'd seen it opening night.
Anyone nitpicking this movie....I am so sorry for your sad little life.",positive
I was with this movie until maybe the 40 minute mark. I rewatched all the mcu movies in order for the first time ever according to timeline and I came across this one and was like wow the movie before was so much better and the ending just wasn't satisfying for me. For starters 3 hours is crazy run time I remember seeing this in theaters and I just got to the point I wanted it to be over it really is too much. Next i like how it starts. They get together what's left of them track down thanos and kill him great.... Butttt this is the problem I have I feel like that should be the movie. So Ant man randomly shows back up. Tony naturally discovers hey time travel is possible thanks to ant man. That's the next part time travel has that not been done to death?? Even while they are going through movie examples it really shows you that hey wow all these other countless movies out there time travel so why can't we. To me end game is watchable and still good enough but I think they missed here the first 30 minutes could've been the movie. They avenge (pun intended) their friends and everyone lost by defeating thanos and have a crazy battle and that's it. Satisfying to me. Lastly and I know this is where there will be the disagreements. I'm tired of these super hero cliché movies where there has to be a happy ending. Like why? Let's face reality these movies are always crazy enough that all these battles happen but none of the good guys can die but all the bad guys can be taken down. That's why infinity war to me was the way superior film. They did something that so many superhero movies before them didn't have the guts to do. You still could've sacrificed tony at the end of this movie as he kills thanos by sacrificing his life. But no bc Hollywood/Disney needs money you have to bring back all these other characters or how else will you make future films and make money. Still a 7/10 bc I love all these actors and the opening was good but I just cannot rank it higher than a 7. Infinity war set them up for something big and this to me wasn't it. If losing Robert Downey Jr. Was what they needed to do to move on them they still could've done it the way I explained.,positive
"Absolutely awful. No cohesion, no real story, no substance whatsoever, perhaps the score might give it one point? Utter garbage. Story pathetic that at times the actors were looking embay",negative
The day has come where all comes to an end. The hype was high and so do the ratings and although I am not a marvel comics fan (but a movie's one) I must agree with it. This is probably the best marvel movie ever.After 10 years all comes to this and I must sat it is a good way to end. All good things come to an end and so do the avengers. Now we can only wait and see what Disney will do but nothing will ever be the same.Meanwhile I will sit on a corner a decide what to do with my life!!,positive
"You will have these set of things that you would expect from a superhero movie and this one checks every box and more.
You will definitely will not feel that this was not enough.
Just about everything in the right amount.
You get laughter,you get a gripping story,you get a wonderful thrilling experience ,if u are a marvel fan then this would be the perfect movie for you.
The direction was perfect CGI on point,nothing to change,nothing to correct.

But about the film it self: first of all, this film will make you cry and it will break and heal your heart at the same time. It will do it so beautifully that you will never forget it. I watched the endgame 3 times in a row today and honestly I think I'll watch it again.
I enjoined Every second of the movie. Thank you marvel, god bless you.",positive

"I went wanting to enjoy this movie as much as everyone seemed to. I have to admit, the story was rushed a bit. Understandably, they had many big characters to squeeze in the movie...but so was infinity war and that story was more straightforward. Its a good movie, but a few bits wont make sense and i think it would have been better to make two 120min movies instead of compiled 3 hour movie. One last note, the you wont see the ending coming and out of all the theories about what will happen, only one was right...",positive

I don't know how they pull of something this great making sure the movie gave importance to each and every character in it.... I know how hard it can be when u got a lot of superheroes in one movie and you got to make sure u don't screw it up.
Russo,s did not... Thank you for this.Such a great way to end this journey. What an ending! ENDGAME",positive
"Endgame turned out to be a good one time watch but fell a bit short of my expectations. Go in with low expectations and you might think differently. What follows next in this article is a bunch a questions I had and a ton of spoilers which go with them. Along with those are some of those goosebumps worthy moments in the movie and a small review as well. So read along only if you don't mind the spoilers.How did Hawkeye end up with the Soul stone? Nat killed herself and she is definitely not one that Hawkeye loved the most. I thought you need to sacrifice that you loved the most to get the Soul stone ?
The Time Travel sequence did mess up my brain. The second snap is supposed to have put things back to prior to when the first snap took place for the people who perished in the snap. It now meant that 50% of the population has lived all the way from 2018 to 2023 while the remaining 50 percent of the population is probably just waking up in 2023, seconds after they went into a nap in 2018. Mixed timelines for everyone. Spiderman Far from home is going to be interesting in this aspect unless every character from part 1 were snapped to dust only to return, unaged in 2023.
Loki from 2012 took off with the Tesseract and this should have some real huge ramifications in the current day timeline including the events of Thor 2, Ragnarok and even Infinity Wars. Remember, this was still the time when Loki was still the bad guy and could have had serious impact in the whole timeline of any story that happened afterwards and did he survive the events of the Infinity war due to this new timeline ?
I am still not able to wrap around the fact that they found it okay to go back and change the timeline for saving half the population but found it okay that certain few individuals could be sacrificed in the process when time-travel was still a possibility. The availability of Pym particles should not really be a criteria as there definitely should be somebody who could have ended up developing something that was discovered in 1970's. If you time travel once and do end up creating those alternate timelines, you should definitely be okay to do it again to save someone else you lost in a previous timeline. Marvel jumped right into the time travel mess that 20th Century had with X-Men.
Now about Mjolnir. Why on earth did the out-of-shape lazy Thor bring it back from the 2013 Asgard or did Cap return it while returning the stone. After all the things done to alter the past what prevented Thor from telling his mother what the battle of Maliketh meant to her future? That was something Thor should have let out considering the fact that the whole movie treated Thor like an idiot (I repeat, not one with sense of humor but one who is an idiot).
Where did vision go ? He should have been part of the last scene right or was it because the snap happened after Vision died?
What about Cap's splintered timeline? He effectively had a different life post the events of 2023 in the 1970's as a superhero and ended up taking no part in any of the events of the previous Marvel movies ? That would make him a superhero who couldn't care any less about 'bad' events that were supposed to happen and he could have prevented.
Now, to the event that I could not wrap my head around even a wee bit. Thanos from 2014 went to 2023 (present) to get dusted himself by the Avengers. So essentially he dies even before he got hold of even a single Infinity stone. That pretty much wipes out almost 90 percent of all the bad things that happened in the past few Marvel movies. Does it not essentially mean that other than Tony and Nat the rest of the world survived as they never had Thanos to deal with in the first place?
Doctor Strange and his pals does this space travel thing through the circle of fire thing (for lack of better words) to get all the Avengers to the right spot, even from far away planets with a blink of an eye. Why on earth didn't he do the same during the course of the other movies (especially Infinity war) when they could have really done with some space travel to get to where the action was? Is it some sort of skill that pops up only when there needs to be no explanation provided?
There should be a lot more that I missed as the movie as such has too much going on in too less of a timespan and yet it felt like some of the scenes could have been avoided. The movie itself started off brilliantly with an emotional tone and the mood pretty much remains the same throughout. If I were to select one character that had the movie gave justice to the most, it has to be Cap, even though Tony had a better sent off and if I were to select one character that was absolutely marginalized and made useless, it has to be Thor with a whopping margin.Thanos has to be one of the most wholesome villains ever in Movie history. His goals are not mired by emotion. He has absolute faith in himself and he genuinely believes in the result of his actions. How a 'stone-less' Thanos was still stronger than most of the Avengers combined was something I could not wrap my head around. This could have been one of the reasons why they kept Thor fat and Captain Marvel far away from action to bring some parity to the proceedings.Now to some of those goosebumps worthy scenes, most of them involved Cap (not a Cap fan here!)Avengers Assemble !
'I can do this whole day'. 'Yeah, yeah, I know'
'Hail Hydra'
'I went for the head'
'I knew it'

"I am simply speechless about what to say. This is the best movie ever made. This movie is just the perfection. The plot, screenplay are just outstanding. The direction is unparalleled. Plot of all previous movies and the connection placement is so incredibly done. Russo Brothers just nailed it. Again!!!",positive
To clarify when I saw Logan thought it was the best movie that closed out a superhero series till I saw Avengers end game. I was an incredible experience in modern film making. SPOILER ALERT. In the scenes when Tony Stark and Captain America go back to 1970 stan lee's cameo he was driving a 72 cutlass should have been 1970.,positive
"So I just got back from the midnight premiere of ""Avengers: Endgame"" and boy, I can not tell anyone enough just how epic and grand this movie was. It makes all the other Marvel movies over the last decade incredibly worth it, and brings the story that began all the way back in 2008 with ""Iron Man"" full circle. I can confidently say that this movie is even better than ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"". And this is coming from a guy who attended the midnight double feature premiere of ""Deathly Hallows"" on July 15, 2011.""Endgame"" is just an epic, fun, and exciting film filled with fantastic action sequences, funny humor to lighten the mood, and excellent drama between the Avengers characters that audiences have come to know and love over the last decade. The acting is just phenomenal with everyone getting their chances to shine and my hat goes to Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark who arguably gives the best performance of the film and possibly the best out of the entire franchise. He just embodied the character of Iron Man with his quirky mannerisms and traits. He puts his heart and soul into the character that he is the character. The film is probably the most emotionally gripping out of all the Marvel movies and bonus points for extra emotion go to audiences like myself who have been watching these movies since the first ""Iron Man"". I can not explain enough just how amazing this film is and it serves as the perfect conclusion to the Avengers series. At the same time, I am kind of sad to see what I've come to know and love come to an end. But good things eventually do have to come to an end at some point.",positive
"Before you start tearing your eyes out because you think this film was a masterpiece, I can assure you that it most certainly was not. Was it fun to watch? Absolutely. It was fun and funny but the film is riddled with plot holes and attempts to alter its entire arc to accommodate a wider universe that apparently relies on Captain Marvel which makes no sense. The film felt very lazy when it came to the interweaving of ten years of previous films and ultimately falls flat on its face. Perhaps the films after this will fix the mistakes but calling it the end of the infinity saga leads us to believe it is the beginning of an entirely new timeline saga since the timeline we knew is now long gone.

"So i grew up with this movies and it whas just so unreal to finaly see this and it whas better than i tough It would be!Great parts in the film
Time traveling whas perfectly fitt into the movie
The battle whas just so epic!! And i think every marvel fan out there agree me on that one
Iron man death whas so emotional but also so powerfull to see
i could go on forever but let's go on to the bad partsThe bad
Is that is over):",positive
"1. They emasculated the heck out of Thor
2. Captain America using the hammer and summoning lightning ruined it.
3. Pepper Pots putting armor on and Cpt Marvel girl power agenda was a bit much. Even my wife said so.
4. Any Joe Schmoe can hold an infinity stone now?
5. Falcon becoming the new CA is lame
6. Hulks part was kinda dumb
7. Shouldn't SpiderMan and most of his classmates all be 5 years apart in age now?",positive
"I did not like Endgame. Infinity War was so good.. I don't know why, but.. i did not leave the cinema with a good feeling after watching this film.. thanos brought so much pain and then he is just working in his garden? Weak and aimless?
In my opinion, it wasn't funny what happens with Thor's belly.. and the rest of him..
He has always been this strong man and suddenly he is afraid of everything.. idk
And of course, it made me really sad that Black Widow died instead of hawkey. In the end of the day, I am also sad bc of Iron Man, too.Gamora hasn't often shown her real feelings to quill and now she has even forgotten him.. bc it is past gamora from the other timeline.. it feels wrong..I didn't like the story as much as I expected. I had high hopes.",negative
"I've already seen it twice and still feel I could watch it again and be surprised by its grandiosity. The cast is absolutely unbelievable, they are all there, together. The action is breathtaking, it basically never ceases. And the drama... I had never cried so much in a cinema before. The emotional rollercoaster of a lifetime!",positive
"Amazing ending for the avengers! Although my favourite was the Ironman, it was nice to sacrifice for the good of all the others. It was an epic and heroic ending for him. I liked a lot the humor of hulk and especially Thor. Also I enjoyed the fights between Thanos and avengers. There were not overpowered scenes. Every little thing was perfect !!! Undoubtedly this movie movie deserves a 10/10 Bravo bravo bravo!!!",positive
"I know I gave it a 9/10 but there's a reason for that there are 2 epic scenes in this film that deserve the 9/10 rating, but the movie overall was 7/10 maybe a little lower 6.9/10, I just expected more, this morning or started great and surprising, but then the middle was lost and messy to say the least the ending was epic though,",positive
I have never ever cried at a film....... until now. The most incredible and thrilling movie I have encountered. Marvel could not have made this film any better. They captured every moment perfectly. I really can not put into words just how fantastic this film is!,positive
"Great movie but batle should be longer. This was a lost opportunity to show all heroes using their powers, more time for Captain Marvel fighting, Hulk less intelectual and more beast, and imagine if Wolverine appears from one of the circles!",positive
"Alot of things could have been done better. The whole film is based on a time-travel idea that Antman came up with and Antman doesn't get enough credit or time in the film. Hawkeye gets more time in the film! Who cares about Hawkeye?! Slow in parts. Reminds me of Avengers Assemble, most of the film is build up to a final, end of film battle. Much preferred Infinity Wars pace, energy and action-packedness. Infinity War made me so excited for Endgame. Endgame made me want to rewatch Infinity War.",positive
"*WARNING: though this review doesn't contain any Endgame spoiler, it does contain some major spoilers to Infinity War. And anyway, if you haven't seen Infinity War yet you shouldn't watch Endgame, so yeah*So, Endgame picks up more or less where Infinity War left off - the world in pieces, half the population is gone, Thanos has finally won and everyone feel helpless. Yet, as a sign of hope shows to change the outcome of Infinity War, the Avengers gather once again.Endgame is another flawed movie that I find enjoyable overall. It does some of the things that Infinity War did badly in a better way, and vice versa - it sometimes fails to have some of the qualities of Infinity War.For instance, I feel like this film has a more confident sense of dread at points, while Infinity War mostly couldn't have more than half a scene without some comic relief. Here there are a few scenes that actually commit to the vibe.I think that it has a slightly better cinematography too, and almost every scene here feels like it belongs in a Marvel comic book, which is cool.Iron Man also had a very decent character arc here, which has more impact if you've seen the change that he went through from the beginning of the MCU to this point. Also, he probably has the best dialogue in the film, too.However, as I said earlier, this movie is FLAWED. If Infinity War, managed to give every character its moment, Endgame doesn't really succeed in that in my eyes.Also, Endgame has quite a few plotholes, which isn't a horrible thing but it definitely makes the film, especially towards the final act, feel less impactful.Another thing that really bothers me is Captain Marvel. Oh, don't get me STARTED on her. Her character is honestly one of the worst in the MCU, she doesn't have any characteristic other than ""feminist"" and ""overpowered"" which is quite a shame, considering how important her role is here.So, yeah, I think that I'll conclude it there. A nice movie overall, but again, very flawed. I think that I enjoyed it slightly more than Infinity War, but I still feel the same about the film overall score-wise - a 6.5/10.",positive
"This movie is the apex of cinema for my generation. They give you every emotion possible, love, hate, tension and the balance is just perfect. When you think something will happen you got bamboozled. The characters mix is perfect, soundtrack, action scenes and everything else.",positive

"It's easy to be jaded. So many great shows and movie series build up and up, only to end with a whimper, retroactively stripping the earlier material of much of its quality. They get you to care about the characters, they get you involved in the plot, only to pull a ridiculous left turn or lose their way entirely, hobbling off into oblivion.Marvel could have joined those ranks. In fact, it was hard to see how they wouldn't do that. With all they'd built up over a decade plus, if they didn't deliver a great finale, it would have cast a retroactive shadow. Thankfully, I'm happy to say, they delivered all they needed to and more, cementing what will become known as the ""Infinity Saga"" as a generation-defining cultural behemoth that my kids will show their kids just as I've shared Star Wars with my own.The movie is just over 3 hours, but it very much needs all of that time to tell the story it needs to tell. The scale of this thing is mind-boggling. So many huge actors. So many characters. It could have been a mess.Instead, it hits all its marks expertly. It is both genuinely funny and genuinely emotional. The action serves a purpose and can be followed. The characters follow unforced, natural arcs that don't feel contrived or predetermined.The movie focuses on Iron Man and Captain America above all, which is appropriate - they have been the divided (sometimes violently so) heart of the Avengers since at least Civil War, and their somewhat competing visions have shaped everything else. In the end, I left with an overwhelming sense that the story had gone exactly where it needed to go. It was fulfilling. I am in awe of the fact that they pulled this off.",positive
"Even though it isn't a happy ending for some but as Robert Downey jr. aka Tony Stark said it doesn't always roll on that way. Part of the journey is the end. No journey is complete without an ending, and Avengers: Endgame brought to the infinity saga the perfect one.We saw that the six initial Avengers (the OGs) have evolved each in his own way. Indeed, Tony Stark who's gone from a selfish playboy to a hero who sacrificed his life for the survival of mankind, and he's become a very lovable and protective father and husband. Steve Rodgers has shown us that he is worthy of lifting Mjolnir ( as we would have expected since his scene in Avengers: Age of Ultron where he is trying to lift the hammer and was the closest to succeed ) and by doing so, it shows us that Dr. Abraham Erskine was right all along: Captain America is really pure of heart. Also, by going back in time to continue living his life where he stopped and had this dance with his One is a special and emotional scene. It gives to the character a well deserved and peaceful retirement. He couldn't have missed his date for much longer after all. Now Thor, as we all know, went through a lot of pain; his path wasn't the easiest. Indeed losing most of his people, had his family killed ( except Odin who died peacefully ) and the idea of losing against the mad titan made the god of thunder miserable. But after his confrontation with his now dead mother, and some pep talk offered by Rocket, he regained hope. In addition, by lifting his old hammer we can see that Thor was still worthy even after he battled with anger and depression. Hulk has gone from a wild, angry uncontrollable beast to a more intelligent and sentimental one. Bruce Banner finally gained control over the monster inside of him. The story of Natasha Romanoff is a sadder story, in fact she turned from a lone wolf to a wolf who works better with a pack. If you didn't get my metaphor, Black Widow didn't trust anybody. She was always vigilant with the others. But the Avengers gave her a family, they were the only people she could trust. So sacrificing her self for the better good of her new familia is a huge changing for the character. And at last but not at least Clint Barton aka Hawkeye aka Ronin. He turned from a caring father to an assassin who's gone rogue. After his family turned to dust, his only goal was killing bad guys, but when hope came knocking to his door he was ready to sacrifice himself to bring his family back.",positive
"Wow, what an ending to the incredible journey... Clever, endearing, thrilling, surprising, funny as, heartwarming and so utterly entertaining! How they accomplished so much within one film I do not know and yet those 3 hours went by in the blink of an eye. I would say that Captain Marvel sticks out like a bit of a sore thumb and is in contrast to the rest of the characters but thankfully she's not it in too much. All the favourites are on point throughout with special devotion given to the original 6 and yet it still manages to accommodate everyone new too. Quite a remarkable and I can't wait to get back to the cinema this weekend and watch it all over again! Thank you Marvel, you've achieved something extraordinary!",positive
"Unlike infinity war this movie lets you see the emotions our hero's are feeling and what their going through, it goes way more in dept about their relationships with one another. The throwbacks when they tune travel back to the first Avengers, GoT and Captain America really shows how much build up was put into the Endgame. I was really happy that they showed that Thanos could really fight even with out the stones, and when Cap picked up Mjolnir I lost my mind and then when all the vanished hero's came back it will really get you soo hyped and as a Marvel fan I was so happy to finally have seen Cap day Avengers Assemble it will really blow you away. The scene Iron Man looks at Strange and he tells him one chance, then Iron Man finishes it it will really get you in the feels, and at the funeral was really mysterious as there was people you'd not seen before. Over all the movie is by far the best Mcu movie...heck best movie of all time. Everything I've wanted.",positive
"After watching Infinity War, i thought that was the masterpiece, they couldnt possibly go better.
How wrong i was.That bought you down low, they took you up high, made you laugh and shout and scream and then cry.These brothers are genius.There are some issues with the movie, some annoyances, but given how good the movie is as a whole, i ignored them. But a week later they are still niggling at the back of my mind, so i had to remove a star.",positive
"After the devastating conclusion of last year's bombastic Avengers: Infinity War, the remaining Avengers who were fortunate enough to survive the 'Thanos Snap' (in which half the population were reduced to ashes) find themselves in a position they've never before found themselves: defeated. Thanos succeeded in his mission to restore balance, leaving all those who survived to mourn those they tragically lost. With the mad titans whereabouts unknown, the Avengers devise a plan to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet in order to bring back everyone they lost. Meanwhile, Tony Stark (Downey Jr) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) remain adrift in space with oxygen and food gradually running out, along with their hope of somehow being rescued.Joe and Anthony Russo (directors of previous MCU entries The Winter Soldier and Civil War) had a monumental task on their hands. Infinity War was staggeringly ambitious, but Endgame serves as the conclusion of The Infinity Saga, a 22-film epic that began with Iron Man in 2008. With so many character arcs and storylines to bring to a satisfying conclusion, it's an absolute wonder that the Russo Brothers pull it off as spectacularly as they do, because Avengers: Endgame certainly delivers a fantastic finale worthy of the 11-year journey.Picking up not too long after the shocking events of Infinity War, Endgame reintroduces our beaten heroes in a sombre state of mourning, marking a dramatic shift in tone when compared to the action-packed openings of the previous Avengers films. It isn't all despairing gloom, however, as the traditional MCU humour that has been present in every entry of the series thus far is carefully sprinkled throughout, creating a carefully constructed balance between solemn drama and light hearted comic relief. Fortunately, neither one of those elements overshadow the other. With a film of such a broad canvas (running at a precise 3 hours, the longest MCU instalment to date), Endgame serves as a greatest hits montage of sorts, highlighting various plotlines and memorable moments of previous instalments, resulting in a film that provides an overwhelming tidal wave of fan service. This, of course, is no bad thing, and what's commendable about the whole ordeal is that the plot never gets lost in the noise.Just like Infinity War, the film crams in an army of diverse characters. An inevitable factor of the film is that a select few of this mighty ensemble are shuffled off to the side-lines, but the core focus of Endgame are the original six Avengers that started it all, and rightfully so. Iron Man, Captain America (Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Johansson), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) take centre stage here, and the film very much feels like a glorious celebration of their time in the MCU and an emotional goodbye to their iconic characters that many have grown up with over the past 11 years. As their sprawling character arcs come to their satisfying conclusions, it's difficult not to feel the emotional weight of it all, and Endgame packs more than its fair share of gut punches. One of the more underutilized characters of the MCU is undoubtably Gillan's Nebula, but here she is thrust into the spotlight on several occasions, highlighting the complex journey that Nebula has taken throughout her time in this cinematic universe, from one dimensional side-note villain, to one of the most complex and emotionally rich characters we've seen so far.Endgame's triumphant third act is an absolute marvel to behold. It's an explosive, chaotic battle between good and evil that crams so much magnificent spectacle in every single frame that it's almost impossible to take it all in on first viewing. What the Russo's capture during this final conflict is a comic book fans dream come true, with top tier cinematography by Trent Opaloch. It all leads to a staggeringly awesome yet emotional climax that will undoubtably go down in history as one of the most iconic moments in comic book cinema.The MCU revolutionised the comic book movie, cementing their place in pop culture and even captured the imaginations of those who may have never before read a comic book in their lives. Comic book movies today are what spaghetti westerns were in the 60's and 70's, and it seems as though the MCU still has many more stories to tell in the years ahead. Endgame ultimately delivers a worthy ending, concluding The Infinity Saga in an epic fashion. It's visually brilliant, emotionally driven, and is the MCU's greatest achievement yet.",positive
This movies was not bad but after seeing Infinity War I was expecting better. 7/10,positive
"This movie is perfection in modern cinema, great ending and gives great closure for the franchise.",positive
"Saying this is the best movie ever is the equivalent of only watching the season finale of a series without having any context and saying it's the best series ever?! It is entertaining and awe inspiring how they handled the huge cast ensemble, but as a standalone film it is rather lacking. Great if you love the MCU, but it rather bloated in runtime and typically sentimental. Great if you want ""checkout"" for a few hours and enjoy some of the action sequences and the trademark quips expected from this production house.",positive
"This movie was awful; the acting was abhorrent, the special effects looked like a spy kids movie, and the plot was verging on completely ludicrous. I was ready for a simple popcorn flick, but this movie committed the worst crime of all; it was horrendously boring.This film had zero depth, the characters were two dimensional, and the jokes mostly fell flat for me. The actors looked bored, and at times there was more green screen than the Star Wars prequels. Worse still, there were times where it felt like certain actors weren't even on set at the same time as the others, and it was all edited together afterwards.I wish I had the infinity glove so I could click my fingers and cut this movie by 50% of its runtime.",negative
"So I've never written a review before but thought this deserved it. Before watching this I found myself wondering how this movie would play out, how it would all work. Let me tell you, it all worked and in a way I never imagined it would. The story was just so perfect. It had everything, from laughter to sadness and pure awe inspiring satisfaction. The ending was probably perfect. I was literally sitting in my seat with my mouth open from amazement from what I was watching. I truly believe this movie deserves an Oscar for best picture.",positive
"Avengers Infinty war broke us into two pieces with it's shock ending Thanos has done what he set out on doing he collected all of the infinty stones and he snapped his fingers and half of reality into dust and The Avengers and the rest of the universe felt the effects of the snap and now the remaining Avengers pick up the peices from whats happend and now must avenge the fallen.
The usual cast return for endgame the cast is very large so i will not individualy mention every actor and actress they all had a large role in the movie and they all play a equal part in the story. Special mention has to go obviously to Josh Brolin as Thanos he is just incredible as probabaly one of the best villians put into film and Thanos has proven in Infinty War and in Endgame that he is such a great villian and he always will be. Special mention also has to go to Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr they have officialy left Marvel and the MCU and I wish them well on there next projects and I want to thank them for what they have contributed to Marvel and the MCU and they have always been a part of my life and they always will be and they were the foundation on what the entire MCU and the 10 years of incredible movies which have been a part of thousand of lives so thank you for all of your hard work.
Things that I loved about Endgame well it's everything nothing really dissapointed me i felt every emotion happy sad and everything imbetween becides some minor plot holes that I felt spoiled some parts I thought it was amazing and it was by far Marvel's best film in it's filmography.
It was incredible what a experience and the best 3 hours i have spent watching a movie 10/10",positive
I really enjoyed this movie. Not only did this movie have great actors.. very good story line and I love the way they throw in some comedy too. Enjoyable and entertaining.,positive
"There is a weird glee in watching a movie alone. You start to appreciate the goods and notice the flaws much more easily in a film. Endgame has its flaws. More so than the Infinity war I think. In the infinity war, Thanos was simply an unstoppable force. The sheer desperation to find some way to beat him somehow and still be outmatched by Thanos, in the end, was palpable. Thanos was unwavering; both physically and in the motif - to bring an end to overpopulation. In Endgame, not so much. Thanos only shows physicality and without spoiling it I would say, his motif somehow becomes typically villainous. Thanos is not so much of a ""well-doer of the universe, whatever it takes"" anymore. Another thing is that the Avengers faced quite a less challenge in Endgame, compared to infinity war. Whether it's in procuring a plan to beat him or to execute it, they weren't that much challenged as they were in the previous film. But these things aside, Endgame is a very well rounded film. And boy was it damn enjoyable. Characters were fleshed out really well. The longer screentime really helped in that aspect. All the characters showed heroism and larger than life charisma we expect to see. And the final third of the film was nothing less than spectacular. Endgame is the culmination of 11 years of story-arch. Endgame is the celebration of the end of the Infinity saga. Endgame has achieved something which is really hard to pull off - giving a coherent and satisfying end to the 20 films that came before it. Marvel has succeeded in that aspect and that's where I think DCEU struggles really hard. But Marvel did it flawlessly. Endgame truly is a marvel of a superhero film; and definitely one of the best of MCU; For me, coming in at second place after Captain America Winter Soldier and Civil War.
But judging by the hype and rating, is it better than The Dark Knight?
NO!!!!
Dark Knight still holds the position for the best superhero movie ever made, not even Dark Knight Rises could beat it and Endgame couldn't do it either. MCU and DCEU have the brawn but they don't have the brains of The Dark Knight. But does that make Endgame any less capable? No. Endgame is what Endgame is supposed to be - a heartwarming & proper way to say goodbye to the original Avengers and start a new phase for MCU. And I love it 3000 times <3

"I could write a book about the emotional roller coaster I've been on this last decade. As a lifelong MCU fanatic, I can say I am beyond happy with how this journey started, progressed, and ended. Endgame was the perfect ending to this saga. As a 25 year old, I will probably never witness a cinematic adventure at such a scale ever again in my lifetime.
All things considered, and without exaggeration, I can say this movie, after seeing all the MCU movies before it, is the greatest entertainment experience I have ever had.",positive
One of the best movie and now the marvel completed it 21 movie as well as phase 3The suspense is really so goodi especially like the new look of Thor and Hulk they made them a different and really funny 😂😂The one thing is very sad; the Iron Man (Tony Stark) sacrifice himself to save the universe and to win against ThanosI will not watch the Avengers if Tony Stark not present in it.,positive
"Epic opening scene follow by 90 mins of nothing special followed by 80 mins of waves of poor quality to solid quality with a epic final battle scene. So many parts that made zero sense. The more time that goes on the less sense some of the story line makes. I could go on for hours about stuff that was negative and about 15 mins of quality to be spoken of. Look, everyone will watch for themselves. Ultimately disappointing unless your a stubborn baised superfan who believes marvel can do no wrong.",positive
"The biggest takeaway from 'Avengers: End Game' is just how much of an emotional roller coaster it is. There are countless opportunities to laugh out loud throughout the three hour movie-our personal favorite was the line ""pick a side, Lebowski""-which themselves are perfectly balanced (pun intended) by thrilling action sequences, nostalgic interludes, and genuine moments of sadness.Despite Endgame representing the denouement of the Avengers franchise (and the 22nd film to be released by Marvel Studios for the Marvel Cinematic Universe) the movie itself is also surprisingly self-contained. The only thing anybody would have to know going into the film is that Thanos snapped his fingers at the end of the last installment and half of all living things vanished into dust.Speaking of Thanos, his arc is presented most masterfully of all, far more unexpected and complex than anyone could've reasonably guessed. And as of this moment there's a brilliant Easter Egg on Google celebrating the opening of 'Avengers: End Game.' Google ""Thanos"" then click on the Gauntlet icon containing the infinity stones on the right hand side of the screen. Enjoy.Rating: 8.5/10",positive

"I love superheroes. I was raised reading comic books. I watched every film since the first Iron Man. I know when the MCU gets something right. And in this film, they got it wrong. So, so wrong.I will admit, that this film is a spectacle. But, it's a horrible spectacle. It's a ""I can practically hear the money being burned"" sort of spectacle.It's not even technically up to scratch! This film has incredibly badly shot scenes. With framing that is wrong, horrible -Horrible- lighting, the CGI is obviously put together with duck tape in some scenes. I know they did a lot of reshoots, and then I'm guessing the VFX studios didn't have enough time to fix anything but -my dudes, this movie cost upwards of 300 million dollars. Have *some* dignity.And now the dreaded part: The Plot.It feels like, they shot the film, showed it to a test audience, they didn't like it, and then the writers put their heads together and went ""what sort of fan service can we add to this mess, to make it palatable?"", and that was it.This film's plot isn't coherent. If you dissect it, it doesn't make any sense. Those are not decisions the Avengers would have made. For so many reasons. For one thing, they spent Age of Ultron, Civil War, and I don't know how many other movies, discussing how they can't just decide to make huge changes to the world without taking permission from the citizens, and the governments. And then, they decided to bring back 4 billion people (not to mention animals), without asking anyone. Without even ensuring the planet had enough resources (after 5 years of working a 50% capacity) to make sure this HUGE addition to the population had food to eat.And that was only 1 side-error this film made. I could go on, for a long time. Because this was a long film. And it was so, so bad.Another thing that wrecked the experience for me- for the first time in the MCU, there were moments when I felt the actors were not even acting. Some of the character story lines were so ill-developed that even the acting was off, especially for Cap. I was looking at Chris Evans, and seeing Chris Evans and not Steve Rogers in many occasions! I don't even blame the guy, the script he was handed was a mess.For those who don't believe me, that the writers did a sloppy job, I will give you an example. When Natasha dies, they try to pull at our heartstrings by mentioning her family. Her father's name. Ivan. Only, that's not her father's name. We know her name, it's Natalia Alianovna Romanova. Russians take the middle name from their fathers. Alianovna literally means daughter of Alian. They wrote a main character death and yet they didn't have the decency to research enough to get her name right.Anyway, I know it doesn't matter what I think. I know it doesn't matter what any of us thinks because at this point, put the Marvel logo on anything and it will sell. Which is why the writers care less and less about their stories, to the point where we get to this utter failure, that nobody will ever look back and think ""I should do an MCU marathon and watch Endgame"". Nobody.Nowadays, when theatres have nothing to show, they can screen Lord of the Rings, and be sure -people will show up to see Return of the King on the big screen. I'd have to be dragged in the theatre kicking and screaming to watch Endgame again.",negative

"This is the most amazing movie I've ever seen, i have watched all the marvel franchise numerous times but this tops everything. It was extremely well acted, the actors and actresses should be greatly credited. Very emotionally impacting, which was done beautifully well. Hopefully not giving any spoilers, it has (in my opinion) the best battle scene i have ever seen.

"This movie was everything. Many people don't understand when you're invested into fictitious characters so much but the writers clearly do. They wrote the characters in such a human way it's amazing. Even the godly characters suddenly felt vulnerable. In all honesty, I cried like a b*tch I mean waileddd. Numerous trolls popped up in the internet and declared their hate of the movie but they're obviously trying to seek other people's attention and have that one minute fame thing. But after every negative comment I want you to think of this: this movie took character development to a whole new level, it took shock factor to a whole new level. It's been hours since I watched this movie yet I am still in shock and tears. The fact that a film can have this much effect on someone is crazy ,yet, it does. This is because the way they portrayed the characters is so phenomenal that one can't help but completely fall in love with them. If you are like me and you love these characters then I suggest you take a box of tissues with you. I have never been this saddened by a movie scene.",positive
I was not disappointed. I wouldn't be bored even if it was 5 hours!,positive
The Russo brothers did a bang up job wrapping up the entirety of what has become the MCU so far. The action scenes are very well done. The humor is admittedly hit-or-miss. But the acting from the all star cast (and there's a gigantic cast here) is very good. It includes some of the best character work in the MCU series in years. The final battle scene (shut up that's not a spoiler) is fan service galore. I think the concluding moments will be quite satisfying to many comics movie fans.,positive
"Amusing, but don't expect too much. The previous movie was much better.",positive

"It is overrated movie - and not in the same level as infinity war. I think the two movies could have been merged into one 3 hrs movie and spare us the hype of 13 years old fans all over the world.It is not worth it.Most of the parts are slow paced and dull, and the action sequences are not new or even surprising.Full of cinematic cliches.",negative

"While no rabid Marvel comic book fan, I can say I have enjoyed the Avengers and their journey. From individual films that fleshed out back story to them coming together and being the force needed has been one long memory I will cherish.Endgame was a true example of how to go out on top of your game. From the humor, the rich characters, the chemistry, the past (heartaches and joy), to the final minutes was a perfect mix and wild ride. It was a bittersweet ending. It did not need ""that particular scene"" to swell the emotions. The whole film was masterfully crafted with extra bits of care within the group.There were some flubs, sure.They did not detract from the story nor did they stand out. For me, it added to the ""human"" feels. As I said, this should become the gold standard for going out on top rather than a whimper across the finish line. Did not feel like 3 hours, it went by far too fast.If you don't see any other film this year, get to the theater for this one. It will engulf you and spirit you away from everyday.",positive
I am speechless.... This movie is so cool and yet I am sad that this marks the end of the Avengers.,positive

He's mischievous, sarcastic and has great character development -the perfect villain.However, seeing him in a new timeline from 'The Avengers' was very short but amazing. His sarcastic remark to Captain America after he was arrested really reminded us of his brilliant personality. I wish he got the chance to have a proper farewell but it wouldn't have fit in the dialogue very well so I really appreciate his final scenes. (Gotta love the face Loki pulled when the brief case was pushed by ant man and it slid on the floor 'by itself'.)Captain America - There's a lot to say on 'cap'. Captain America is a true loyal avenger. He never gave up he would always think of plans if one wasn't already thought of.Captain America fighting himself was brilliant. Fighting someone who was equal in power with the same fighting skills and weapons was not only great to see, but slightly hilarious in the sense that younger captain didn't know he was fighting himself.Seeing captain towards the end save Thor with his own hammer was a dream came true. The satisfaction of knowing that captain America turned out to be one of the most loyal avengers of all, not to mention brave. Seeing him hold that hammer made me very proud of what captain America became. He was once a small skinny boy and turned into a brave, heroic and loyal man.Seeing captain in the end as an old man was truly heart breaking to see his life at a near end but I was also happy knowing he finally had the life he had always wanted and let's be honest, he earned it.Seeing captain 'give' his shield away was also heart breaking in the moment but it also made me feel much better to know the legend is moving on and will never be forgotten. Part of me wished Bucky got the shield but I was still happy with the outcome.Hulk - now I can see some people being disappointed with how the hulk turned out. I wasn't. I thought having a hulk in control was very useful in battle seen as in 'infinity war' he was too scared to come out to fight the mad Titan, Thanos.Though seeing him taking selfies with fans was funny in the moment, it's a little too silly for the hulk in my opinion.Seeing hulk smash the car on top of the enemies and jumping on it angrily when they went back in time was funny because we got a final glimpse of the true hulk form and how aggressive he can be when out of control.Thor - people were disappointed with how Thor was treated, and I do agree somewhat. But it could've been worse. I mean they did remind us of how an asguardian drinks bear and eats all the time like shown in 'Thor'. Though as a Fortnite hater, I do think that was far fetched. We can see how Thor wanted to be himself.Speaking of Thor wanting to be himself, giving up his 'career' in being a king and giving it to an old friend 'Valkyrie'. I believe that was a good choice to give to her as she has shown the most enthusiasm whenever she is in battle, she has shown leadership previously too.Towards the final battle of the avengers and Thanos and his army Thor really showed the true power of Thor. Though I wished he would have been in a few more battle scenes. But I guess I can't complain as every avenger needed at least one scene in battle.Spider-Man - for a kid he was very very brave towards the end. At first before the movie released I was very disappointed in what they did to his suit. But seeing it in action I take it all back. Before the movie released all I could think about when I saw Spider-Man was how marvel had ruined his costume. After seeing the movie, I took one glance at it without negativity and never thought about it again until he opened his 4 back legs to break his fall. I didn't have anything bad to say about the costume throughout the whole movie.Having the switch from Spider-Man dying in-front of iron man to iron man dying in front of Spider-Man was truly heartbreaking.Spider-Man didn't have so many scenes and I wish he was here for more.Doctor strange - Came in last minute to bring everybody back which made the final fight EPIC! Seeing the avengers turning into a huge army was amazing! Though there's not a lot to say about doctor strange other than letting tony know what he had to do to stop Thanos. Other than that there's not much more to say. :(Black panther - I just loved T'Challa and his army. Very skill full. Black panthers fighting skills is one of my favourites just like Spider-Man he is fast and very slick when it comes to fighting running and jumping. To say we only see him fighting with his claws at a very short range. He is very brave.He played a big part in the final war bringing his army. In the end we know his father would've been very proud of him.antman - antman's panic after realising half the world is gone made us feel really scared for his family. I don't dislike antman but although he's a fairly new character in the movies we still feel for him when he reunited with his family. Through the movie he seemed very nervous and doubtful of the plan to save the world most of the time, but he still played a very important role. Without his idea of timetravel chances are, the avengers may not have saved the world.I was disappointed in the fact that we didn't see him fight much towards the final battle as we saw him grow huge and crush some people.Captain marvel - again, not in the movie much but came when the avengers needed her the most and that's what matters. I forgave her for leaving as it was true that every world lost people and needed a hero. So it was fair for her to leave. And also for plot reasons the movie would've been shortened if she was there the whole time.Guardians of the galaxy - seeing the team back together again and still standing strong made me very happy. Though we didn't see much battling with them it felt really nice to get them back into action. seeing star-lord knocked out and kicked in the nuts all in 1 movie felt great as there were a few times he was a jerk in movies. Funny and deserved every bit that he got. I don't hate starlord one bit but it was truly satisfying to see Gamora kick him in the nuts.As for nebula. It was so sweet of iron man to let her win the game in the beginning to let her experience the world of 'fun'. Future nebula was very loyal and have great character development, made me feel really nice inside when Tony held out his hand for her to shake for winning the game. I felt really bad for nebulas past. She did many bad things but that was because she feared Thanos, which was understandable. I completely forgive her for everything. Including sacrificing herself to save everyone. I still don't understand how nebula didn't disappear after killing the past nebula, maybe she survived? Who knows? Maybe a part of her lived? And Bruce fixes her and puts her back in time? Maybe?Hawkeye - seeing Hawkeye loose his family in the beginning was sad. After all he saved the world many times and just wanted a normal family life. After the disappearance of his wife and children seeing him turn into Ronin and go on a killing spree really makes us see how he feels.Trying to save Natasha a person in which he had been working with for a long time was truly sad after seeing how much they did together in other movies. Part of me wanted them to be a couple, but maybe thats just me? Having him protect the gauntlet was a little worrying because he in my opinion was the weakest avenger (doesn't mean I dislike him, he's one of my favourite avengers because of this) but it was a little worrying that he would loose the gauntlet. Thankfully he did not.Black widow - seeing her death gave me flashbacks of her time as a hero. Maybe one of the weakest avengers but she had a huge effect on the team. Seeing her crying in the beginning shows that Natasha has feelings in which she hides all the time to make herself look stronger than she was.Sacrificing herself to save others is what I call loyalty. It's sad that we don't know if she had any family left. My guess was that she didn't. But heating the avengers say that they were her family was very touching.Iron man - all this time I saw him as a billionaire who doesn't care about a lot of things. Seeing him sad for Spider-Man was one of the most amazing things to see of Tony.It was pretty obvious when he made that message on the ship at the beginning that he was going to die. It was also pretty obvious it was him though I kept denying it. Every movie he was in his arm would be hurt in some way in EVERY SINGLE MOVIE. So I expected that he would be the one to use the gauntlet.
At the end of the movie we saw a mysterious male. Who was this? This was the guy from iron man 3
Thanos - even with the gauntlet appeared to be weaker than infinity war Thanos Without the gauntlet. He spent minutes trying to take out iron man in Endgame. However, it took Thanos 30 seconds to defeat hulk in infinity war without the gauntlet. However, seeing Thanos sit and wait for the gauntlet to be given to him was a really good idea. He was so sure of himself that he won. Though he was wrong.The fact that Thanos gave up and sat down before he turned to dust makes us remember that he is not evil, he is loyal to his opinion on how the universe should run. Accepting his defeat instead of retaliating really showed this.Plot - As for the plot. There were many plot holes and the fact that the universe was saved by a rat is weird. However, I'm satisfied. Not perfect but nothing is.",positive
"I am so lucky to live in NZ where we got to see it on 24 April and I made sure I was at first screening to avoid spoilers. If you are a Marvel fan - I promise I will keep the #Don'tSpoilTheEndGame.
This is an emotional rollercoster - you will laugh (we cried of laughter at a few scenes), you will cry (so take tissues), you will hold your breathe, you will be on the edge of your seat and you will pump your fists.
3 hours fly and you will sit through the end credits trying to work out how you feel - emotionally drained but satisfied too I hope. Having watched all other movies in chronological order this month I am amazed at how this pulls all of the unknown as well as known loose strings together.
If you are new to Marvel world then you must watch Avengers:Infinity Wars first or this will not make sense.",positive
"Just saw this on the 26th. I'm reading all the negative reviews regarding pacing, worst movie ever, worse than Infinity Wars, etc.Someone else put it perfect, this is an EXTENSION of Infinity Wars. Don't go in comparing the two, just look at it as the 2nd half (what it really is, and perfect as such, imo). Infinity Wars and Endgame are a combined movie, split, in order to give fans more video. Enjoy that.Infinity Wars was the first movie that brought them all together, so that ""triumph"" is gone. I agree, the pacing was slow at points, but, to me, it's like a movie made from a book. Usually movies trim the fat, release the good parts, then watchers complain that certain ""small"" parts weren't in the movie. This is one of those ""extended"" versions that leaves almost everything in. There's just no book to compare it to. So, love the movie and the extra (slow pacing) bits, or move on.In the end, without spoilers, go in empty minded, without as much expectation as you can. I've watched every single Marvel film out and I loved this movie, even with the slow parts. I wasn't looking for anything particular, just a fan of the films, with a curiosity on how they will conclude it all. And boy, did they do that!It's not a ""10"" for thee ""perfect"" movie. But man, the audience was clapping, cheering, 'ooohs,' and 'ahhhhs' throughout. At times, I couldn't even hold myself back from the ""noooo fkn wayy, YES!!"" .Go in knowing that Marvel movies are ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS hyped. Don't expect. Just enjoy the roller coaster ride that is sooo much fun!!It's a 3-hour end to Infinity Wars and every bit of time, worth it, imo.",positive
"That's not fair with Thor and Hulk. They haven't done, what they known for
And I dnt knw why Captain Marvel was introduced, she has done nothing in the movie.",positive
Thank You Tony Stark For Every Thing And Rest In Peace woooow,positive
"The film was overall pretty well shot, but there were some things that made me frown upon.
In the first scene, where Clint loses his family, there is an hand-held shot, presumably, so that we can get the confusing and panic feeling that Barton felt. However, at the end of the scene, we go back to the wide shot used in the start of the scene, kind of dropping what the hand-held shot built up.
Some similar situations were reoccurring throughout the film. Situations where the camera seemed confused, giving different and ambiguous impressions about given scenes.The battle scene seemed utterly full of grandeur and splendor. It's sense of unity against Thano's tyranny was beautifully constructed to match moving pictures. One of the best CGI I have ever seen. From the tracking-shots following the glove to the shifting perspective each participant in the battle had, I had the feeling I was just enough inside the battle, while retaining the idea that I was only observing, having the conscience to judge the struggle of each and every character.As for the whole picture affair, I'd say Endgame deserves a good 8/10.
The plot and story, however, didn't feel as good.
First things first, it's something that has affected marvel for the past films. The disturbing likeness of some characters.
I feel like since ""Guardians of the galaxy"" and ""Deadpool"", Marvel has adopted the comedy side to super-heroes, as it has been something audiences have enjoyed. And although some characters already had it within their construction (Tony Stark, Peter Quill), some characters didn't.
I always remembered Thor as a character who was serious and traditional, behaving almost like a medieval prince. But since Ragnarok, he feels like a goofball.
I feel like this is not shared by many, but it is something that has bugged me.
Going afoot from here, I also don't feel very comfortable around how Hulk evolved. I always felt like Bruce was a genuinely nice guy, balancing his intelligence and awkwardness. And now he feels like an all-feel-good vegan millennial trying his best at his new job.
It feels like a sudden try to connect with younger generations, bringing odd behaviors through the wrong characters.Following, there is the issue with all the ""time-travel"" burp plot.
It all seemed so random, so out of focus and reasoning. I think I understood what went on. But during the film it all looked like it was justified by a ""just because"".But a lot of characters just feel rushed and messy. The feel like they lack traits of their own. A significant portion of the plot feels saturated and out of goals. Throughout the middle of the movie I found myself disconnected from it all.In the end, I'd say the plot and story goes for a 6/10.Balancing the two, I'd say the film's fine for a 7/10.",positive
This is a replica of guardian of galaxy. Too boring to watch.,negative
"Avengers:Endgame lacks the pace that infinity war had and some defining moments and storylines may seem a bit stretched. But with stunning visuals, staggering emotions, incredible acts and a satisfying end makes it something to be experienced.",positive
This movie is soo good.i like this movie i am big fan this movie.happy watching,positive
"This movie was made for the fans of the mcu who has been following the movies for years. If i could describe it, its a fitting ending for the all the movies we've seen so far. Lots of nostalgia moments, lots of callbacks from previous films. As a fan, i felt they delivered. We got a ending we deserve. Act 3 was amazing, audience was rowdy for the final battle. I haven't went back to the theatres to watch a movie again since rotk. I feel as a fan, and what the mcu has provided me for the last 10 years, i should support the movie again.",positive
"Omg, this movie could not have been a greater ending to this phase. All the epic moments like when Cap lifts Mjolnir and did get lighting powers. Profesor Hulk was also a great way to make hulk/Banner. Now i come to the end Battle (OMG). It was so epic when Wong and Dr Strange openee the portels, army of Wakanda, Asguardiens, Wizards and all the Avengers that went into dust in IW. In the end i cried when Tony died, he was after all the person that saved everyone and won over Thanos. I had also it coming when old man Cap appeared. The most chocking thing was Black Widow Death. This movie was the best ending and i am happy to have been a part of the marvel movies since Iron man 1 came. Thanks.",positive
"I am one that hates to see sequels because they all seem to let you down, however, Avengers: Endgame delivered on the spot. It's thrilling, adventuresome, full of nail-biting excitement, happy one moment and then... sad and tearful as well. This movie is worth the time and money you spend to see it. After Endgame, I do wonder how the Avenger's sequels/new story lines will be like... even still, I am a fan!
(its a much better movie than a lot of mess coming out of Hollywood these days).",positive
"This last avengers movie is epic, everything is just fantastic except of course the finale :(
don't reveal the events of the movie, this movie deserves to be no.1 of all movies.",positive
"The film is extremely draggy but with good reason (the leading up and ending). After all, this is the end of the Avengers franchise. Direction, production value, acting, etc etc was all top notch.The only thing i was pretty let down about was the script/screenplay. Just very repetitive, straight forward, no twists, no wow moments (except the ending) and using the same dramatic music was a bit cliche. But in retrospect, i understand. They did the best they could do given what they were dealt.This must have been a very emotional movie to conclude for the whole cast and crew given by the extremely long good bye. I commend everyone for a fantastic job.",positive
"Loved the previous one more, nonetheless this was a great movie, it was wonderful to see the future meets the past. Yay for the avengers all the way",positive
"The movie was entertaining, but so many missing details In the story. I did not like the ending as well",positive
"This movie reminds me of ""Back to The future 2"" like doc said, ""don't run into your other self"" and the ending reminded me of ""Inception"" everyone ends up in their own alternate reality. I probably won't watch this movie for a very long time and it's 2 hours of boring-ness. And maybe 45 minutes of action, and the rest of it was cheesy, I just couldn't get teary eyed at the end. Mediocre at best. Btw ""Captain Mar-Vel"" wasn't really relevant and had little screen time, maybe 20-25mins. And Thor is FAT. The end. Glad I didn't waste my own money on this movie.",negative
IT was fantastic but the idee with the time travel was so wanted. But was a very nice movie.,positive
"The film is harmonious and consistent. Each hero is a cog of a large mechanism. Emotional background rolls over. Amazing completion of the saga. Where is the end, there is the beginning of something new.",positive
"This is not at all a perfect movie. It has way too many plot holes and unanswered questions. But you can't deny that something like this has never been done in history, like having a 22 movie franchise within a span of 11 years, all interconnected and hitting the right emotions. For the people complaining about character development, you had almost spent 10 years with these characters. This is not a standalone movie and should not be seen as one. It is not meant for critis or awards, It is meant for fans. Not just movie fans but mainly Comic book fans. People complaining about hulk and in this movie should know that there are more than one green raging hulk in the comics and you are not less worthy of anything and thor showed that you are not less worthy even if you are internally broken and don't need to have a body like The Rock to be a superhero.
I don't believe that it's a theme park, but I respect your opinion if you do.",positive
"I laughed, I cried, it was an amazing ride. Admittedly, Endgame is not as strong as Infinity War but, it is a wonderful experience. This movie is heavy. The emotional content is appropriate for a film entitled ""Endgame."" You will be overwhelmed by the feels in this one. The CGI is top notch, and as usual in Marvel movies, a flawless cocktail of humor and action fill the screen. There is less action than I initially expected but more than enough to satisfy the average(too bad I'm not the averagw). Cheering is an uncontrollable side effect when watching the events unfold. There are some surprises that will make your jaw drop. This one comes highly recommended from me. It's a visual spectacle. In order to help manage expectations, it is not as powerful as ""Infinity War."" In my humble opinion, very few movies are as deeply exciting as I.W. As a continuation, and an ending to an era, it's solid to say the least. #seeit",positive
"This movie had me crying, laughing, gasping and completely mesmerised from start to finish. It was worth the wait, it was full of things I did not expect and some things I did, which is good too!
I honestly loved it and I'm going to go back and watch it again.
YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.",positive
"Just watched Avengers Endgame at the cinema and OH anyone who is watching this is in for a real three hour treat, which has lots of twists and turns along the way. All I will say about this movie is this is the Endgame that you will never predict any fan theories fly out the window as you are going to get properly mind blown as it would be one of the last endings that you would expect. If you thought Infinity War had you scratching your heads full of theories, well endgame just blows out the window and who knows what will happen next. All I say is I would definitely recommend watching this awesome movie as there will be funny parts and a lot of emotionally challenging scenes and a lot of action like the typical Marvel Movies we know and love, nevertheless you will find that you will not be disappointed I definitely recommend watching it as there will be many more MCU Movies to come to explain the aftermath of this movie. I cannot wait to see more Marvel Movies as I am so impressed on how the screen play writers has constructed this incredible universe of stories and how well it has been portrayed by the incredible very hugely talented actors in this film by new actors and returning actors alike they have all done a brilliant job Well Done And Congratulations.",positive
"Hear me out i think that there aren't any acting flaws, there are great moments, great action and it finished alot of character arks but the whole time travel premise feels stiff and it's hard to sit down and watch a three hour film that is so slow to start, overall fine but not as great as infinity war.",positive
"Amazing how Marvel has created this cinematic universe. So many good stories, all connected. This movie was long but great to watch.",positive
"Mixture of events. Great effort.
There was no need for that sad ending. They just did it to finish the series.
It HAS AFTER CREDIT SCENES.
Pay close attention to the sound you hear there ;-)",positive
"Just too long with too many characters each having on average 10 minutes of screen time. Plot meanders between past (5 years supposedly but even more in one or two scenes quite contrary to expectation) and present with tongue in cheek nod to titles of movies made previously about time travel (back to the future etc). The physics behind time travel is given a pat explanation with the audience expected to swallow some line about how the nature of time changes at the quantum level.
Why is time travel a big deal in this movie? Because mostly everything that is done in the last Avengers film is reversed (with the loss of only a couple of main characters this time around) and Marvel fans can look forward to seeing more of their favorite action heroes in the future. To me, the entire plot is a cop out. Going by this some further plot twist in the next Marvel movie will see the revival of the characters who die in this film.
The acting is mediocre with many of the main characters hamming it up as if on a vacation especially Hemsworth as Thor.
The critics love this movie and it's a global smash hit. To be fair i'm not part of that demographic that is sold on superheroes but I did enjoy black panther and the first Thor film. But this film is about 60-70 minutes too long and can be a strain on the nerves.",negative
"An epic end to the this Infinity Saga..It couldn't have been any better..To all those fans around the globe who have been waiting for this moment. I have to say this is worth Ur wait, this is the moment, this is the Endgame",positive
"This movie is very cool because the cast is very talented it's made of Chris Evans, Robert doney jr .This movie was so incredible and so funny because the cast is very funny and great. The story and the plot were intelligent. The fightings were really great and i like when there is a lot of action .The movie is produced for marvel and i like this movie because it talks of superheros, phisik, and science fiction. If you like superheros movie you must watch Avengers Endgame.",positive
"Avengers - Endgame offers a stunning and moving ending.
There are times to laugh, but also times to cry. Many did at the end.
Thank you Marvel.",positive
"I am not a typical science fiction movie fan but i love movie as long as it has good story, graphics and can make me feel become part of movie.After having watched Endgame i was literally in shock due to emotions i felt. even a sane person like me who know the difference between real life and reel life cried, smiled, laughed and man!! those goosebumps i felt during some science where Avengers get hope of success were incredible.Yes i agree first part of movie was not that fast but it was great since it built a pavement for bigger building, and also make us feel how heartbroken a man feel when he fails to save his loved once after trying everything. It make me realize the importance of loved one in my life.As a movie it is perfect. But i am sad that it ended.story line of movie without spoiling movieHopelessness/abject sadness -> hope -> courage -> sad -> hope -> courage + fun -> honor -> valor -> sad -> hopeAnd at last i love you 3000",positive
Worth every Dime and so much more. Make sure you pee before the movie starts. You won't want to miss a scene. This Movie is everything!!! The excitement is what you will get on every scene. Major Surprise and no I will not be a Spoiler. More like a Celebration of Living the best life in the Movie Theater 🍿🥂🍿🎥🎬,positive
Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. Respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. An experience you'll gonna remember forever.,positive
"Steve's character has always been about self-sacrifice, from the very first movie, from his very first heroic moment that led to his becoming Captain America. His whole life is defined by doing the right thing, fighting, and saving (and sacrificing if he has to in the process of saving). Don't get me wrong: I love him and I want him to get his happy ending. But the way it is done, it just feels wrong for the character. How did we get from the Steve of all previous movies, basically, to the Steve of the end of Endgame? He went back to Peggy and had a happy and peaceful life, stayed out of all major world events and injustices for 70 years. How is that the Captain America we know and love?! There is a major development arc missing from his storyline; the same way there was a major development arc missing to expalin how he finally got worthy of Mijolnir... As a whole, Steve's character was rather flat in Endgame. What did he learn? How did he change and grow? It's not that characters have to change and evolve in every episode of a series, but such development was strongly implied when it comes to Steve Rogers in Endgame, although we never see it on the screen. The whole episode starts with Tony's accusations--so that scene was just about Tony?? What was Steve's response?--and ends with his getting worthy... how? Hmmm, how did a storyline giving my favorite MCU character all he supposedly wanted leave me so empty and unmoved? I hope the Russo brothers will get to write the jumping-between-timelines explanation they have mentioned and explain what actually happened there...Tony... After everything he's done for the world... After the glimpse we got into a happy retired family-man life for him... he deserved better. He had a plan, a family. He could have been happy without being a superhero from now on. Why couldn't he get that peace and happiness? He had grown enough over the course of the movies to finally be ready for it. I hope they'll bring him back.Alternatively, they could have let Steve sacrifice (go back in time and take Tony's place, for example) and Tony live happily with his family... It would have been painful, dramatic, and in character. I don't buy the whole Tony-was-incapable-of-self-sacrifice ""character development"" argument, when he risked his life over and over again to save the world. Last time he did was in Infinity War when he was so disappointed Dr. Strange didn't let Thanos kill him.Same with Natasha and Clint. What was the point of Nat sacrifing? If Clint had died, it would have been seen as character development and would have probably led to Natasha's further character development. Natasha's death didn't contribute to anyone's development. It was just a plot device. Therefore, just bring her back, too, and be done with character deaths in Endgame--it's a dumb trope, anyway...",positive
Just amazing. The humour combined with the emotional turmoil makes this one of the greatest films ever. I didn't think there could be a fight scene as intense as infinity war...I was wrong. Just amazing!,positive
"I wasn't that keen on ENDGAME, there... I said it. I went into this film with high expectations (thanks to all the hype/money it's made/phenomenon that was INFINITY WAR) and was rather let down. There were two real problems with this movie: 1) it's WAY too long and subsequently becomes rather unfocused on reaching it's conclusion. 2) it is just plain BORING for it's opening 2 hours and a half! There's no material that grips me/makes me say ""wow"", unlike INFINITY WAR which blew my socks off within the first 10 minutes.There are several plot lines that are both uninteresting and unnecessary. I'm all up for character-building, but do we need much more character-building after 15 WHOLE MOVIES, and does it really have to take up 2 AND A HALF HOURS OF SCREEN TIME?!! I don't mind a film needing a build-up but this was quite frankly RIDICULOUS, especially when (despite being 2 hours and 40 minutes) INFINITY WAR cut to the chase pretty quickly while still making us feel for the characters.However, to say that ENDGAME was a total loss would be untrue. The final quarter/ending of the movie will leave you awestruck and sad! It's a brilliant ending that fires on all four cylinders, so it's just a shame that the rest of the movie had to be so tedious/unnecessarily stretched-out!",positive
All i can say is for us Thor fans this movie was the ultimate slap in the face. apart from a couple scenes that shone...the rest was absolute garbage. i can comfortably say Infinity war was way better and garbage is a movie im 100% sure i will never watch again in my life. And Ive never said that about a movie. Dont believe the hype and don't waste your money.,negative
"Mildest of spoilers
An amazing saga of superhero movies culminates to this Endgame. It starts slow, picks up pace, then explodes in your face as a chain of events you feel are too quick to handle and finally gives 2 massive blows to your puny guts. Definitely at least 4 edge-of-the-seat moments at the end.But a lot of unanswered questions remain at the end of movie especially relating to time travel and how it affects the characters.It was a great movie with a massive cast, plot, music score and execution, but Infinity war had some really epic moments like - Thor's entrance - to make it a masterpiece, and Endgame lacked that sort of roaring twists.Nevertheless, you and I both will watch the movie at least 2 more times to digest and let it grow on us. Enjoy it, bring tissues.The love is always 3000.",positive
"AVENGERS : ENDGAMEA Humongous tribute to the characters Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) for being a vital part in Marvel Cinematic Universe.Never seen such a huge franchise paying a proper payoff to these characters.Do not watch Endgame untill you watch all the marvel films starting from Ironman to Infinity war.First half of the movie travels at a slower pace because this flick contains a phenomenal story and character arc built for the powerpacked other half.Different dimensions of Capt'n and Thor characters were shown to the audience. Which will keep the them excited throughout the movie.Directors Russo brothers came up with an epic cinematic ending. The determination and conviction for such a complex screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen Mcfeely has to be appreciated.We as an audience would have presumed that this film would end in a certain way. But, there are lot other Easter eggs and jaw dropping scenes which excites us and also make us whimper.Overall, with Avengers : Endgame, there is really something that comes to an end. BTW keep your tissues handy!!",positive

"After 11 years and 21 films the end has came and it's a glorious conclusion to this amazing saga. Avengers endgame is probably the best superhero movie and marvel movie ever made in my opinion this movie is absolutely amazing and not like anything you have seen in a superhero movie. Avengers endgame is amazing and just a fantastic film to witness. This is gonna be a hard film to do a spoiler free review of but after a couple weeks of it being out I well post a spoiler talk. Here's my spoiler free review for avengers endgame.
Pros- the acting in this movie is amazing and probably the best acting you have ever seen in the mcu yet everyone gives there best performance in the mcu yet. The characters are amazing and just great. Thanos again is an amazing villain and just a pure threat like in infinity war. The music wow is just amazing I can't stop playing the score it's just an amazing score and the movies music that they used fits so well. The action is just awesome and pure superhero magic. The story is awesome and just something to behold. There is never a dull moment.
Cons: I don't have any.
Overall- avengers end game is an amazing conclusion to the this saga. In my opinion it's the best superhero movie ever made and best mcu movie go see this movie as soon as possible. Avengers endgame gets a 10/10.",positive
Loved it to bits. Saw it twice in one day. Perfect ending to the infinity saga and cant wait to see what is next.,positive
I would agree with critics saying its a bit too hyped and overrated movie.Doesnt live upto my expectations. Sorry,positive
"After some time had passed in the theatre, I had a split moment of panic, because, why, I was wondering about the time! And what does that mean? I was not engaged in the movie as much as I should have been.Endgame was not a bad movie, no. It was a decent one, and I think it's as a fulfilling end to this era of MCU as it can be. But, this movie had flaws, flaws that many fanboys and fangirls are too willing to overlook but I just can't.Here I use Infinity War as my measuring stick, because it is one of my all-time favourite films, and personally I think it is one of the best superhero films ever made. No words can possibly describe the sweet, excruciating, soul-crushing devastation I felt when I walked out of the theatre watching IW for the first time. I don't know if a film can ever have that same effect on me ever again.One of my main problems with Endgame was the pacing. I loved the first part depicting the depressing state of the world after the snap, however, the next part of the film - the time heist - could use some huge improvements. There seemed to be no time nor preparation at all between the assemble and the execution of the heist. I personally think jokes were injected at some pretty inappropriate times, amongst other reasons that nullified scenes that were supposed to be serious and emotional. I often found my emotion deflated just as it was about to overflow, leaving me quite disappointed. IW did a spectacular job at balancing humour and emotions and I felt every rush and devastation to my very core. Take the scene at Vormir from both films as an example. Whereas IW had me cry like a baby, Endgame felt like it was just getting it done to me.Another thing that grated on me terribly was the fact that this entire film only happened because a mouse, yes, a bloody mouse somehow ran over the correct combination of buttons to release Antman. That's purely lazy writing at its finest. Endgame had similar conveniences threading through it, though none bothered me as much as this one.Finally, the time travelling fiasco. Time travelling is a grief to any film. Endgame, like most films, did not manage to evade the consequences of its complexity. I understand the Russo brothers want this to be the desired, the deserved ending for the Avengers, yet in the process they have unfortunately created a forced one as well.I need to make my point clear once again: Endgame was a decent film and ultimately a fitting conclusion to the emotional journey. Yet, as an independent film, it has many flaws and perhaps is not worth the acclaim it is receiving.And Infinity War is infinitely better, sue me.",positive
"I've seen every marvel movie and the Russo brothers ones are my lest favorites, I think civil war is almost unwatchable. So my expectations weren't too high but I'll say I liked this one the best of their MCU movies. The movie was probably a bit too long, action was fine and emotions/humanity bit was good. My few issues are :
1) Thor (major problem) - I love Thor and Hemsworth and they just had to ruin him . The fat drunken bit could have been fine for a few minutes but to keep him that way the whole movie ! It's the last movie with all the originals and everyone else gets big hero moments and looking good and they just destroyed him - my fury rages2) final Thanos fight - I get wanting to show off everyone but makes no sense to have Thor and Wanda and captain marvel (Who either killed or almost did or fought well against Thanos when he had the stones ) and now not one could take him out, Wanda who should be one of the most powerful could barely break his armor3) the time travel bits were ok (and poorly handled time travel can be a pet peeve of mine) but those few instances like thanos leaving the past or where Loki escaped definitely couldn't have put those right so now those are alternate timelines / realities ???Other than the Thor butchering it was pretty good",positive
"Waste of time! Don't watch it, your 3 hourse is not Worth it",negative
"Absolutely loved the Endgame. A perfect and a satisfying end to an epic saga. It exceeds your highest expectations with too many pleasant surprises. An experience you will remember forever. The final hour of the movies is a perfect masterpiece filled with goosebumps, excitement tears. A new benchmark has been set for the upcoming superhero movies.",positive
"Great finale!Directing, special effects, scenography, music just as the end of a story should be. Great for science fiction fans like me.",positive
"This was a breathtaking and amazing movie. It's a wonderfully filmed movie, and it proves, in my opinion, again, that Marvel has aced it again, dominating DC. It isn't your typical action-packed superhero movie that's cheesy and is only about getting the villains. It shows meaning, and it shows how far they've come, how much they are willing to save their people. It made me cry...when they all charged out from the portals, and it made me tearful when there were lost ones. It was breathtaking, really, it is one of my favorite films by far, and it is full of amazing scenery, and action, and amazing music, with a beautiful passage behind. It was truly very meaningful...and this is why I want to remember Stan Lee forever, and Marvel itself. Everyone has done amazing acting, and it truly warms my heart to see how far everyone has come. Marvel makes a change in everyone's lives. This was the movie I was most excited for this year, and I was not disappointed. It went even higher than my expectations. Even higher. And even though there might be sad woes, it is true and hits back home, and it will leave you speechless.",positive
"This is a movie thats really worth your time, especially the final fight. I don't want to spoil the movie but its worth 3 hours of your time",positive
"Well, the magnificent saga ends with a such great and satisfying conclusion which gives you the best cinematic experience of your life. Unexpected, brilliant and an all together masterpiece.",positive
"This is one of the greatest action/sci-fi movies I have ever seen. Amazing emotional ride, great acting, amazing CGI, the best of the bests made an honorable ending of an amazing era. And we could be a part of it. This is how you end an amazing series this is how you make an action/sci-fi movie this is 110% professionalism. Generation Z grew up on watching these movies, these movies are their Star Wars. MARVELous work.Thank you.",positive
"The first time I watched this movie, I was really annoyed by it and even disappointed, it didn't live up to MY expectations but after a second and a third or so watch, it gets better and even picked up some tiny details that I missed the first I watched it. I still have some problems with it tho;
The hulk was a little disappointing, we don't see him at all in Infinity War and they are almost building to this big event where we will finally meet the Hulk and maybe even get a rematch with Thanos but unfortunately, we didn't get any of it, instead we get Hulk, now Professor Hulk in a diner in a such an anticlimactic way. would have loved to have watched how he became Professor Hulk.
I loved Thor, I know it's not how we are used to seeing him but once you consider his story arc, dude's been through a lot; loses his brother, father, mother, hammer, home, half of his people, sister, eye and even his hair haha. It kinda make sense why he just locked himself away. The humor in Ragnorak kinda ease the pain Thor's going through, so he's chubby now....... but still a badass.
I'm still in the air about Cap staying in the past, I like that he finally found happiness but don't like how he just up and left.
I was not a fan of the whole women's moment in the final battle, it was kinda forced truth be told. Most of them had no previous connection whatsoever, not even an exchange of dialogue, so to see them like that all of a sudden, was very cringey. Moreover, Captain Marvel doesn't need help, she's the only character that could get through the army alone without breaking a sweat, would have preferred to see Shuri or Hope have the Gauntlet and then everyone back them up.
The end battle was chaotic and hard to follow, The CGI while it's excellent, it was overused in the sequences, and some character interaction wasn't that necessary.
The screentime is not balanced at all, there's too many scenes with the original Avengers and the first half of the movie is basically just talking, and the comedy ran its course a little bit.
I've got a mixed feeling about the time travel, but then there's not way it's going to be that there won't be a plot hole, time travel is complicated so I'm okay with how it played out here.Thanos is a bit one-dimensional and rougher than the Thanos we saw in Infinity War but he's still memorable as ever, his lines are still chilling. All thanks to Josh Brolin for bringing this wonderfully likable villain to life, no one could have done a better job.
There were really emotional moments like Black Widow sacrificing herself for the greater good, Ironman's selfless sacrifice, Thor with his mother, Tony and Peter hugging, Steve and Peggy finally getting that dance, Those scenes were really moving.And some funny moments; like Scott's age transformation when testing the time machine, Thor saying ""you take the little one"" to Cap, Thor and Quill's ""who's in charge"" scene, and almost all scenes with Thor and Antman and Quill......and rocket!Cool moments like Cap picking Mjnoir and fighting with Thanos with it, Captain Marvel's arrival during the battle, Cap saying ""Avengers assemble"", The trio fight with Thanos, and all the dusted Avengers coming through the portal etc
All in all, The direction is good, CGI is brilliant of course, acting's better than ever, score is evacotive.I personally prefer Infinity War to this, but I think it's a pretty satisfying conclusion to this incredible franchise, okay maybe not the franchise conclusion yet but it still tidied up the story arc of many characters and the Gauntlet/infinity Stones storyline nicely.",positive
"Avengers EndGame Is Literally The Definition Of A True SuperHero Movie , From Hilarious Moments To Truly HeartBreaking Moments To A Final Act And And Finish That Will Blow Your Mind. This Is Simply A Must Watch ... One Of The Greatest Movies Of All Time , The End Is Here And The End Is ""MARVEL""OUS !!!",positive
"Would be great if adam warlock was in it. Nice movie, nothing more, nothing less. Maybe too much expectations.",positive
"First 90 minutes was boring, sulking around, listless, no action.The action was compressed into the last 8 minutes and was just a 'showcasing' of many MCU superheros, as though they needed schmaltz and sadness as a plot point. Nothing epic came to play, no appearances of any surprise characters (like Galactus), or any surprises at all, and the twists were pointless (Black Widow and Ronin both trying to sacrifice themselves then swapping back and forth).There was a lot of promise and possibility but I think the screenwriters just phoned it in, predictable and tedious.Rewatchability? About 2/10. I don't think I'll bother watching it again. Why?I can't believe the 1,244 people who gave this a 10. They're delusional",negative
Overall A Plus movie ending 4 out of 5 root 5 out of 5 intensity 5 out of 5 connectivity 5 out of 5 scores and soundtracks 5 out of 5 screenplay five out of five cinematography 5 out of 5 character development 5 out of 5 story 5 out of 5,positive
"Avengers endgame is kind of a ""sweet gift"" from marvel studios to all marvel fans around the world who have been faithful in terms of following the franchise since it was released first on 2008.10 years of workhard, never dissapointing. Avengers endgame is a kind of a ""indirect communication"" between the director and the fans, on how thankful they are for having them.Avengers endgame, undoubtly, is a work made by heart.",positive
Overall great movie just some boring dialogue in between,positive
"Its have emotion, fun,war,love and more ...
When I watch the movie that was my feall,its bern a fantastic movie. Evry one is fantastic but i must say Robert Dawney jr deserve oscer for best supporting actor category.",positive
"It is a good movie, don't go with super high expectations, the movie delivers for sure but however, it is upsetting. I loved it honestly. It is very emotional one, I felt for everyone in this movie. Expect some confusions in this movie.",positive
No other words need be spoken. No idea when/if we will see another build up of this caliber.,positive
"The movie was good but I think the 9 rating is to high... It was very predictable.. And I believe many other MCU movies had A better story
Don't give me wrong it's a great movie and fun to watch.. Just not a 9 er rating
And it has many not awnsered questions and things that makes no sense.. Infinity war was much better...",positive
I don't wanna spoil it... Just like to say that RDJ I LOVE YOU and the whole crew infinte...,positive
A thing I don't get is 2 things why at the last scene of the movie why did captain America chose to go back into the past and stay there with his well wife but pegge is dead why would you fool with it why answer is simple marvel is a fool movie company now A DAYS and last thing why did black widow chose to die instead of hawkie black widow doenst deserve to die guess who does hawkie does because hawkie hasn't been in marvel movies forever and black widow has its a rip no one honestly should see it its a rip moreLY to me that infinity war is on Netflix it shouldn't,positive
"Marvel, since under Disney management, fails in innovating and goes for the safe route of recycling its blockbusters. The movie feels like a weird mix of burger, pizza, skittles and Ben&Jerries. Very disappointing of Marvel.",negative
"Omg it was awesome... I went yesterday at 10:30 at night to see it.. I have to say after 21. Films I can't believe this is the final movie.... I was happy felt like crying towards the end, existed so many emotions within a period of 3 hours... I have to say I even stroked with a couple of people next to me talking about it... I loved it the end scene at the end was the best... in my opinion between Chris Evans (Captain America) and Chris Hemsworth (Thor). I loved it I still can't believe it has come to and end... I keep thinking maybe the actors Chris Evans would change his mind and come back to the awesome Marvel movies...
I also loved Brie Larson I just wish she would have had more screen time... I thought she worked well with an ensembled cast... I love Mark Ruffalo (hulk)
And Scott Lang (Antman) great comedy Relief....
If you are a marvel fan like me I urge you to see it I don't know like 10 times I loved it.... I might go again and watch it...👍",positive
"I don't care what anyone says, this is the best film I have ever seen period. Maybe the plot wasn't the best and some things could've been improved upon but the overall film was amazing. I have never had an experience as good as the first time I watched endgame and I doubt I ever will again. It will makes you laugh, and cry guaranteed.",positive
Too be honest I didn't think marvel could top what they did in infinity war but they have just exceeded expectations and brought out the biggest and greatest movie I have ever watched,positive
"Film was fun, but in the end I got tired. xD Maybe I'm getting too old to sit for 3h straight.Thank you, it's been a pleasure!",positive
"Every time I watch this movie, I'm reminded of how amazing it is. The action, the characters are all great. It's truly the EndGame.",positive
"You must have already seen it, or you would see it this weekend.Or you will see it this month, in worst case you may see it next month.But you will see this movie at least once in your life, it's just that good.",positive
"I liked this movie but was super disappointed. Good for the Russo brothers to build up Infinity War and have the ending like they did in that movie with people waiting a whole year to see what happens and this is what they presented us? That's why it's really hard to make a movie about time travel. I may have missed how they explain it in the movie but I thought if you did something in the past, it affects the future? I'll explain later. They both made Hulk and Thor as laughing stocks. So here are a couple things I noticed that were plot holes.1) WHAT HAPPEN TO LOKI?
So where was Loki in the final battle? But most importantly, where did he go when he took the Tesaract when Tony was having that ""seizure""? I guess when Cap and Tony went back to 1970 to take it from that army base, than should the first avengers movie didn't happen at all?2) CAPTAIN AMERICA PART OF HYDRA?
When Cap was in the elevator with the Hydra goons, he whispered ""Hail Hydra"". So now all those guys would think Captain is part of Hydra3) THE FINAL SNAP
This one has left me very confused. I understand that the plot of the whole movie was that the avengers would have to collect all the stones and do another snap to bring back the other half of the universe back to life. They accomplished just that. But earlier in the movie did Thanos snap again to destroy the stones? That being said, Tony sacrificed himself to snap his hand that had the stones to destroy Thanos and his army? Why just him and his army?All in all, I still thought it was a ok movie and I'll watch it hundreds of times in the future but just a little disappointed.",positive
MY MOST FAVORITE FILM!!! Who left a mark on my heart forever. All the best actors united in one masterpiece. I advise everyone to watch it for any evening in the circle of close people with their favorite drinks and goodies.,positive
"Being a marvel fan I was very excited to watch it. This turned out to be little disappointing. Still enjoyable, but I think "" infinity war"" was way way good.",positive
"Let me first tell you that I am a big fan of the marvel movie franchise. Never read any comic book. I generally enjoy superhero movies.This review would be disliked but I have to say this, this was the worst marvel movie after iron Man 2 for me. Some movies have loopholes in their script but this movie has some script in the loopholes.
I guess this movie is getting such high reviews(near fight club and Lord of the rings) as people are emotional about the characters and they would think with their heart and not their brain. But if you actually think about the movie, that is , take your brain with you to the theatre, you would start observing the huge loopholes.
And I do want to clear it out that I am not a person who is very picky about the story. I accept some flaws in a movie. But in this movie there are so many flaws that it becomes hardly acceptable.
It was so bad that it killed all my interest in future superhero movies.",negative
"No Spoilers here, just go see it, It is the best movie ending TO ONE OF OF THE GREATEST MOVIE SERIES EVA",positive
"You broke my heart and fixed it again! You took me to heaven and hell! The future and thankfully the passed! My biggest hope for this movie came true! I really wanted more than anything for the captain to make right the wrongs that had happen to his life! You made that happen! Thank you!
Epic truly Epic! Here's to new beginnings",positive
"It's so hard to review something that I feel that every fan felt on such an emotion level - it's definitely something you just have to go and experience for yourself.it's very good - you'll laugh, you'll cry, it'll change your life.",positive
"What a perfect ending for avengers series, very emotional and enjoyable to watch, for the events some could be a pit better but it's very good overall.",positive
"Everything was unexceptuble i mean wooooww
And the final battle amazed mee and made me cry a loot",positive
"I promised myself I would not watch anymore Marvel movies after Infinity War because I was upset Infinity War could have ended in one movie with an extra thirty minutes like they added to this movie, but they split the movie into two movies without informing the audience to make more money and to introduce new characters into the universe. I kept my promise until I got a chance to see this movie and I gave the movie a chance. I was very impressed with this movie. It was a love letter to the diehard fans who have been with the franchise since the beginning. Every character gets their moment to shine. The characters who you figured were leaving the franchise had a satisfying send-off which made you smile at times and other times made you sad. I didn't cry watching this movie, but I laughed and smiled a lot. Thanos was a great movie villain and every time he made an appearance onscreen you could feel his intimidating presence. I loved Capt. in the third act of the movie and there is one epic moment when you gasp in excitement. And yes, I think it's a callback to that hilarious scene in Avengers: Age of Ultron. I really enjoyed this movie again. It was the older generation passing the torch to the younger generation while original Avengers received a proper sendoff and closed the chapter to the final installment of the phase one and opened the door to the next chapter of Marvel movies. There is one big question left unanswered; but seeing Spiderman 2 coming out this summer, I think we'll get the answers. The only con in this movie is Captain Marvel. She doesn't fit in. She is like the Iron Fist of the Marvel Movie Universe. She stands out like a sore thumb and I think Disney is going to turn her into a LBGT character and force her on the audience or shame fans if who don't accept her. Like I expected she was an ex machina character and I was so happy she was hardly in the movie besides a handful of scenes. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie. It was a fun ride and proper conclusion to phase one.No, this movie was not any Dark Knight Trilogy or movie masterpiece but it was entertaining and fun and answered your questions and answers and left the audience with a satisfying conclusion like all the time and energy you spent on these movies were worthwhile. In what I believe to be his final movie cameo, I think the godfather of Marvel himself, Stan Lee, would have been proud with the final product of this movie. Excellent movie you should definitely check out and enjoy.",positive
"The film was recommended to me by a colleague. He said he had tears in his eyes at the end.Well, I also had tears in my eyes. But that was mainly due to the bad film.The film lasts 3 hours, so the film starts slowly without ever getting into the tempo later.Especially the ""Woke"" elements, which damage the story, attracted attention:Thor is fat, a pitiful, beer-drinking joke figure: The God of Thunder, the symbol of masculinity, castrated. A black (!) Valkyrie, which nobody knows, will lead the Asen in the future. The Asen are a Nordic dynasty of gods. Africans are sought in vain. Moreover, Valkyries are not gods, so they cannot lead the gods. Only in Hollywood.In the decisive battle, the focus is on seven women. Remember, women are the better fighters. Although they don't match reality, they are still sold.The rescue comes of course from Captain Marvel, who can do everything and from the African superheroes from Black Panther. Strong!But also the story doesn't offer anything new! Besides, the battle is ridiculous, like the other Marvel battles before it. Neither exciting, nor gripping, nothing at all.Let's see what comes next. New heroines against evil white men.",positive
What An Awesome Movie I Really Enjoyed It One Of The Best Movies of The Year,positive
"Infinity war is way way way better than end game.i didn't like the story that much. expected much more, i am not satisfied.",positive
"The fact that this movie still has a 9.2 rating really says a lot about the fans. They must either be 10, or have extremely low movie standards.Also, the unnecessary and overwhelming immature jokes gave me cancer.",negative
"11 years. 21 (now 22) films. They did it. And so much more.Every (positive) review you've already read about this conclusion is true. You'll laugh, cry, cheer, gasp, and yell for 181 minutes... which does not feel at all like 181 minutes. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun at the movies.Not only did Marvel brilliantly manage the job of ending this saga, they also conquered the Herculean challenge of touching on all 21 previous installments (yes, really) in completely appropriate fashion. Mostly all the things you might expect to happen do, but even more things you likely hadn't even considered also do. I watched AEG two days ago, and I'm still trying to process the experience.The Russos, McFeely, and Markus have proven they're in a league of their own behind the camera. They took what they gave us with I.W., and surpassed even that. ""Avengers: Endgame"" redefines full-circle. I'm confident by the end of its run, this will beat ""The Dark Knight"" with its IMDb (total) score.All praise is deserved 3000%.",positive
"Rarely i can say that a film has had considerable influence over me. And even rare is when a film takes control over me. Avengers Endgame is exactly that and more.TBH i didn't know what to expect. The slightest of mistakes and it could tip the balance ( no pun intended) and they handled it as best as they could.Usually i go for a long and delicate review. But this time, everybody pretty much knows what they're gonna get. There is nothing you will miss. Nothing you can brash this film for.It will sure be an experience that you're gonna remember forever.",positive
Russo brothers you really outdid yourselves . THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME . Wish tony stark didnt die though:(,positive
I regret not seeing this in theatres when it came out. This is one of those films that you need to see on the big screen so you can appreciate it truly for the masterpiece it is.,positive
I think it was only right that they had Iron Man make the sacrifice to save the universe. This made him truly the protector of the Earth.,positive
The action scenes were good and had enough twists in the plot to keep it from becoming predictable.,positive
"Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie by any means. What left me disappointed was the lack of clever writing for Thor and Banner. Reducing Dr. Banner (Yes, DOCTOR Banner) into a stumbling baffoon instead of an intelligent scientist was the wrong way to go. Instead the writers decided to turn Banner into hapless victim, first in Ragnarok and then in Infinity War, it seemed that the writers found a way for Ruffalo to get more face screen time out of the character rather than the CGI created Hulk. Thor seemed to have suffered the same fate after.",positive
"I really enjoyed endgame even tgough it's not a perfect film. First i'm gonna talk about the stuff that i liked: an epic final battle with captain america finally saying avengers assemble, steve lifting mjølnir and the score. Now to the stuff that i didn't like. Number 1: fat thor. I mean the russo brothers completely downgraded his character. He got such an awesome character development in ragnarok and infinity war but then they did this. What a disgrace. Number 2: Killing thanos at the beginning of the film. I really liked thanos in infinity war and i was really hyped to see him fight the avengers once more in endgame but then he's killed at the beginning. Wtf? Sure they brought the 2014 version of him for the final battle but if the 2014 version of him was killed by tony at the end then wouldn't infinity war have never happened? This is why time travel just doesn't work for a film like this. Number 3: the action. In my opinion there was not enough action in the film. Sure there was a little in the middle like when captain america fought his past self but the real action didn't start until the last 30 minutes of the film which came as a surprise to me considering this is a 3 hour film. Marvel had more than enough time to do big battles in the middle of the film. Even though this movie had flaws it was still very entertaining.",positive
"Predictable plot.
Predictable outcome.
A few plotholes and convenience plot device here and there.
Awesome last fight though, especially involving Cap. Probably made some goosebumps. (it didn't to me, though)The film tries to invoke emotions from the audience, but when it tries it too much, somehow it soften the blow, even when it involves characters you care about. However, this is definitely the way if wanna close out some chapters of a character. Build them up slowly and then go for the payoff. Not do it in 2 films.Overall, I'd say it's a typical Marvel film. It's definitely a love letter to the fans who have been watching since Ironman 1 came out. But having said that, they probably will never reach the heights of these past few films have achieved. Probably.",positive
"Not bad but it's the weakest avenger movie.
It's just mediocre",negative
First off let me point out something notice how most of the reviews here are basically blocked out so that it only shows 1 star and below. I feel like these r the reviews that r fake.This movie was an excellent ending to a beautiful era of the avengers universe. Every single individual superhero movie was worth watching in prep for this movie. The time travel scenes helped in case newcomers never seen the previous movies. The cgi was excellent and the casting as usual was great. I absolutely loved the surprise ending whe. All chracters gather together to fight thanos himself. This movie is worth seeing for any marvel fan.,positive
"This movie had everyone in the movie theatre cheering, laughing and crying throughout the whole movie. Everything you'd hope Endgame to be, IS just that.",positive
"The film may not have outstanding action scenes as the previous ones but it had a tremendous amount of story and depth which, to me, seems fair taking into consideration the aftermath of Avengers: Infinity War.",positive
"Everything you wanted for a final movie, is packed in this epic movie called endgame.",positive
"Man this movie is just awesome.
Its funny , full of action and emotional hell lot of emotion.
Booked 1st show of the day and can't get it out a my head. Surely Marvel doesn't disappoint ( never).
Its a proper justice to Avengers Franchise.",positive
"A great superhero movie from adventure to action! I never thought it would be this good. Thanos is the best enemy I've ever seen! From the emotional scene to the epic scene, whatever I say is empty! Don't miss out on this movie! Get your ticket now! An epic end!⭐ 100/82",positive
"What a movie!
Only one fight, and best end fight

The MCU breaks the Record of the world's box office!,positive
"I know I get a lot of hate for saying this, but Infinity War was far more superior and far better than Endgame - the play in Infinity War was better, the story in Infinity War was better .... Endgame seems a little too rushed, like everything just had to quit right now.Endgame is certainly a great MCU movie, there is no doubt about it, but I thought there was too much hype about it, to what it actually gives the audience.
The scenes that should be sad and may lead to tears, I thought, were not quite as well done, either by the producer or the actor.
Thor, they have done everything too Stand-Up-like. It all seems like once the inn humor and junk.That Iron Man eventually dies, to save everyone, that's really sad, I must admit... but still seemed to be missing more than he just set out, said goodbye to 3-4 characters and then died .
Captain America to deliver the Infinity stones and then stay in Peggy's time, but still in the present and handing his shield to The Falcon, I seemed strange + certainly not the right replacement as Captain America.",positive
The movie picks storyline at its own convenience. Impossible things become possible at the noise orchestra. My biggest complain is that there is no coherence especially how do you quantity powers of these super heroes ? Just hit smash and do it all over again.,negative
"Picking up after the massive losses of the Infinity war, the scattered Avengers are grieving their losses and figuring out how to go forward. How do you cap off the first wildly successful Avengers franchise? This film is made for the fans. Five of our team went. Some of us are diehard fans and some have only seen an occasional movie. We all felt like it was a truly well done movie that was worth our time and emotional energy. Parents should know that if your child could sit through Infinity War without squirming or being afraid- you should be set for this one! But it is a little over three hours in a theater! It was an amazing decade of movies from Marvel and we've had some great conversations over them.

"Found this film is equally as good as Infinity War in its own rights, and the perfect way to end the beginning of the Marvel Universe.The film will make you laugh, cry, and a lot of it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I cant say much more, but for me its one of the best film I have seen in history, and I feel that it dominates other franchise films with ease.",positive
"I am a MCU fan. Throughout the last ten years, I have watched every film expect for Captain Marvel. However, I don't like the glamor of the new MCU films. When people watch superhero films, they want to feel a connection. While the latest Avengers films was great, it felt gimmicky and was too ""Hollywoodish"" for my tastes. As the budgets keep getting bigger and better, I'm afraid the films will lose their hearts. I'm a simple woman: I like good storytelling and compelling characters. Clumping everybody in the MCU in one film is gimmicky and cheap. And if the truth was to be told, Thanos is the saving grace of Endgame. Keep the heart, Marvel!",positive

"I could have given this movie a score of 100 out of 10, which means that this could be the most astounding movie of all time. But unfortunately it didn't deserve it. As you might find in many other reviews, people are giving high scores and mostly 10. I could've done such thing, but prefer not to. Why?It turns out that you still can see some obvious flaws in the movie. But most people will not notice it because they're just following the hype of conceiving this as the best movie of the year.In Infinity War (previous movie), everybody know that at the end of the post credit scene, Nick Fury summons Captain Marvel to help the Avengers in the fight against Thanos. This make every viewer expect that Captain Marvel will play a significant role in Endgame. But I think due to many criticism for the solo movie ""Captain Marvel"", the director decided to make Captain Marvel has less role in Avengers: Endgame. Hence, after you watch this Avengers: Endgame, you'll start to wonder, why did Nick Fury ask for her help when the Avengers could defeat Thanos without her anyway?The second flaw, is when you'll notice something is just not right. I mean when you're in an ""Armageddon battle"", where millions of units are killing each other, you'll expect to see tons of explosions and tons of moving objects at every part of the battle field. Instead, you'll be disappointed in this part. Whoever is the consultant or the chief of CGI, failed to deliver the most epic ""Endgame battle"" of all time.So as a conclusion, it's just ALMOST perfect.",positive
"It was okay not that bad, but i didn't really get excited the most parts where really boring the only thing i really enjoyed was the final battle.Some things i really don't understand is like where did captain marvel came from? She just came in the last view minutes in the movie to fight thanos🤔 tony's death could have been better if cap saw actually tony die.🙄 i didn't really get emostional when he died wat made me cry was the reaction of his loved ones NOT HIS DEATH i think this movie is overhyped for no reason. And natasha death didn't make sense i didn't get one single tear while she was one of my favorite characters i thought they were going back in time to get her back well they obviously didn't her death was shocking and dumb. If i had to rank the marvel movies it would be this:
1. Winter soldier
2. Infinty war
3. Civil war
4. Age of ultron
5. Avengers endgame.",positive
"Now, don't get all surprised. I did not hate the movie, quite the opposite in fact. I dug the opening scene (or prologue, or whatever), I enjoyed the pacing (at least, for the most part), and the third act was, there I say, on point.PROS:The direction - I must say that almost every scene in this film is shot beautifully.The acting - I honestly cannot recall one poorly acted moment from any of the actors, and that's all I have to say.The opening scene - As mentioned early, I dug it and thought that it was quite thrilling; one minute, you're having a picnic or something with your family, and the next, each and every one of them vanishes into thin air.Each and every scene with Nebula - From the scene between her and Tony Start, to her trying to reason with Gamora, Thanos, and herself, literally.Scott Lang (aka Antman) - Now, let's be honest, the actual plot of the movie would not have begun if it weren't for him. I mean, I'm not saying that he was a plot device (unlike somebody in the movie), he did have a character arc; which is more than I can say for his role in Civil War. Anyway, as soon as Antman appeared onscreen, I kept wondering, 'How long was he in that machine? Why was he in it to begin with? Did I miss something?' (I've not seen Antman and the Wasp, for those of you who don't know) But surely enough, one of those questions was eventually answered. But the point is, I liked how the character was as (if not, more than) confused as I was. I mean, he pretty much stumbled upon the aftermath of an apocalypse.The climax - All I can really say is 'Holy crap!' It had almost every MCU character that I wanted to see come back. And, for the most part, it did: Spider-Man, Scarlett Witch, Starlord, Black Panther, the list goes on. And when Captain America finally yelled ""Avengers assemble!"", I was like 'hell yes!'; though, I do wish that there'd been in the theater I was sitting in, because it was mostly just silence.And last, but certainly not least, Tony Stark's funeral - First off, I did not expect the movie to go that direction; I mean, him dying just moments after snapping Thanos and his army into dust, it had me quite surprised. And the way his funeral was handled left me severely touched. After all, he had a daughter in the movie, and the very last line she had left theater I was in chuckling; yeah, it was obviously a nod to the first Iron Man movie.CONS:The writing - I have no idea what the hell happened. Yes, the main plot of the film involves time-travel, which I honestly was expecting before going into this. And I will agree that the movie itself is now flooded with plot-holes, but I can only count two of them. The first one being with Nebula and her past self. I don't recall why, she ends ends up shooting her past self, and I'm positive that it actually kills past self. But, for whatever reason, future Nebula still remains; suspension of disbelief I guess.Captain Marvel - a lot of people complained that she was barely in the movie, while others flat-out praised that fact. I, on the other hand, was pretty underwhelmed by her lack of screen-time. Maybe it was because Larson was busy filming her solo movie at the time, which is an unknown fact by the way. So yeah, she was nothing more than a plot-device; another gripe I had was that her was cut shorter, the more the movie when on, but that's just me.Black Widow's sacrifice - To start off, when the team are traveling back in time, Natasha and Hawkeye go over to a familiar place. It is of course the same place Thanos and Gamora went to in the previous film, where he ... you know. Now, I'm not entirely sure how the whole thing went down (I mean, I had to use the restroom at least three times during the movie), but what I remember is Black Widow and Hawkeye end up fighting (for the second time in this franchise), and it ends with them hanging onto a cliff, moments before Natasha decides to let go and falls right to her (supposed) death. So yeah, as soon as the team make it back, Hawkeye informs them that Natasha did not make it, but they react by sadly saying 'Oh well.' Yeah, that's obviously not what either of them said, but that's the best description I have for that scene. I mean, not only do they brush it off likes it's nothing later on, the whole movie does that as well, they all mourn her death for just a few seconds; that being said, Tony Start died in a much better fashion than she did.Thor and Hulk - Oh, dear god. For those of you who don't know, I don't like Thor Ragnarok, I thought it was needlessly comical at best, I didn't like that the supporting characters in the previous Thor films were killed off, and I thought that the new ones introduced were mostly annoying. That being said, I thought the makers of this franchise have already gotten their heads out of their asses, and redeemed Thor as the badass we all know and love, like he was in the previous film. Sadly though, we did not, as they makers of this screwed his character up big time. They gave him his long blond hair back, which I actually appreciated, but they also gave him a pot-belly; yes, a pot belly. The worst part for me was that they even brought back Valkyire and Korg. Many people have also complained the portrayal of Hulk in this, but I honestly could care less; I've never liked Mark Ruffalo in the role to begin with. So yeah, Thor was just comic relief for the majority of the film.Another huge gripe I had was not having Sif in the movie - I mean, come on, she was one of the best parts of the first two Thor movies. And now, what the hell? Since Thor: The Dark World, she's just gone, without a single trace. But that's okay, she was replaced with Valkyrie; I'm sorry, I really don't like that character.Yet another gripe that I had was the the movie didn't include that one song by 30 Seconds to Mars called ""This is war"". I'm just saying that it was a huge missed opportunity.And last but certainly not least, the ending - Now, I've read comments from people across the internet saying that they actually like (if not, love) the film's ending. I on the other hand cannot see how; and yes, it is the second (if not, biggest plot-hole) that I can count. The last scene of the film is Hulk sending Captain America back in time again. And I assumed that it was to save Black Widow, but no. Apparently it was so he could reunite with Peggy Carter, his love interest from the first Captain America movie. I mean, the scene shows him as an elder sitting alone at a bench, and then giving his shield to Falcon; not Bucky, Falcon. And the very last shot is him and Peggy slowly dancing together. Where do I begin? There was a scene of him staring at Peggy through a glass window, but, honestly, that could've been cut from the film entirely. Or they could have kept that scene, and instead have him give the shield her as a memory of him; yeah, doesn't make a lick of sense, but it certainly makes more sense than what the writers went with. Also, the fact that Steve reunited with her in whatever year he went back to, he would not have ever become an avenger. I mean, did he really keep the shield for that long? And the fact that he stayed in that time period, how did they avengers win the battle, or the passed battles that they fought in? Do you expect us to believe that the alternate timelines still exist and Captain America in said time periods is still present in them? Lastly, why reunite with Peggy? Steve was much closer to Natasha than he's ever been with anyone; seriously, the more you think about all of it, the less sense it starts to make.Another thing that I've been hearing was that Brie Larson/Captain Marvel has been getting blamed for some (if not, most) of this movie's flaws, which is quite unfair if you ask me. And I'd hate to say this, because I know that it's going to piss a lot of MCU fans off, but Captain Marvel (which I actually liked) had much better payoff than this film did.",positive
"Seriously, as a Hulk fan, I walked away so disappointed. They started humiliating Hulk with Ragnarok, then Infiniti war, where we thought they are keeping him for a climax. Next thing you know, Mr. Hulk crying and wiping his tears! Reminded me with DC killing their flagship Charecter Superman. I just gave it 6 respecting the effort of making the film though.",positive
"The action sequences are always the same, the plots are always the same, every Marvel movie in this cinematic universe was exactly the same. All 22 of them were the same movie.There is no creativity, just massive budgets, a star studded cast, as much cgi as possible, boring dialogue, poor character development, no deeper meaning whatsoever, poor cinematography, eye popping special effects, and watered down violence that is on par with the old power rangers.These movies can't even hold a flame to the Dark Night trilogy which deal with the human condition, psychology, are immensely quotable, have real violence, and are more than guys in tights dancing around triumphantly saying the corniest lines ever spoken in the history of cinema.George Lucas made Star Wars to sell toys, and these Marvel movies are no different. Why do you think Disney bought the rights to both?",negative

"8/10To properly understand the motives of the characters in this film, start by viewing the first output of Marvel Studios. Over 21 films make up the backlog of this saga. That's how big Avengers: Endgame is.Avengers: Endgame closes the saga in emphatic fashion, juggling multiple story arcs without feeling overstuffed. Each character is given a story that is organic and flows directly from previous events. With a villain whose characterization is better than the last, the heroes race to return and save the world they once knew. No action scene is there for the mere spectacle, instead they serve a greater purpose that builds up for the final showdown. Speaking of action, as the farewell of the saga, it delivers in spades that is sure to make the general audience and fans alike stand on their seats. Endgame is simply a tribute to the fans of the franchise, giving them its best moments in action and drama.",positive
"I came back from watching ENDGAME last night, and I could not help thinking they could have done more with the movie...it was ok but not as good as I expected it to be, I really wanted to see more in the final battle scene but it was all over the place. Also, the beginning was abit dragged out...but overall it was ok, enough for an 8/10.",positive
"I liked infinity war, but endgame really fell short for me. I really feel like its getting great reviews because its not cool to do otherwise.The whole time travel thing with multiple ""heists"" ended up being confusing.Having Thanos die right at the start, and the infinity stones already destroyed, and then Iron Man figure out how to travel through time was pretty dumb.If they would have explored Thanos' character a bit more, like why does 'killing half the universe' make any friggin' sense. Thanos seems to have some sort of moral code, it would have been interesting to explore that and come up with some depth to his character.Perhaps they could have worked from there, and come up with a more creative story.There would have been so many possibilities - maybe play off the relationship with Thanos and Nebula. maybe use of the stones to actually 'reverse' time - have only one time line - instead of the lame and overused idea of magically going back in time and then changing the future. It never really makes sense.They could have introduced something to force Thanos to actually reverse the timeline, or have one of the avengers get one of the stones, like the time stone.All that said, there were some really cool moments in the movie, and a ridiculous amount of effort went into this film.",positive
"After 22 films spanning 11 years, the culmination of the mcu is finally here. This movie really tied together the entire mcu, and this movie really is a gift to every fan who has been so invested in these movies and characters.",positive
"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has given us a lot of great characters and pulling of a final movie that uses all their unique abilities equally was always going to be a near impossible task. Endgame is proof of that. It didn't feel like the Avengers became a real team or learned much during these 22 movies. Their plans and tactics felt amateurish. I was hoping for something deeper and cleverer, but that never materialized. It was entertaining, well produced and acted, but for me it never got near masterpiece territory.",positive

"After the poignant ending of EndGame, the baton has passed on the next phase of the MCU franchise. I just hope Marvel Studios can just match what they have given us here.The character driven moments in EndGame is what set it apart from the other Avengers movies to-date. Just go and watch it not for the spectacle that we expect but for the many characters many of us have grown accustomed to.",positive
I'm no reviewer of films but just my two cents! That was amazing! It was the perfect way to end a 22 film cycle that will never be done again and that is why it gets a 10 from me.,positive
Just go see it if you're a fan of the other films.,positive
Outstanding final installment! Sad to see it end but the ending couldn't have been better. I would see this again!,positive
I don't have a lot to say but this was amazing work. The combination of all the great Marvel movies in the past 11 years to get this. Also so many references and jokes that were really funny especially if you know the movies well.,positive
"This movie was so overhyped so it hurt the review but it's a better then average movie. The beginning is slow which is fine cause it usually creates tenseness; however, the movies pacing jumps along to going fast and then back to slow. It's pacing is bad and vary irritating. There were many unexplained plot holes too. Usually this is fine but the audience needs details especially in a lore as deep as marvels. There was too much emotion and it didn't have to end the way it did. Still is a must see and a good film, just not the conclusion we needed.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent masterpiece what was worth the wait, if you ask me. A terrific sequel to Infinty War, but i liked this one more.
The best Avengers movie Marvel has brought us.",positive
Chop this movie in half and it would be a solid 8. This version of the Avengers is painfully long; it would be a thriller like the last installment if it was way shorter.,positive
"This is the culmination of everything just plain bad. I'm used to these superhero movies going over the top and disregarding the laws of psychics, nature indeed the universe to be somewhat entertained however this movie sinks to a new low. Iron man now has a new suit that magically forms from nothing at the press of a button, the hulk has been reduced a comical shadow of his former self and thor is now some emotional drunkard with a beergut. I could forgive all that if the story made some sense and was at least remotly possible but seriously time travel!! That has to be the worst laziest unimaginative peice of writing possible. ""Question: why not just go back and kill thanos when he was an infant? Answer: it doesnt work like that."" Really that's your explanation!!! I'm sorry but that is just one of the many many holes in this movie not to mention past Nebular travelling to the future and ends up getting killed by future Nebular. How can she be alive to kill her past self???????? IT CANT HAPPEN!!!!! so in summary this whole movie is totally ridiculous, impossible and an insult to any half way intelligent human being. I know it's just a movie, however these paradoxes are just to big to ignore to get any enjoyment from this debacle.",negative
"Endgame is a resounding and epic end to a 10 year journey of Marvel movies. Even though it introduces tons of plot holes and questions that need answering, its character moments are definitely satisfying.",positive
"Infinity War left the MCU in a devastated stated and Endgame picks right up where it left off. The story of Endgame is a patient one like the MCU has been throughout the last 11 years and slowly windes you through the rabbit hole. The emotions you go through are from funny to sad and out right stressful. Great story overall and some of the best batch of acting in the entire MCU and by all parties involved. Wonderfully directed by the Russo Brothers. I as a fan can't thank them enough and especially to Kevin Feige for making the MCU what it is which in my opinion one of the best executions of a film franchise ever. This was a clear cut plan to give us the fans a slow and intimate story that began Iron Man and still continues. Thank you Stan Lee. You were the best and will be very missed. We love you and I tip my cap to everyone involved in the MCU.The acting in this movie is very VERY under rated. This is by far the best performance by the original 6, nevermind the others involved. I feel the Robert and Chris Evans gave us some of the best acting we will see in comic book movie. Thank you to the whole cast. Just awesomeWith all this being said I'm going to go see it again.",positive
"This movie is incredible. When i wasnt in shock, i had the grin the whole time. It really reward the fans who followed the MCU since IronMan 1. I laughed, I cried, and it trully was tour de force. I dont thing i will see anything like that in my lifetime. Bravo",positive
"Of all the movies I think about being the most most memorable, I think of It (2017) and Endgame, but probably Endgame because I actually went to theaters for Endgame. I'll talk about It in another review.
Endgame is the most memorable because it was literally the only thing all my peers at school would talk about for like a half a year. It was probably longer for 6th graders because they were even more crazy about it from what I heard. It also is the most memorable because it was so long and it is the epic conclusion of like 22 marvel movies.
Oh yeah, you also can't forget this movie because of Thanos epic quote ""I am inevitable""
I want to actually write a review about this but this movie is just too complicated to talk about in one review it would take forever (not saying this movie is confusing. It made perfect sense) So let me just say this is the best Marvel movie so far, but not the best movie ever made. I wish it would just be the end because it would be the best time to end it because it was so epic, but you know Disney want that money so we got to make more.",positive
"The movie is as grand and rich (if seen on big screen) as the last part (Infinity war) however some of the key points were missed and the story linkage is a bit missed out. Some of the questions were unanswered and the ending had some lag...... Keeping this aside, the experience is fun filled with all our favourite superheroes unite against Thanos (although his viewpoint was also logical, not justifying the act on it). The scene where everyone fight Thanos and Captain America did something amazing (fans expected that) is mind-boggling. That scene in itself deserves 10 star...!! Stream it for sure.",positive
"So here we have it, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, the expansive sequel to not only AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR but also to the whole last 13 years or so of Marvel cinema. It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.",positive
"Like most of the MCU, this film hits its highs. Snappy dialogue, likable characters, has some heart, laughs aplenty, huge cast, pop-culture references galore. You go see it and you enjoy yourself. But by the time you make it from your theater seat to your car, it's already started wearing off. This is much of my gripe with MCU films as a whole and much of my gripe with Endgame.I enjoyed the film. Like I said, fun. In the way that eating cotton candy is fun but leads to stomach pain minutes after you're done. Endgame suffers from too much fan-service at best and at worst is flat-out dumb and doesn't make sense.The Highs:
There's real heart here. The scenes with fathers and daughters got me in the feels. The Hawkeye opening with his family was really well-done. The Tony Stark daughter stuff was nice. I appreciated the opening third for giving in to the dark ending of the last film. I loved Fat Thor. And I thought the ending, though expected, was well executed.The Lows:
The middle chapter is a mess. I mean, a real mess. The time-traveling plot is so nonsensical that at one point they literally start rattling off other time-travel movies that don't make sense to excuse themselves. One of the lovable things about the MCU is it doesn't take itself too seriously, but this feels like a bridge too far. It literally doesn't make sense that they can change somethings and not others, and it's convoluted and it involves battery packs.The CGI overload gets tiresome. There are entire scenes where no one real is even on screen. You have giant purple Josh Brolin with a scrotum chin talking to blue lady with a mix of 6'8"" Voldemort at Power Forward. I like some of this, but over-reliance on it feels too artificial and video-game like.The film tries to fit way too much in, such as the dark Hawkeye plotline that is referred to but mostly happens offscreen until one 2-minute fight. We didn't need to see that.While the device of literally traveling back through previous movies has a nostalgic touch, is that the best way to really wrap up the story? Or should we blaze a new trail here?Overall, the whole snap felt contrived, knowing that all the characters would come back and that the only one who would die were Cap and Iron Man, largely because the actors' contracts are up. We talked at the office about this going in and said Iron Man would die and Cap would likely go back to the '40s. So where's the surprising storytelling here?This is fun, entertaining popcorn fare, but it has zero depth and nothing truly fresh to offer.If you're reading this in the 2020s you probably agree this film doesn't hold up at all.Or you've gotten your hands on one of those magic Duracells.",positive
"There was a lot to tie up with this film and there were lots of fan service-y bits. No surprise they managed to defeat Thanos and get back al, the characters killed off in the snap, and no surprise there were a few deaths - but slightly surprised by poor Natasha's demise. Personally, I'd have preferred the terminally dull Hawkeye went off that cliff!It was sort of obvious Brie Larson films this before her solo Captain Marvel film as she hadn't quite got the character sorted - plus to be honest, has very little to do - apart from a butch haircut!
A whole stack of underused female characters reappeared - Jane! Peggy! Tilda! Thor's mum! But really this was one for the boys with the core cast of the original movies getting the most screen time - chiefly Thor, Cap and Tony who are the heart of the early MCU but lots of Hulk too.I found it pretty satisfying on the whole but that ending scene at the lake has absolutely appalling cgi - I didn't believe many of those actors were really there. Cumberbatch in particular looked very odd. In a movie this big, it stood out like a sore thumb for me.",positive
"Ohh God... can't trust to my eyes! MCU directors are fricking genius!!! They gave fans what they want with their option of ending. Real MCU fans'll realize how hard they tried to make a masterpiece!! You'll understand the true power, emotions, feelings of the characters... Be prepared for what you're not expecting! Thank you guys for the greatest job...😊👍🏼",positive
"Infinity War is a Masterpiece and there is no comparison between IW and Endgame more like EndLame.This movie is full of plotholes , poorly written dramatic scenes and lame attempts at humor.Why does Ironman has to die , why he had to wear the gauntlet to snap Thanos when they were going to beat Thanos anyway. Fat thor, useless Hulk, ant-man , captain marvel, hawkeye, captain America , black panther, doctor strange, spiderman , Ironman etc all were there. There was no need of that end snap. I know they wanted to give Iron man a farewell but in a satisfying way, in movie it felt like it was totally useless. And what about Hulk and thanos encounter , oh yeah there wasn't one. I was waiting for proffessor Hulk to step up to Thanos , another disappointment.Many people liked the last interaction between Hawkeye and Black widow but personally found it cringy and over dramatic with lame writing.In IW you can clearly see every character was given their share of screen time and justified roles but Endgame was mess .I have watched IW in theatres 4 times plus many times at home and i would still watch it and enjoy but Endgame i can't.Many stupid fanboys and casual watchers might find this movie good but the people who likes things making sense and a story which takes you deep into it would feel how unsatisfying this movie is .Even casting Brie Larson as captian marvel wasn't that bad as this movie .Last words : Infinity War wasn't the movie we deserved but It was the movie we needed.And this movie (Endgame) is not even close to what it should be.",negative
"You have seen a zillion movies and think you know everything a film maker can do .And then you watch this and all that ego shatters to dust.

I've watched it multiple times and I love it more every time!,positive
This movie was absolutely perfect. There is nothing more I wanted in this film and it gave me all kinds of emotions that I've never felt in a movie Before! it had the most satisfying ending and it really did conclude the Avengers. The final battle is way more that I could've ever wanted and they also made Hawkeye so badass and I loved him in this film 😂,positive
I just want to say how amazing this film is from start to finish. This will take you on a emotional ride.You will not he disappointed,positive
"I am a big marvel fan. When I saw infinity war's ending I was immediately excited for this movie. This was easily my most anticIpated movie of the year and probable of all time. When tickets went on sale I got some for the midnight premiere immdiately. And somehow dispite my high expections this movie destroyed them and created a even better movie then I could have imagined.I loved every second of this movie. Even the first act were most people have complaints I loved. The second act is better then the first but man that final act is just masterpiece. Every cast member from beginning to end is amazing with Robert Downey Jr and Chris Even's being standouts. And thats not easy since I think everyone gave their best performance here and are all able to draw emotions from you. Now some directions charectors take will be not suite everyone. In fact how the avengers deal with the events of infinity war isn't gonna go well for everyone. But I for one loved it. Lead to a few cheer moments. But if you wanna talk about cheer moments man that final act. No spoilers but I wanted cheer at many moments. Two moments I nearly jumped out of my set. But while it's mostly laughs and smiles when this movies wants you to feel man it'll make you feel. If you've been a long time fan (you've probable already seen it but anyway) you will choke up I know I did and I feel no shame admitting it.If you want max enjoyment out of this film. Watch the rest of the movies. I know it sounds demanding but it's worth it. Cause you'll understand meaning behind stuff. I saw it with my dad and the two moments I nearly jumped out of my seat over he was thinking ""Ah ok"" so yes do watch the other movies if you haven't before you see this one.In the end Avengers: Endgame is in my opinion is one of my favourite movies of all time and the best marvel movie to date and I dought that will change. I know I didn't say much about the movie but I'm trying to be spoiler-free and the trailers show like nothing of the movie and thats what I based my can I talk about this ot not kinda mind set. But I can't describe how satisfied I was. This truely was an end of an era and I all I can say is I am so glad to be apart of it. To follow these charectors and become connected to them and then to finally see the conculsion thia masterpiece of a story was more then worth the wait.",positive
"If you're a marvel fan that has been waiting for this since day 1 this is your film the Russo's single handily gave us everything we wanted to see. Throughout the movie I was giddy with excitement over references from iron man 1 and 3, captain america winter soldier, ant man and the wasp, absolutely every film made by Marvel truly tying in the whole MCU in a wonderful finale giving you exactly what you want. You'll love it x3000 I guarantee you that.",positive
"I like how the writers can easily make someone build a time machine faster than making himself his own suit 🤣 i mean, seriously its a time machine man, anthe build up to it just so bad, needs more build up on how time machines can be build, not just 1 guy appeared tells a phenomenon then voila, time machine is ready in 1 night.Also, how the conflict happened is probably more stupid than anything in the world. I mean, she can just try to go back to present time AGAIN when she knew that he was there instead of letting herself captured.And rdj acting in the final scene was actually meh and cringe. There's no emotion in that scene, not at all. Could happened because there's no good build up for him to die.Thumbs up for chris evan, he nailed every scene he's in.Also the aftermath is a bit unclear, too many plot holes, too many fantasy with no explanation at all. Overall a stupid movie, but the fight scene paid it all. Especially the original trio vs thanos and damn can't imagine how badass thanos with his double-edged sword.",positive
Yeah it's awesome. 23 movies and a decade worth of film making culminated in this. The like of which we may never see again.,positive
"Like many I would like to say, don't believe the hype, if your like me and have grown up with the world of marvel then it would be a crime not to watch it having endured probably the best marvel film ever: infinity war.Having watched endgame I left the cinema rather disappointed but couldn't work out why, at first I didn't want to admit it but after watching it for a second time I realised... it just wasn't simply as entertaining as infinity war ! But then what a hard movie to follow, it reminds me of your fav band , they'll have a standout album but will never be able to repeat that success , so infinity war was the peak for the avengers series by far.Always gonna be hard to top that, and be interesting to see where the marvel movies go from here .. endgame sure it's entertaining for some parts, boring for others and a bit of an anti climax ending but nether the less is still a must watch for all marvel fans",positive
"The writers went to far with this one.Somethings wrong with today's society,for ppl to even consider this garbage as one of the greatest films ever made with an of 8.5 is a disgrace.8.5?????seriously,this film is an abomination to marvel fans and the entire human race,there was no love and passion done with this it was only for money.I hate this film and I especially hate the writers who did this,this couldve been the greatest of the greats.",negative
"What a film! Avengers: Endgame did not disappoint. The Russo brothers have managed to perfectly balance drama, character, humour, breathtaking action and big stakes amongst a cast bigger than a high school yearbook!
Though there a couple of questions and potential plot holes that remain once the credits roll, you almost don't mind as the journey was worth it.
For any comic book fan this was exactly what marvel comics do translated to the big screen. You get the grand battle featuring the entire ensemble all at once, with everything on the line. Exactly translated as you'd see in the pages of Marvel comics.
A perfect ending to an amazing saga.",positive
"Just want to thanks Stan lee Jack Kirby and Jim Starlin for creating these characters
and thanks to Russo brothers for bringing them on to screen in the best way",positive
"I feel like this movie really closed the franchise nicely. It's always hard to end an era, but this was a brilliant culmination of the buildup created throughout 20+ movies. Solidly concluded.",positive
"The movie became a epic conclusion to the mcu two people die in the film that is black widow and freakin iron man, everybody returns at the end this is a epic film",positive
Loved every minute of it and I'm going to view it again! Favourite movie of all! Can't wait for more!,positive
"This movie is only really good if you've seen all or most of the movies that led up to it (i.e. From Iron Man, Captain America, the first Avengers Movie, up to Infinity War), but is still a good one if you've seen less or not much of the previous ones.Part of the story is the buildup, which leads to the anticipation of the conclusion. The MCU has tried its best to do just that, and it was done in grand fashion. The twists that comes with this film is executed very well, tying it up with the events of the previous avengers, and a quest to avenge those who have fallen brought forth an epic search, battle, and a sad and heartwarming, yet victorious, conclusion.Animations are of course excellent, as well as the actors for the cast of Avengers. They've put their heart in a franchise that led to a blossoming friendship off and on the screen, which made the cohesiveness and chemistry of this cast really stand out in the film.There's no reason not to see one of the biggest films of the decade. Iif you truly want to enjoy it at its fullest, watch the films in the MCU that led up to the Endgame.",positive
"To begin with, it was a good film, decent acting, great effects, a lot of funny parts where whole cinema laughts, but to get a 9/10 or even higher rating movie must have much much better than that, so probably only comics fan boys can rate it higher. The truth is that movie was too long, last hour or at least half hour of the movie was a waste of time, its sci fi, not documentary movie, we dont need to see how they live happy ever after, also despite good fulfillment, you have to say that scenario is what, time machine scenario is the easiest one to extract more money, but the movie leaves the feeling that it is not the true ending.
Also the biggest lie is that someone wants to watch it second or third time, even when watching the first one, last hour you question yourself when it will finnish.",positive
"For Avengers, is good Conclusion, a lot twit story, and time traveler things, hmm seem good concept, but just one thing i really notice, is, Captain Marvel is useless, not really perfect. Just my opinion",positive
"Had huge expectations from End Game after the ending of Infinity War and it just fell flat after initial 40 min's.Movie feels boring at lot of places and the ending....lets not talk about it... could have been more sensational. There are few moments having humour...but those moments are very shortlived.
What worst...made martyr of character whose movies were the best of all Marvel Universe.",positive
"This is a super hero's film nothing close to reality but still annoying to a point.Forced feminism scene is irritating. Its so forced that for a few seconds in the scene all men are cut out. It's ridiculous.Also the ending is sad. Most ppl would say its sad but satisfying, i on the other hand I disagree. There are better endings that would be more suitable and satisfying.Movie is too long.The death of tony stark and the retiring of captain America.",negative
"I just have to said, thank you, to Kevin feige, to Marvel studios, to Anthony and Joe Russo, to Disney, to Robert Downey JR, to all the cast, you make this posible.",positive
"You could be the type of person that completely tears apart this movie, and point out its inconsistencies plot holes. Of course their are these things, and that is my problem with the movie. But I look past that, and I am the type of person who enjoys the entire 3 hours and 2 minutes of this movie.",positive
"I'm not going to spoil anything. Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but those 2 first hours... So many plot holes. If you're someone with a minimum of logic and appreciate intelligent writing, chances are you'll get mad a couple times in the first 2 acts. However, that last hour was THE best segment I have ever scene in a superhero movie. It was really epic and everything you probably hoped for. It really saved the movie and boosted my rating. The rest of the movie would've been a 6-7 in my opinion. It's definitely not the best MCU movie like some hardcore fans are pretending it to be, but you still have to see the movie. The conclusion is very satisfying! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer. I even had goosebumbs at one point, and I'm not even a HUGE fan of the MCU. It's a must see. Enjoy!",positive
"Avengers: Endgame actually manages to keep audiences pumped and delivered the thrills and action as expected. Here we see our favorite heroes coping with their losses during Infinity War, and how their ragtag team assemble for one final chance to get things right. Of course there are risks, and Thanos, being a true menace, we are always on edge to see how events will play out in the end.
There probably is no individual character arc, but we do see a collective arc in the evolution of the Avengers as a team. We also get to see our favorite heroes back in action, and Thanos as Thanos being Thanos (trying not to spoil anything here). In fact, I thought 3 hours runtime would be agonizing but it felt like any 90 minute movie. The first act seemed a bit slow, but the second act gets our pulses thumping because we saw what had happened to half our heroes the last time, and the third act is an epic battle worthy of all the wait. There is a balance between drama, action, and comedy. However, for me the action scenes are brilliant and the Russo brother manages to show the capabilities of our heroes in full. As part of a massive narrative, it works perfectly. But as a stand alone movie, you will not get the full experience. That said, I wonder what's next for the Avengers.",positive
"Im not the usual type of people that review movie after watched it.But i cant hold it for this one. The visuals are great, the sounds are perfectly fit, the story, the battle, the character. Basically almost everything are perfect for this one!!Great job Marvel, thank you.
I really enjoy the endgame.",positive
Endgame is the ultimatest MCU Movie i've ever seen. Love it. Awesome.,positive
"I honestly have no idea what all the hype was about. The movie was so predictable and this is coming from a guy who loves Marvel and was excited for it myself.
I predicted Black Widow's death and Iron Man's death straight away before they even died.
To me the best Marvel was Spider Man into the Spider-verse.
This movie DOES NOT reach my likings and I am a movie expert!
Thank You.",positive
It's really the movie which was promised. An epic and heartbreaking conclusion to the 22 movies saga. Endgame really worth it ! You must not miss this one. Hats off to the directors Russo Brothers . Storytelling was on the whole new level. Here's my tip to you all before watching this make sure you are ready to see the End 💔,positive
"First of it will remove your stress if you are thinking about what will be the next or what will thanos do. That's it. Beside that, this movie is almost like crap. Sometimes they want to be serious, sometimes funny, sometimes emotional. What a mess. They had created a hype by Infinity War and now break all the records. I think all credit goes to Infinity war. They should have to take time to write a good screenplay. I guess they don't take time because the hype will be damaged. And now give the people a crap.",positive
"This is so not ok! It is extremely bad! On so many different levels, this is awful!",negative
"Wow. That was 3 hours? It flew. Great storytelling, great acting, great action. Nothing more to say.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame, is the final movie in the so called 'infinity' saga, and it lived up to it's hype. More than 20 movies had lead up to this movie, building up the story. 'Infinity war' than came out, the movie that started the epic finale of the era. It ended with a big twist, with the snap that not everybody saw coming. 'Endgame' pics up just after the snap. Even with the more depressing tone that hangs, it still was able to make me laugh. This is a quality that Marvel films keep nailing, they can integrate moments to laugh without making it feel forced. The movie itself was the last of an era, and it gave justice to it. The time travel element made it possible to move trough passed movies and gave so the possibility to integrate old characters. Also the end of the movie had an epic battle that was perfect to end the era, almost all characters fought alongside each other, it gave me goosebumps while watching. The only little critic that I'll give, is Thanos. In infinity war I felt connected with him, but i didn't felt like that during 'Endgame'. I understand that the Thanos we see in 'Endgame' is a different version than the one from 'Infinity war'. But still would I have loved it, if they had given Thanos a bit more attention in 'Endgame', just like in 'infinity war'. Besides this, was the movie perfect in my opinion: great atmosphere building, good pacing, laughable moments that didn't feel forced, returning to past movies,... this movie had all of it, just awesome.",positive

"I was in tears when it was all over, so many years and so much energy put into this saga and I just loved it all.",positive
"I'm honestly surprised at the amount of highly rated reviews, this feels like the standard superhero movie with a few little twists. The characters are standard and fine, with the exception of Captain Marvel, who is so perfect that she only fails when the plot tells her to and she has no stake or motivation in the story. The plot is slow, obvious, and kind-of bad honestly, but the action is good, especially the final action scene.
It's a fine movie, I like it more than Avengers 2, Thor 1-2, etc.
But it's not life changing in any way.
Bonus points to Hawkeye for actually being a somewhat good character.
6.5/10",positive
"Endgame ends the entire MCU, 22 movies and nearly spanning 11 years. The directors had a very clear vision in their mind on how to conclude this avengers and bring on the next set of Avengers. Its one of the best and unexpected way. The movie answers all our questions which snapped in Infinity War. More than you expected. Bt one thing, every MCU fan will come out of the cinema with satisfaction and disappointment (cuz Infinity Saga ends). Kudos to all the cast and crew, their hardwork really paid off. The endgame is one thrilling ride of disappointment which in the end , even if you're disappointed you'll be happy. Enjoy it by yourself rather than hearing from others.",positive
"1) The time stone was glowing when DS passed it to Thanos in IW. This was not addressed in EG and a huge missed opportunity. Could have been a cool time trap, or important save point in time.
2) DS saw 14,000,605 outcomes. Why not give us 2 or 3 really important glimpses into what he saw as a flashback in EG? Missed opportunity.
3) Captain Marvel was a throw in. Should have been tasked with something much cooler to do.
4) I thought you had to sacrifice another whom you loved for the soul stone? Killing yourself doesn't fit into the previous rules.Positive side though they did a wonderful job tugging at your heartstrings in a nice way.
Also I usually avoid 3D and Imax. But the 3D stuff looked really cool.",positive
Don't believe the reviews. I suspect it's people paid to do positive reviews. Either that or I saw a different movie! Nothing much happens for 2 hours. There was no plot to speak of and i could have written better dialogue! The soundtrack is the best thing about it seriously,negative
"""Avengers: Endgame"" indescribable! It has some of the best visual effects I have ever seen in a motion picture! It is very respectful to it's characters and has a great story, but most of all, it ends the story perfectly! This is cinema gold! I cried and laughed and got all of the emotions! What more would you want from a film? Go see it!",positive
"Most electrifying scenes of all time, most emotional scenes of all time, greatest action, hardest goodbyes, comedy, tear rolling big six credits... and so much more. I just wish the writers gave Iron man and Thor their own great moments to shine during the fight with thanos.",positive
"Exhilarating, breathtaking culmination to the Infinity Saga delivers in every way.",positive
"The most complete hero movie I ever seen. Full of emotions and loves. Make hero seem vulnerable and as human as us. And yet make the sacrifice as the last resort
Good job marvel , the thing is we will be expecting a higher ceiling next time and I think it's difficult to raise. A really emotional journey for me has ended.",positive
"Watched Endgame for the 2nd time, and decided to make IMDB account for giving this review as it only gets 8.4/10.I've read under 5 stars reviews, and I recommend if you haven't even watched the trilogies (Iron Man, Thor, CA), just stay the way outta here. Of course if you watch EG without previous movies, you'll find this movie confusing, boring(too long), too many characters, etc. And yes, if you compare to Avengers, AoU, IW, you'll find this movie worse than others because it doesn't have action scene as much as the others. In fact, half of the movie itself only explaining about time travel.But, Endgame is perfect to end Infinity Saga. We got thrilled enough in IW, but they slipped more jokes here, giving us fan service, that epic battle (and all of the characters got the part), and that ending scene give us enough explanation about the Avengers' fate.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame really is the perfect conclusion to the magnificent MCU! Seeing this in the cinema was something else to experience the atmosphere around me. The final battle was done to perfection and the bittersweetness throughout the film gives it a feeling of being real and not just a bunch of superheroes flying around invincibly. If you have followed the rest of the MCU, then this will wrap it all up perfectly. As a stand alone film, it is a fantastic watch!",positive
"While it took a ""human like"" turn where even characters became like us, it felt like it was a rush to the end and you felt at a loss because Thanos still won",positive
"I went to see Avengers: Endgame three times: twice as a fan, once as a critic, and I can say that it did not disappoint. It was a wonderful blend of homage to the previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and tying up the loose ends for all of the characters we've come to love. Of course, the movie was not perfect but was overall an enjoyable Marvel movie that is definitely rewatchable.The plot of Avengers: Endgame picks up right where Infinity War left off. All of the remaining heroes are scattered around and trying to find a way to reverse the terrible effects of the Snap. The movie throws viewers right into the action, with Tony and Nebula returning to earth and reuniting with the others within the first ten minutes, and the death of Thanos occurs right after. After the initial shock wears off, viewers are taken ahead five years, where we learn the whereabouts of our heroes. Tony has raised a family with Pepper, Hawkeye has become Ronin, Thor has become deeply depressed, and the rest are still searching for a way to reverse the Snap. This is where the wrench comes in; Ant-Man returns and suggests time-travel as a way to fix everything. They enlist Hulk (who is now a combination of Banner and Hulk rather than being two separate people), to help them. There were a few problems with this: introducing a new concept that changes everything from the past 21 movies is never a good idea for a film like Endgame, as it opens up too many possibilities, and this film was meant to be a closer to everything the MCU has become over the past 11 years. I had heard many theories on this, but I never expected the MCU to go in that direction. It felt like a deus-ex-machina and was kind of rushed in the explanation. Additionally, the inclusion of Fortnite with Thor and Hulk dabbing felt like cheap jokes to appease the middle school audience, and paints a grim picture of what society might look like by the year 2023.The heroes split up on various quests to retrieve the stone, three of which pay tribute to past MCU films. Iron Man, Captain America, and Ant-Man head to New York to get the Mind and Space stones, while the Hulk goes to the Ancient One to retrieve the Time stone. Of course, this leads them to a sequence from 2012's The Avengers, which is my personal favorite among the MCU movies. We also got a hilarious Cap vs Cap fight scene. This was a great moment of fan-service, as we got to see where the team began. Ant-Man and Iron Man fail to get the Tesseract, and Loki gets ahold of it, disappearing into who-knows-where. Hawkeye and Black Widow head to find the Soul stone, which, any viewer of Infinity War can tell you, requires a sacrifice. In one of the more heartbreaking scenes of the movie, Black Widow and Hawkeye, two Avengers with a long history, fight to see who will sacrifice themselves, with Black Widow eventually winning out and falling off of the cliff. I was actually quite disappointed in the way they handled her death. As one of the core Avengers, Black Widow's death should have had much more of an impact, especially on Captain America, Hawkeye, and Hulk, though they spent only five minutes or so on her death before moving on to supposedly more pressing matters. Another problem I had was that they acted as if her sacrifice was the one good thing she was able to accomplish, which essentially erased everything she did in the previous movies. At the same time, the audience is treated to a flashback to 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy, as Nebula and War Machine head to find the Power stone, which is how Thanos, Gamora, and Nebula from the past are alerted to the plan. Thor and Rocket travel to Asgard, in a scene from 2013's Thor: The Dark World to find the Reality Stone. It was quite touching to see Thor interact with his mother, who was killed in Thor: The Dark World, and even better to see Thor reclaim Mjolnir, his hammer. Iron Man and Captain America head to S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters in another attempt to find the Tesseract. The audience is then treated to a scene in which Tony gets to something he's always needed to: speak with his father. In one of the more touching scenes of the movie, Tony is able to thank Howard and tell him how he truly feels, despite Howard not knowing who Tony really is.Once all of the stones are collected, the Avengers head back to the present day in order for Hulk to snap everyone back into existence. Once Hulk does so, Thanos returns for the final battle, which is the CGI army glory that Marvel fans know and love. However, the last battle is one of the best sequences in the movie, and, dare I say it? One of the best in the MCU as well. The audience is treated to numerous tributes to the previous films, such as Captain America finally lifting Mjolnir (a callback to Avengers: Age of Ultron), and Falcon's reappearance with ""on your left"" (a callback to Captain America: The Winter Soldier), and finally, Captain America saying ""assemble"", which I have been waiting for since 2015, also from Age of Ultron. What ensued was an amazing final battle that culminated in one of the most heartbreaking losses of the MCU: Iron Man, the character who brought the MCU to life. Tony steals the stones from Thanos and snaps, dusting Thanos and his army, though he is unable to withstand the power of the Stones and dies shortly after. Tony, as the heart of the MCU, is given a beautiful funeral that pays homage to 2008's Iron Man. Finally, Thor joins the Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America, in a surprising twist, survives the battle and goes to return the stones, deciding to stay and marry Peggy Carter, passing his shield to Falcon instead. While I was happy to see Captain America live out his life with the woman he loves, there were also problems with this. Peggy Carter had previously established herself as a strong female character who was much more than a love interest, as she had her own TV show. She told Steve to live out his life and move on, though he did the exact opposite at the end of the movie. While it was touching to see Captain America finally live his life, it did open up problems with the timelines, as there are now two Captain Americas, which is another reason that the time-travel was a risky choice for a conclusion movie.All of the plot highs and lows aside, the chemistry of the cast, which has been developing since 2008, was phenomenal. It was amazing to finally see all of the characters from all of the movies interact with each other for the final battle. Many people seem to think that Endgame was a poor stand-alone movie, but when watching Endgame, one must consider its purpose. Endgame isn't meant to be a movie on its own. It's meant to serve as a thrilling and emotional conclusion to a 22-part supersaga, in addition to paying ridiculous amounts of fan service. The chemistry between the main cast and everyone else who has been there for the ride since years before, coupled with Alan Silvestri's breathtaking score, makes Endgame one of my personal favorite MCU films to date. There were some beautiful cinematographic shots in the movie as well, and the visual effects were woven seamlessly into the story. One of my personal favorite shots in the movie is the one where Captain America stands alone against Thanos's army. I felt that the scene really captured what Captain America was all about.Of course, even at the end of the movie, the viewers are treated to a highlight-reel of each cast member, even those who barely appeared in the movie. This all culminates in the original six Avengers (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner) signing their names as some of their most iconic scenes play in the background, set to Alan Silvestri's main theme. Finally, as the Marvel Studios logo displays on the screen, the sounds of a hammer hitting metal can be heard. This is a reference to the very first movie in the MCU: Iron Man, as Tony builds his Mark I armor.While it was sad to see the cast act together for the last time, I was satisfied with the ending that each character was given: Hawkeye got to be with his family, Captain America got his dance, Black Widow sacrificed herself for the greater good, Thor began on a new path, Hulk became truly comfortable with himself, and Iron Man accomplished all that he wanted. The movie has plenty of rewatchability (at least to me) and was stunningly done by the Russo brothers. Overall, Avengers: Endgame was the ending that the MCU deserved. While there were flaws (no movie is perfect), it achieved its purpose.",positive
What a huge disappointment. Hulk is a wimp. Thor is a fat drunk. No fight scenes. I am a huge Marvels fan I could not have been more disappointed with this movie. Anyone saying this was great needs to be evaluated.,positive
"Also watched GoT season 8 episode 3 (the long night*) after Endgame;
let's just say I completely forgot about this final avengers movie. Literally that episode of GOT blows this movie away.MANY of the scenes weren't important/forgettable. Infinity War was just better, whatever the Russo brothers were ready to retire, therefore comic movies are going back to being crap.ITS OVER, MCU as we know it will be feminized by Disney and going down the crapper. It was fun while it lasted, btw Captain Marvel is HORRIBLE, the movie, character, everything. Great new dyke haircut.",negative
"This movie was amazing I hav been a fan of marvel for a very long time and I'll admit I was a little let down by infinity war I just thought it was overhyped and I am pleased to say I was fucking amazed by this film. Everything from start to finish I didnt find predictable at all. Great story, great effects and great acting - Chris Hemsworth, RDJ and Jeremy renner especially. The return of all the heroes could not have been any more epic. Although I wished they had another epic Thor entrance with the immigrant song. My favourite part of the film though was the ending with Captain America and Peggy carter dancing in their home it was so beautiful and Took the film to another level I don't think I will ever forget it",positive
"It made me laugh, it made me cry. Will remember endgame forever!",positive
"Didn't expect the ending and cried twice . Really the best decade of my life and I'm so lucky that i grew up watching marvel movies, such a marvelous era and can't believe it's ended . 😭",positive
"This is one best of all the MCU's 22 movies even though I like most of them. This is a very strong dramatic film in which it is the up most importance that you or anyone else watch all the 22 movies to finally understand to this film. The movie start's up from the one before everything is just great (sounding sarcastically) the hero's lost al lot and of course Thanos is being Mr.Mastermind. This is one of the very few Marvel films that sorta push the limit to PG-13 but it's fine and what's very true is that it can make you or someone else cry. I still enjoyed it even though some people the day when it came out tried to spoil the flim. The drama is very down to Earth Like ""Logan"" another great Film, and by God the action is by far the best of this movie. I have the greatest helpfulness that Marvel makes another Gut punching movie. SO GO WATCH IT",positive
It was great but I expect more for the finale. I hope re-release version make it happen,positive
Perfect ending for the mcu brought all 22 films together,positive
"Avengers EndGame starts with the aftermaths of Infinity war(that spidy thing really left me emotional).The movie starts off well and after some time it becomes predictable,but comedy fills that void. There are some really hilarious scenes in the movie and you really gonna enjoy them .
The entire 2hrs of the movie deals with the Time Heist thing, and the last 1hr is the much awaited combat between avengers and Thanos,the mad titan, which was quite clumsy and not that effective than Infinity war. And I didn't felt any emotion while watching the dying of our favourite avenger and I felt like the movie and the franchise should end in any way , so Russo brothers hurried in making that and it was so clumsy. The final battle VFX were not great for a movie like this. So , finally it ended .
And I felt emotional not because of the movie ,but for I'm not going to see these avengers next time. Overall , EndGame is not a bad movie,nor a great. But it's a good movie with some good comedy and drama. (Infinity war stands first)",positive
"This film was greatly executed by Marvel. The story was fun to watch and had me laughing more often than i usually do during films. It was exciting to watch but also very tragic. The deaths of two Avengers really brought tears to my eyes. Marvel did well in choosing Iron Man as the Avenger to snap his fingers in sacrifice. And the funeral scene was very heartbreaking with tears falling from my eyes. The only thing Marvel did wrong was sacrificing Black Widow for the soul stone. Hawkeye should've died. And the end fight scene was long but amazing, seeing every character fight Thanos and his army was exhilarating. I truly enjoyed this film so much.",positive
"It's all about a Marvel movie which takes the same old road to glory: new and old characters all put together, stories that cross one another and turns that we +/- expected. In my humble opinion it doesn't deserve the #5, not even top #100 ...",positive
I really don't understand how people think this film is amazing. I see the absolute bias when it comes to rating nowadays and the worst part is all these fan boys will be following the Russo brothers and rating their terrible films 10/10 each time.This movie makes Infinity War look good ... and that was an absolute mess of a film too. I can't wait to see what kind of complete waste they will come up with next ......,negative
"This movie is by far the best superhero movie of all time , trust me",positive
"Man. This movie was so freaking great that oh man, i have already watched it two times and planning to watch 2 or 3 times more lol or even more XD. But damn, legit movie. Character arcs, infinity saga, and all the other story lines are just so amazing. The movie is 3 hours but didnt feel like three hours. Whats even more funny is that when i watched the movie first time, i was HYPEEEEED. But when i watched the second time, i was even more HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED. I dont know, but i got even more hyped, this has never happened to me when watching a movie. Loved the first hour, second hour was so amazing, but oh man oh man, the third hour was the best comic book moment ever. Man, just nailed it. Kudos to all the people involved with this project. I highly recommend you guys watching this movie or even giving it a shot. 9/10 (this is my highest rated comic book movie XD). BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER. PERIOD EVER.",positive
"The directors did a fantastic job on weaving all the characters all together! A masterpiece! It reminds me of the Return of The King of the Lord of the rings trilogy!But it still got some glitches though! Such as a person killed herself from the past. Does that make sense? And to acquire a hammer from 2013 and that hammer was destroyed in 2017 already, I am gonna freak out man! Did the production crew consult with Kip Thorne about the possibility? And why Captain wasn't worthy in 2015 and all the sudden being worthy in 2019?It's a great movie don't get me wrong! I personally give it a 10!",positive
"It is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. Every character gets the same quantity of attention. It was a beautiful way to end the Avengers series (I think this is the last Avengers movie, but hope that it isn't). C'MON GUYS LETS GIVE THIS MOVIE A 10/10 RATING!!",positive
"An amazing end to this particular universe portrayed on screen. The first predominance of the movie was filled with lots of MCU Easter eggs and funny character moments which was great whilst putting a gentle wrap on numerous MCU stories that had cumulated up till this point. The last predominance of the movie is something new and adds a totally different out take on what we've seen up till this point, my favourite culmination of scenes so far!! Wasn't expecting the ending one bit which is what you want and it pulled on my emotional heartstrings a lot yet I'm excited for what's to come. #Thanosforpresident",positive

"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter Thanos successfully obliterated all the Avengers at the end of the last film, all seemed lost for the survival of the universe. However, it becomes apparent that by travelling through time and collecting all the 'Infinity Stones', they might be able to create a space in time where they will be able to step in from the past and reverse the present. With all the gang lost in limbo after their defeat, they must muster all their strength together once again to save the planet.Despite rave reviews that made the previous Infinity War appear average, I took the sweetest of time getting round to see the even latest addition in the Marvel universe films. You can't manufacture yourself into a comic book nerd, which would appear to be the best course of action to take in the present climate, where superhero movies have become more of an industry than a franchise. The suffix here is Endgame, which is surely what IW was meant to be, especially given the rug pulling, unexpected ending. But, in Hollywood movies, the good guys have always got to win, even if it means bringing them back to life through some ridiculously convoluted, Back to the Future riffing tale.I'm all for action movies with lots of character development and effective backstories, but the Russo brothers here lavish each of their flashy, colourful protagonists with the sort of intimate examination you might expect from Ang Lee, fleshing out their humanity at the expense of any exciting action, which the devotees will be expecting. It's a detrimentally overlong and drawn out affair, that builds up to a big crowd pleasing finale at the end which is worth sticking around for, but has nearly worn you out completely by the time its got there.For these legions of comic book fans that seem to have emerged over the last few years, it's a dream come true. But, for me, it's simply the end that saves it, and it's existence is surprising given what was meant to have happened at the end of the last film. ***",positive
"Not the best movie in the universe. Not adrenaline rush kinda movie. But it is the best ending, the best closure and most satisfying of all time. Got all we need got all the answer. Full range of emotions. This is the PERFECT ENDING FOR Avengers Era.",positive
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is an ambitious cinematic extravaganza and a bittersweet culmination to an 11-year journey, yet it overwhelms so much in the final act that the audiences fail to detect its flaws. The more you think about what happened, the more you find problems.As I clapped, cheered and teared up with the audiences, I understood how the Marvel Cinematic Universe became a mega-franchise that continued to create fervent fans through the power and charm of its heroes. This has the best final act in a superhero film. I got chills all over my body and my jaw just dropped in awe in the spellbinding moments, especially in the final action sequences. This is like the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" and ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" of the MCU: a film as epic as the saga it concludes. Not a single cast member wasted this opportunity by giving an awkward performance. Everyone seemed so into it and recognized the pressure of their character to get that single win over fourteen million possible losses. Most of the humor is also brilliantly-placed compared to other MCU offerings that could not crack a joke well.In its three-hour running time, the film traverses through a very complicated plot, more complicated than its predecessor. As opposed to the relentlessly brash, unending clash in ""Infinity War,"" ""Endgame"" slows down and takes its time to explore grief and the effects of the previous tragic events to the characters. The plan of the Avengers unfolds detail by detail, from practice runs to jokes. Some of the stretched first act can be cut off such as the one-liners and unnecessary character interactions.The film's second act struggled to transition from one mission to another-from one tone to another-which undermined the progression of how a particular mission will conclude. In this ""Back to the Future"" second act, I was ready to deem the film as mediocre and overlong. But once the final battles ensued, the drawn-out build-up truly paid off with action scenes that reminded me of the power of films to create an experience of epic proportions. This is what film as a medium can do, and boy, is it amazing! Terrific action choreography and visual effects in the third act really elevated this film beyond its serviceable middle section.""Endgame"" did give satisfying endings for some of its beloved characters. However, as nitpicky as it may sound, directors Joe and Anthony Russo are too much invested in devising an emotional full stop on a character's story instead of creating a cinematically-cohesive science fiction narrative. A character's story ends satisfyingly even if how it happens didn't really make any sense.This not how Time Travel works, well if we will consider other popular culture works that explored it. There are a bunch of what can be considered as ""plot holes"" (you can find them online) in its time travel story and character conclusions, most of which is felt when the audience says ""what?"" or ""why is he/she there?"" out of confusion watching a scene. I have read a couple of articles that explained these ""plot holes,"" and none of them really resolved them entirely since the explanations are mostly theorizing based on what was just briefly mentioned in the film. Fans can do all their theorizing, but these ""plot holes"" are problems in the film's depiction of events and ideas.Nevertheless, with all its flaws, this is a very strong film due to its sense of awe and ambitious story. Even if I didn't love it 3000, the shock and awe tactic of the Russo brothers still worked.P.S. Captain Marvel was so under-utilized in this film. I was waiting for her the entire time.",positive
"The strongest hero is kept out of the story and did not even explore her powers here..

"One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. The plots really stunned me. It's a filled with everything that a movie should have. Great respect to Joe and Anthony and the full credit goes to the father of MCU, Stan Lee 😍😍😍",positive
"An era just got over. Sure, more Marvel movies are on their way, but an era IS over with the Endgame and you can't deny that.
The way they brought back moments/scenes from the previous movies, it was all so exciting. Few missing pieces shown in the Endgame finally completed the entire MCU puzzle.
Loved it, but I feel Infinity War was a little better than the Endgame.
For me ...
Infinity War: 9/10
Endgame: 8/10
Endgame was a good mixture of several emotions captured in one movie - have to give credit to the creators for this.
I love you 3000, MCU!
MCU got me into the Marvel Comics' world and I have loved every bit of this journey. 🖤
Will miss it dearly.",positive
"Wow. This movie is an emotional roller coaster that doesn't fail to amaze you. The last 2 hours of this movie are just so satisfying and exciting! Near the end when all of the snapped victims came back, my eyes were wide and jaw was dropped! This film is much more satisfying if you have seen more Marvel films, however I can see how a casual fan who has only seen 2 or 3 films could enjoy this a lot too.
My main problem with the movie is the first hour of it. Not that first 15 minutes, but everything in between the 5 year jump and 2012. I understand that the film had to show all of the details about how the remaining avengers coped with the events of infinity war, but did it really have to last an entire hour? The fact that Fortnite is still a thing in 2023 scares me a lot. Also WHY on earth did the Hulk have to dab? Within that hour there are a bunch of failed joke attempts that make this film just slightly under Infinity War in my opinion. Also, the only way out of 14 million for the avengers to beat Thanos, a rat must crawl onto a few buttons? That's a little too convenient.
However other than that, this film is amazing and the final battle is one of the greatest action scenes in film history. Stark's death is one of the most notable cinematic deaths in film history as well.",positive
"Really enjoyed this whilst watching at the cinema, even cried a bit at the end - a real epic rollercoaster ride of a film. BUT. Even walking back to the car, things started to niggle me and I can't stop thinking about them. These things are well documented in other reviews, but my own personal annoyance is - why can't Natasha be bought back? Gamora was also sacrificed at Vormir but a version of her now exists who came from the past, so just go back and bring a past version of Natasha into the present.Opinions and rules on time travel will always be ambiguous, but this movie seemed to mock all existing theories. All a bit convenient really, as Tony didn't have to choose between bringing everyone back and sacrificing his daughters existence.Thor and Hulk were funny and entertaining, but did that justify destroying their characters? Also could Captain Marvel please find some humility (glad that Captain Marvels role was kept to a minimum).To sum up, a really great film, but just try not to think too much.",positive
"WOW! Simply wow! What. A. Film! I can't start to describe all the emotion throughout this film! One minute you are laughing then the next you are in tears! (I ain't ashamed to say 4 times that happened to me!) this is in my opinion the very best film I have ever seen and potentially the best film I will ever see! Words can't describe how amazing this is! Incredible! Amazing! Unbelievable! Fantastic! WOW! Loved it! Absolute loved it!!! All I can say to all the cast, the writers, everyone involved in this journey for the last 11 years is Thank You! Thank you ever so much for this!

This movie is the best superhero movie ever made and the perfect ending to the avengers. For those rating it less than a 10 saying it was confusing and hard to follow. I wonder have you watched every other movie and remember them? Because this movie is not confusing and hard to follow if you are a die hard fan. Maybe for people who only watch each marvel movie once and might have missed a few I can see how some of it might not make perfect sense. But for the die hard fans this movie was perfection.I laughed. I cried like a baby which doesn't happen often in a movie. And then I some how felt at peace with the ending because it really was perfect. Yes some characters arcs were left unresolved but that is because those characters have more movies. For the ones that won't be coming back I'm more than ok with how their stories ended.Thank you Marvel. Thank you Stan Lee. Thank you Russo Brothers. And thank you to the amazing actors. Thank you for keeping my belief in cinema alive and giving me hope that so many more movies can be made. Thank you for inspiring me.,positive
"AVENGERS END GAME REVIEW :-
Marvel took a decade to set the ""End Game"" on high standard and that plan has worked big time. We can feel the buzz, the hype all around the globe. Finally the Final Chapter in Avengers saga is revealed and does it live upto the hype? Yes, it does. Avengers End Game has every freaking element of heavy Commercial entertainer along with moving climax for die hard Marvel lovers and a fulfill end to the journey.End Game was awaited for the one final Slash on the deadliest villain who killed half the universe with just one snap. People were excited to see how remaining superheroes battles with Thanos and do they survive? The script is 180 minutes long which is perhaps the longest film in Marvel Cinematic Universe so as expected it takes time to settle the atmosphere. Unexpectedly, Russo tries some Intellectual kind of stuff to get it right but leaves so many goofs which remains unanswered. After getting it right, since 140 minutes are gone, finally you get to witness what you actually wanted to see in this film from the start. The visually stunning phenomena takes charge and you just can't stop screaming out loud for your favorite superheroes.The climax fight is followed by bit of emotional portion where you have to say goodbye to your superheroes. Marvel ends it good, but is it good enough? Is there anything new to see? Answer is No. End Game is the same Marvel stuff we have been watching since a decade, except that one segment where all the Marvel Superheroes comes together for the first and last time. Russo tried thier ordinary version of Quantam Physics but doesn't explain the theory till the core, in addition they took so much time to set the plot. Overall, Avengers is a complete Winner package and will rule the box office but it is not that High level Cinematic Experience which can be remembered for years. If tou like all the previous films of Marvel Cinematic Universe then this is something more for you, so don't miss it.RATING- 7/10*",positive
"Don't want to be the contrarian, but there were some obvious plotholes that were hidden away by the sheer scale of visual effects and epic action. Watch it for the action, not the plot (which is that of your run-of-the-mill time travel movie).",positive
I've been watching these movies since Iron Man and this was a great way to end the legacy of these characters. It's a long movie but it needed to be to share it's complete story. The ending was uplifting and emotional. Endgame and infinity war make a great duo. Awesome movie!,positive
"This film was too long.
The dialogues were boring and formalistic
Overall it represents the maximum of mediocrity.
It felt pretty much like when you eat too much candy.",negative
"Avengers Endgame. This was the first time I've seen one of these blockbusters in a cinema and the difference - with the latest digital sound and vision - is remarkable. As I watched the unfolding of this three hour of whizz bangs groans and creaks and blasts I was reminded of A S Byatt, which rather surprised me. Ragnarok of course, but it was the underlying Powysian magic of Byatt that led me to seeing something of Wagner, too. I know this sounds pretentious but I am merely giving my thoughts an hour or so after seeing this in the cinema.This is epic and grand mythmaking, and the film thrilled me more than I can say. As a fan of myths, opera, SF and wild fantasy it poured into my head with relentless pleasure.",positive
"What a movie. perfect justice for each character. superb story. 10/10 acting , cinematography , superb movie ever. must watch .",positive
Love everything bout this movie. Newest member Captain Marvel is now my favorite! Her entry in the war is marvelous. You could see her strength ! Thanos couldn't punch her without the stone. Love love love. Iron man will be in our hearts forever ❤ I didn't feel much pain for black widow but on iron man I was like crying,positive
"After 11 years and 22 films, the Infinity Saga finally concludes with Avengers: Endgame. It's truly an experience to watch this in cinema, for the creativity, the emotional impact, surprises, and the fun this film brings. Despite the 182 minute run time, it is excellently paced and rarely has a feeling of dragging out for too long.However, I only recommend this film to those individuals who have watched most if not all of the films prior to Avengers: Endgame in the Infinity Saga. A causal moviegoer may or may not enjoy it, but someone who has followed the saga from the very beginning will most likely appreciate this film for it is the finale after all.",positive

"Ok so to start this is not a bad movie. However it's not the best of the avengers franchise. Only way I can explain it is there seems to be a lot going on without anything really happening.The whole time travel thing makes no sense at all. Although they do try to explain it during the movie all I can say if the way they describe time travel to work is true then half the cast wouldn't exist.....Hulk was better before he became the weird half human half green beast thing....
Thor drunk all the time not cool.Think ideas for what to do with everyone ran a bit thin towards the end.However there is some funny moments. Some good battles and obviously most of the characters are generally awesome.Don't let anything I say put you off but don't expect it to be a good as previous movies.",positive
"First and foremost, want to make it known that I am a big fan of the marvel franchise. The movie held its epic expectation as marvel thrills and captivating contents carries it movie goers to its unsuspected ending that leaves you with a feeling that only we each can explain because... wait! But why did...? (Trying not to be a spoiler alert reviewer) Because I want whoever to have their own firsthand experience themselves. Nevertheless, even with the ending it was marvel and I am yet a marvel fan but not on board with everything as a die heart fan would. But am always ready to suit up! So, what's next Marvel?",positive
"A good movie with not much to go looking for.

Fantastic film with so many characters, It is great to see different sides to some of them.
Marvel passing over the baton, bring on the next generation super hero movies.",positive
"An ending so worthy, it could pick up Thor's hammers... thrice! The MCU could easily stop here, and it would be fine by me. Everything in this franchise is rounded out perfectly, but of course they will keep going till they kill it. But for now, ""Endgame"" is the ending we needed. Now let's see what the future brings...",positive
I liked it but i will give it 8.8 in rating i think infinity war was better movie then this but this movie was also amezing and i recomend everyone watching this.The only things i did not like is how they handle thor i mean fat thor all the way in the movie he was not the thor i wanted from infinity war.and the second thing is hulk i did not like how the handle him.,positive
"#Genius is the only word that comes to my mind when I think about the movie. Moving the story from a crowd favourite #Thanos to superheroes who hardly use their superpower in initial 1hr is biggest narrative risk I seen in ages. From script to direction to acting to conclusion of main characters journey is done perfectly.
I got a sore throat just by cheering (for cameos & for fan favorite scenes), so was the whole theater.
To sum up if you're a #superhero genre lover, this is the Bestest product out there (It was for me).",positive
"I've been a fan for Marvel Cinematic Universe from Day 1. The MCU story is well thought, everything is perfectly connected from the first Iron Man movie.You can definitely see the character development from all heroes especially the six OG: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow. Every movies of each heroes, all have unique style.After a long road of more than 10 years of journey. It all ends with this movie. I personally sad to see my favorite heroes Iron Man dies in this movie, but i'm very happy with the ending.This movie gave me tears & chills. Especially on the last war scene. Hats down to all cast & crew that involve in this movie.",positive
"Its amazing and is the perfect continuation of Infinity War, It's so amazing that ot brings down tears in yoir eyes in more 1 or 2 scenes.",positive
I really prefered the avengers infinity war. This movie was good but sometimes its get very annoying. Some jokes are good. The only point that i like was the end and all the event can cause for the future. I really love what marvel did with the avengers and the whole story behind it. Its very interesting to follow along.,positive
Perfect just one disappointing thing is that there was Fortnite in the movie :(,positive
"This is more built like a traditional movie with a recognizable three act structure than Avengers: Infinity War was. I quite like it overall, but that traditionalism requires an antagonist that isn't really needed, I don't think.The three acts are pretty distinct. The first is almost purely character driven. Our massive roster of heroes has been culled to almost exclusively the original six (Cap, Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye) with a few others (Rocket, Nebula, Ant-Man). Considering the film's length, this gives each character enough time to stand out. I think the decision to jump ahead five years was very smart. The characters have all changed in those five years, and we have to spend time with each of them getting to know them again. We're essentially being introduced to new characters, and the movie takes its time with it. My favorite of these, not based on the introduction but based on what comes later, is Thor.Thor is consumed by his failure to aim just a bit higher when he threw his axe at Thanos. If he had hit Thanos in the head instead of the chest, Thanos would not have performed the snap, wiping out half of existence, so he sits in a small corner of Norway where the remnants of Asgard have established a new home. He plays video games, drinks copious amounts of beer, and yells at 12 year olds who make fun of the rock monster Korg online. He's a sad, fat, king who lords over the small domain he wishes to keep (his living room). We see the other characters in similarly different states. Tony has walked away from a life surrounded by technology and lives in a nice wooden cabin by a lake. Cap leads self-help meetings. Hulk has found equilibrium with Bruce Banner. Black Widow stays in her office, sending other people out to search for Hawkeye who's left home after his family disappeared, killing those he deems worthy of death.It's a surprisingly somber and solid hour of character based storytelling, introducing us to the new rules of a new world with familiar characters who've all changed. The one who hasn't changed is Ant-Man. Scott Lang was trapped in a gobbledygook science state that he thought only lasted five hours but actually lasted five years. He hasn't changed, and it is through his eyes that we mainly see how things have changed. He's also the impetus for the movement that leads to the second act: The Time Heist.I've seen the Time Heist described as fan service, and I can't entirely disagree but I do in part. There's so much more to this than just seeing things from the past that Marvel fans liked from slightly different angles. That's definitely part of it, and we get some standardly amusing quippy humor, especially from Ant-Man, Iron Man, and Cap (""America's ass"" indeed). However, there's a lot more going on especially around Thor. Thor goes back in time (using gobbledygook science that Tony Stark pulls out of nowhere because movie) to Asgard during the events of Thor: The Dark World. The task of retrieving the Beauty Stone becomes completely secondary to Thor's time spent with his mother in a wonderfully touching scene between mother and son where she helps him find his purpose again. It's the sort of emotionally driven scene that believably takes a character from one place and gets them into another. I mean, a tender visit with your dead mom might do just that.Before going any further, you have to talk about this new (old) version of Thanos. Thanos gets his head chopped off in the first sustained sequence of the film, but with time jumping, the older version of the heavy gets introduced. I have to imagine that there's a very early draft of this film that doesn't include Thanos at all past the fifteenth page because Thanos has nothing to do with the central conflict of the story (jumping through time to collect the Infinity Stones). He's purely extra. He shows up after the task is done to fight the world's mightiest heroes and introduce a late, unrelated, obstacle.And that's what the last hour is, an unrelated fight that breaks out in epic style and is just packed full of fan service. The last hour is little beyond that. Every hero comes back when Hulk reverses the snap, and we get an even more concentrated and bigger version of the fight as in the last film. Don't get me wrong, this stuff is fun to a certain degree and well assembled, but the story's effectively over by that point and yet it just keeps going. I loved the movie up to this point, and then I just kind of got deflated. ""Oh, this is what we're doing now, huh?""So, yeah, I loved about two hours of this and tolerated the third. The first two hours aren't perfect (Tony thinking about time travel for five minutes and finding the perfect answer is just the kind of ludicrous that Marvel is permeated with and sort of just bugs me), but the strong stuff there is very strong. It's just kind of too bad that the movie ""needed"" an antagonist shoe-horned in its final act in order to make fans happy.",positive
"There is some amazing cgi in this movie but the feeling of ever smouldering ""I'm going to be a hero"" look soon betrayed the shallowness of this epic ""all for one, one for all"" nonsense.
A score that does not deliver and the utter nonsense logic of ""time interference"" really lost my suspension of disbelief.
I adored the last Thor movie but Holding out for Too many Heroes proved too shallow and nowhere near as Compelling as ""LOTR - Return of the King"".",negative
This movie is fun. Nerding out about the massive 23 film undertaking is fun. The storyline is fun. The character evolutions are fun.End Game is an amazing addition to an already epic collection of movies. Duck the haterz 🦆,positive
"Just wow. I have watched every Marvel movie from the very beginning, and after I literally bawled through the end of Infinity War, I couldn't wait to see how this amazing saga would end in Endgame. And it certainly didn't disappoint. I absolutely LOVED the movie. It had many hilarious moments, great CGI, and some really heartbreaking and heartwarming moments which literally brought me to tears. A true credit to the creators of this film and the actors too. If you haven't yet seen it, ENJOY.",positive
"That was a really good movie.
But... Oh how i miss the down to earth Valerian, more credible and more possible , or even the last episode of GOT whose battle was way more realistic .
And to much PC ! It seems that the producers wanted to please everybody , to pic the dollar from everyone . They forgot that an artist, is presenting his work, the way HE sees it, not the way Will Smith does and want or the Me Too campaigners.
A 8 out of 10 is well deserved, but it could do much , much more with the resources thrown in it.",positive
Exceptional! Run! Don't walk to see this movie! And don't let anyone tell you what happens in it before you see it.,positive
"I have enjoyed almost all of the previous Marvel films - but cannot call myself a superfan (evident by the fact I'm finally watching Endgame after nearly the rest of the world.) But regardless of your emotional investment in the saga - It cannot be denied this a supreme cinematic achievement. In scope and ambition, I can really only compare this with Peter Jackson's ""Return of the King.""I really enjoyed the opening act of the film - the tone is like nothing I have ever seen in a superhero film. They made some BOLD choices here. The Avengers did LOSE the ""Infinity War"" and this film allowed the audience to experience that loss in a way I didn't expect. The plot really took it's time - for a 3-hour film it was brilliantly paced, my attention never wavered once. The beginning was more of a human drama / comedy than an OTT action film. These characters are treated as real people outside of their heroic adventures - rare for a film of this genre. They have dealt with the cataclysmic events of the previous film in various ways - they are all changed people.Endgame deals with themes with surprising clarity and depth - grief, depression, family, regret. They really took some risks when writing this film. Most paid off brilliantly. I absolutely loved Hulk in this film. It's an iconic character, but we have never seen him played in this way - and it was simply perfect. I can't imagine him any other way now - Mark Ruffalo has never been this charismatic. Overall, the jokes mostly landed right - there are more laughs to be found here than in many actual comedy films. I personally found ""Fat Thor"" a bit OTT silly, but Chris Hemsworth made it work. Another stand-out performance within a enormous cast.The acting here is genuinely GOOD. Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey, Jr. especially. They have really thrown themselves into these roles and are giving some of their best work. The film was moving, uplifting, funny, exciting, thought-provoking. Everything you could hope for! Yes, there is fan-service also - but all of it feels earned.Of course the end of Infinity War had left our heroes at a dead-end which could only be fixed in one way - time travel. When films start messing with time, things can get messy. The stakes can seem lowered and plot holes are near-impossible to avoid. Not so here. The concurrent time plot-lines really work together flawlessly - this is especially impressive considering they had to work around (and compliment) a 20-film decade long saga. I cannot imagine the difficulties they had balancing all these factors when writing the screenplay. I hope this is acknowledged come awards season.Most importantly, this was certainly an ENDING for the 'OG' Avengers stars. The film clearly respected this. While still obviously relevant, the newer heroes were allowed to take a backseat. A wise decision - with so many characters and plots to juggle, some had to take centre stage. They chose the right ones. This is even more impressive when compared to another media behemoth coming to an ""end"" now - Game of Thrones. Where GOT has crumbled under it's own weight and expectation - failing miserably. The Avengers have risen to the challenge incredibly. It works on every level.One issue I have always had with these ""extended universe"" franchises is that they never seem to have a definitive ending. A small glimpse of continuation must always be given, to carry on the saga. Not here. The felt like the END of something important. And a damn good one! I do not think the film is PERFECT - but in terms of what the film was trying to achieve, I don't think they could have done better! For me, the best film of 2019 - 9/10 *********",positive
"The final showdown begins in Marvels biggest blockbuster ever! Avengers: Endgame! With a gigantic cast and the Russo's working hard out behind the scenes, can all their vision and determination meet expectations? And also reader beware, you're in for plenty of spoiler scares. If you've not seen the movie yet, don't read this.Plot
Five years after Infinity War, The entire universe lies in turmoil after the events of The Decimation caused by Thanos the Mad Titan. Moving on from their grief, the surviving Avengers led by Captain America and Black Widow assemble for a final time in one last ditch effort to undo the damage left by Thanos.Likes
Avengers: Endgame is a darker, action fuelled, emotional story of a world now devoid of any hope. The Avengers themselves are no better as they are also broken to the core and struggling very hard to move on from their grief. Literally, it is a heartfelt theme that even has us audiences downhearted also with these losses of life.The plot itself is vastly well-written that you can feel a strong connection to it and all of the characters involved. The time travel plot is a nice new direction for the story to go into as well. And not too familiar or clichéd to other movie plots that use the theme.
The stakes are much higher than they were before and the risks are more daring. And every scene and dialogue is just astonishingly well written in. There are plenty of new awesome character interactions just like last time but ultimately better than ever. For example Tony and Nebula bonding together while trying to survive in outer space, Rocket teasing Captain Marvel for her new Hairdo, Hulk negotiating with The Ancient One and Tony getting to talk with his father for one last time. All while packing in plenty of outrageous moments of humour and levity to keep the pace. My favourite funny moments were mainly with Ant-Man doing stuff like attempting time travel and when a spaceship kept killing his burritos!The action and visuals are incredibly filmed and offer a ton of thrills and awe to the mix. Every scene is like a comic book panel coming alive before your very eyes and the action flows clearly leaving an exciting impact on the viewer.
Since there's so many characters that appear in this movie, I'm only going to narrow it to the main cast members.Chris Evans gives us ultimately the best performance with Captain America yet. And continues to show no fault in developing his character. I also loved how he got to pick up Thors hammer in the end and face-off against Thanos with it. Oh and that final Scene where he goes back in time to have that dance with Peggy unlike before in The First Avenger.Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man continues to be the Playboy genius we know and love. And now an aspiring Daddy too. I felt touched at how he got to meet his father one last time and just give him one last hug. Even if his dad never got to know it was him. But still, very touching.Hulk played by Mark Raffalo brings about new and funny Hulk humour and even managed to cure the Hulk within him too. Now he basically is Doctor Hulk! His new persona does remind me a lot of Beast from the X-Men as well.
Well.... Chris Hemsworth's new Thor look did stagger me very much. Where five years later he became a fat and lazy bum who watches his best mates Korg and Meek playing videogames for the rest of his days. But I did find this amusing because you'd expect that Thor is this all-mighty deity with no faults and regrets of his own. And seeing Hemsworth and the directors push Thor to this edge is a great way to see how he is able to overcome these new obstacles. But, for God's sake Thor, please loose that belly in Guardians 3!Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was also a fantastic final performance for the young actress. I was probably more heartbroken for her most when she died in the movie. Though yes, Black Widow is supposed to be a hardened killer, but deep down she was the full heart and soul of the Avengers and seeing her sacrifice herself instead of Hawkeye does get quite depressing because she was a very likable character to me. And also seeing Black Widow not having a family but the Avengers was what makes it worse because she'll never get to have that chance again. It's just so sad...(Sniff) anyway getting off the crocodile tears. And finally the villain himself. Thanos. Josh Brolin continues to bring out a menacing villain who won't rest until balance in the Universe is truly achieved. And actually now that I think about it all, he is much more dangerous than last time and even came close to winning again a second time! Another spoiler sorry! Though I will miss John Brolins portrayal of the character after this, but who knows what the future MCU instalments will bring.Honestly, all of the cast is good, from Ant-Man, to Captain Marvel, To Rocket, To War Machine, To Nebula, the supporting and minor cast members. Even the ones that returned from the dead in the final battle are all so good.
Nearly everything in Avengers Endgame is just so fantastic you could just almost call this one completely flawless for a superhero movie. But oh no, we're forgetting one thing though. The flaws themselves... Read on...Dislikes
So the dislikes are nearly the same as Infinity War, its predecessor. So let's just go to my biggest offenders.The running time is still a problem for me like most of the other MCU movies. At a whopping 185 minutes this is enough to rival the run time of Return of the King. And it can get tiring most times when a few scenes drag on for a long time with too much exposition being its main cause. But, what the hell should've I expected, this is the Avengers finale. Of course it needs to be long! Still with the amount of likes above, the time does seem to fly by quite quickly for the most part. But I'm saying, 3 hours is pushing it for me.Unlike infinity War the character perspectives are far more improved but still this film continues to be TOO crowded. Especially in the final act. SPOILER WARNING when many of the characters are resurrected and gather to the Avengers Facility to battle Thanos, it became SUPER crowded all of a sudden. Though like I said it did handle how it executed the use of them in the final battle. Working together in groups and all like a footfall pitch. But still, it feels a bit jarring trying to keep a direct focus on where the true perspective lies.And also, Korg plays Fortnite in this movie. By 2023 (As the rest of the film is set 5 years later) I already imagine the game would be extremely outdated by then and many people may have already moved onto other Battle Royal games or other trends. So, yep, very pointless product placement.Verdict?
Not since Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings has a film series left such a large impact on the world. With a record-breaking gross of over a billion in its first opening weekend, The Russo brothers deliver you the spectacular finale to this Avenging Saga that we all wished for! With plenty of Story, action, suspense and emotion to sink your teeth into, Avengers Endgame is by far the best finale to a Superhero film series ever! But will the MCU be able to achieve so much more after? We have yet to be sure. But whether it be the New Avengers, The X-Men, The Fantastic Four, The Guardians of the Galaxy or X-Force that steps up to fill in their shoes against the next big bad, you can be sure that none of them will ever have a finale as epic as this one!
Avengers Endgame receives 9½/10!",positive
"I was so excited for this film but came out a bit meh. The first 2 hours are hard work. Theres no actual beginning. Think they should have started it with the IW end scene. Theres no connection to that. Captain Marvel is just there and no announcement about who is she, where did she come from. And she actually seems a bit pointless tbh. Needed her in the beginning and after that they could have got by without her. And theres no footage of what the world is like since the snap. Everyone is just depressed. Quite a few hundred plot holes in it too. Time travel is a difficult thing to work with and get right.
Felt the timing was off too. They built up the scene to be really emotional and then theres a random joke and the moments killed. Why!? Only started to enjoy it in the last hour where there actually was some major action. But even that still felt like it was just repeating the ending of IW just reversing it.
Although Cap becoming worthy of holding the hammer (which we knew he could do anyway) got a humongous response from the audience. Especially the 12 year old on front of me who almost popped with excitement. Think they ended it right though. Felt like the right time to end certain characters. Dont get me wrong it was a great film but I wont be watching it again until I have the DVD. Unlike IW which I saw at least 4 times in the cinema. Very over hyped I think.",positive

"There is one good thing about this film which is that it negated the awful ending to the abominable piece of utter trash that was the movie to which it is a sequel Infinity War. And that's actually not saying much.So let's talk about Endgame, the good, the bad and the ugly.The Good
1) A lot of the comedy lands mostly derived from the Incredible Hulk and Ant-man.2) It did a good job portraying Hawkeye's trauma and response to it.3) The heroic sacrifices of Black Widow and Iron Man were quite well doneThe Bad
1) The Incredible Hulk's character arc is completely resolved entirely offscreen instead of being something that we the audience are never shown but are only told about despite it being built up in previous films.2) Even though Iron Man blames himself for Spider-Man's death on the grounds that he was the one whose idea it was to recruit him into the Avengers and put him in harm's way in the first place after Spider-Man's resuscitation, he again does the exact same thing.3) While Thor's trauma from Infinity War makes sense and is well done when he kills Thanos, it ends up being transformed entirely into a joke even though the movies were willing to take Iron Man's trauma seriously in Iron Man 3 and Black Widow's trauma seriously in Age of Ultron.4) Pepper Pots becoming a superhero seemed completely out of nowhere.5) Despite being hyped up as the saviour of the Marvel Cinematic Universe by the post-credits scene of the last movie, Captain Marvel does practically nothing of value within it.The Ugly
While this movie is willing to acknowledge that Thanos is a sadistic thug ""throughout all the conquests, all the massacres, all the slaughters, it was never personal but when I destroy your world, I'm going to enjoy it"" and acknowledges him as a megalomaniac to the point where he seeks to destroy the entire Universe and replace it by creating a new one to worship him. All of that was good, though I wish one of the characters were willing to point out how that undermines his original plan to save the universe from itself and realize that despite all the rhetoric Thanos was nothing but a brute concealing pure bloodlust behind a pitiful excuse for a political ideology. I get that they were going for subtlety but here I wish it were more explicit.As to the Time Travel plot. The movie is inconsistent in letting us know what the stakes are. After Iron Man and Hulk build their time machine, Hulk reveals that nothing they can do in the past will in any way affect the present to which they return. Which is a cheap copout. Fortunately, that's rectified when The Ancient One reveals that changing the past won't alter their own present but will create alternate realities that simultaneously co-exist with the main universe as their own separate timelines and ones whose histories will be impacted. And as such if the people of those universes don't have the Infinity Stones when the time comes they'll be doomed which is why it becomes so important for them to return the Infinity Stones to the times from which they were taken. While that does create stakes the Avengers still mess with the past willy nilly as part of their poorly planned time heist and are certain to create several alternate realities in so doing several of which are certain to have problems as a result of that fact and none of the Avengers are ever called out on this.Also, using time travel to bring 2014 Gamora to the present so as to negate her death was a lazy plot device. Ditto for Loki.There were some redeeming aspects to the film, Nebula's defeat and execution of her evil past self, Hulk unleashing the Infinity Gauntlet, Captain America wielding Mjolnir as well as Cap returning to Peggy Carter to live happily ever after. Thor joining the Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm not a fan of Valkyrie becoming ruler of Asgard instead of Thor but all the ending is pretty good. And I actually do appreciate the fan service the film exhibits though I acknowledge its excessive reliance thereupon.So it's a mediocre film. But it's infinitely better than what preceded it.",positive
"The curtain call of the Avengers is entertaining if painfully convoluted and long. Unlike most of its predecessors, ""End Game"" is over done in the same vein as the Star Wars franchise. It's a disappointment compared to most of the prior Marvel films. I own most of those movies on Blue Ray. I will not be purchasing either of the last Avengers films.",negative
"Well this movie is an experience, like for a moment you like it and for a moment you think, am i just fanboying? The reason is the plot holes created due to the time travel plot device. Overall the stakes are high, but are they really? Too many plot conveniences, contradictions with the early established facts and all that stuff in the storyline.
If you go in to enjoy the final battel, you'll get all yours hungry ass needs.
And Tony's character arc with other original avangers was full circle, i just loved it.
But more i think about the movie as a whole, it makes lesser sense.I might be wrong, but here is one of the
many examples.The ancient one says that removing even 1 infinity stone can disturb the timeline coz we all know that these stones are basically binding the existence of the universe, they were even before the existence of the universe or singularity.And hence Captain America goes back in time to keep the stones from where they were taken.
But it doesn't change the fact that in the main MCU timeline, thanos distroyed all of the infinity stones and the world is just fine. Nothing happens for 5 years so far. And yes Dr. Strange doesn't have his time stone now.And Captain America has to keep the stones back at the exact same time in the past where they were taken, but it's not possible because when cap will go back at the exact same time to return the stone, the ancient one will already have a time stone. It will create a paradox anyway in the main timeline irrespective of other immerging alternate timelines.I think they should have completely omited the time travel as a plot device beacuase then nothing is on stakes and it results in a lot of plot holes which makes a movie with a ton of potential, dumb.
They could have used the Adam werlock storyline or something els but time travel, coz it's just cliché. Everything setup in infinity war becomes less impactful.And for that reason it's a 7.5/10 as a whole for me.
But for the conclusion, it's a 10/10.Infinity war > Endgame.",positive
"The movie was funny, interesting and full of action. My favorite scenes were of Thor which were hilarious. But I do have a couple of complaints which is why I knocked off of a couple stars. First, the movie was just too long and felt unnecessarily dragged out. It slowed the pace of the movie and made it pretty dull at times. Second, they didn't quite explain the science well enough into what they were doing. I feel like they could have cut other moments from the movie and dived more into that, but I'm guessing it would have been too complicated. Also at the end of the movie, Thanos comes from the past into the future, significantly altering that particular timeline. Also, Gamora was brought back from the past too. So I'm guessing that didn't affect their timeline, but a different timeline? ok....",positive
Actually liked infinity war better but I find this movie awsome .,positive

"I am not particularly a huge supporter of superhero movies. But I believe that Avengers Endgame was one of the best movies of the year. The plot, the cinematography, character development; it was all there. From beginning to end I was on the edge of my seat and filled with emotion.
Good job, Marvel.",positive
"The best Avengers by far. Unique, entertaining, emotional and just so well done. Very impressive.",positive
"It's been a long, fruitful eleven years for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and never has that been more apparent than in this, the true culmination of that protracted journey. Engame is a die-hard crowd pleaser, going above and beyond to check every box on the wish list, sometimes even to its own detriment. We get resolutions and payoffs to dozens of dangling threads, not to mention years' worth of fan service, while flashing back to the preceding films in a way that doesn't feel exploitative or redundant. Character moments abound, always a hallmark of the Avengers franchise, but where in the past it was enough to merely watch the big personalities bounce around a room, this time we see a tremendous logical change in each of them.The plot suffers from pacing issues, leaves behind a whole slew of gaping holes and tends to over-rely on twists and misdirection where the expected route would've been much cleaner. It can feel disappointingly blunt at times, then surprisingly subtle and nuanced in others. At some points, more than a few, you'll feel that the Marvel slate has never been more forced, never cheesier. In others, you'll be shocked to realize you're still watching a superhero movie. It's not as smooth as the MCU's best, nor as efficient, nor as visually ambitious, but when it gets where it's going the results are spectacular. I credit that more to the decade of careful planning and coordinated execution than I do to this film in particular, though points are certainly due for sticking the landing.When I found myself walking away from the cinema, contemplative and maybe a little bit shell-shocked, I experienced a strange mix of calm, relief and fulfillment. I wasn't amped up like a Rocky movie. I hadn't been through something titillating or epic, an instant classic that I'll assuredly watch over and over again. I just knew that it was over, I was cool with that, and I was satisfied by the closure. This iteration of the team went out on a high note, but not its highest. The perfect ending, if not nearly a perfect film.",positive
"It is truly the epic ending that was promised. The reward of ""fan service"" (if you will) of the studio and the vision of Kevin Feige for the fans that have seen 23 movies during 11 great years. The movie literally does what it wants with the laws of time travel, it is not 100% coherent and it changes the core of characters like Thor and Hulk but it is probably the best movie out of all of the MCU. You will laugh, cry, laugh again, awe as the heroes you grew up with change and perform. Good villain, good plot, the 3 hours don't pass slowly since the movie is well paced. The last 30 minutes are pure epicness.",positive
I won't spoil the movie but here's what it is in short.It's not extremely action packed but it does have an amazing fight. It's logic is inconsistent at times and it's kind of irritating. Don't inflate your expectations for this film because you won't walk away satisfied.,positive
"Avengers Endgame - what a disappointment. Too long, too boring and too sappy. What was I watching - soap opera?
Low on action, full on drama, corny dialogues about friendship and family.
The hall was supposed to be houseful according to bookmyshow and PVR, bullshit, it had less than 1/4 seats full.
Something very fishy is going on.
Totally anti climactic after Infinity Wars and Thor Ragnarok. The direction Marvel has chosen after Captain Marvel and Now this. Seems like films are statistically driven now, with an eye on how to make the film click - by hook or crook.
Captain Marvel - Woman driven, here too there is one scene clearly pushing that agenda. In the last battle there is a shot where all the woman get together for the final fight - just by chance.
The entire focus for this move was, high on emotions, must have done some calculations for that is what the box office collection tell.If I had got an honest review I would have given this movie a skip, you should too.",negative
"I'm sure everything about this movie has already been said, but it doesn't deserve a rating of 9 just because fans want it to hit records.if it didn't get labelled as the most amazing movie of our generation, I would have rated it higher. I went into the cinema expecting some huge fight scenes that lasted a lot longer, with better use of their powers, and teamwork with everyone included. However the final battle seemed rushed and a lot of people who deserved to shine didn't get to.The Russo brothers told us that they couldn't cut it shorter than 3 hours, but there were a lot of useless scenes used for comedic effect. This would make the first half of the movie really drag on if you love the franchise because of all it's action.I understand that you can't please everyone, but it feels like this was made mostly to please the majority of the fans who wanted a happy ending, thus losing their focus on making a complex story without continuity errors.I feel somewhat disappointed that Thor and/or Hulk barely got to show their new potential. They stripped away Thor's power to make people laugh, and I would've been okay with it if he was only like that for a portion of the film, and not the whole thing. There should have been better character development for him and the Hulk. How amazing would it have been for Hulk to be able to cause the same amount of damage but in a smarter way, and for Thor to go from feeling the worst he's ever felt to finally getting his vengeance.They chose the lazy solution of time travel and they didn't even plan the easiest way to acquire the stones, instead of time travelling to the point where thanos was in deep sleep, before Peter woke him up, they decided to time travel to a few iconic moments and scenery from past movies to make the audience feel nostalgic. After all it was the end of that phase.They focused a lottttt on the emotive side and tried to give the characters the ending that they thought they deserved, so much so that it feels like it's lacking in other major areas. We wanted Thor with his pent up anger, Hulk's revenge, and those who got killed by the snap to come back and give us an insane visually mind blowing scene.Definitely a lot of plus sides from this movie, like the graphics and acting, but also a lot of continuity errors, confusing, and boring moments too.To me it's just not worth a 9.",positive

"Endgame is the Culmination of 21 movies over 3 phases in a span of 11 years. And what a conclusion it was. The Story arc for the main characters have been beautifully completed in this one and also setting up new arcs for other characters. This film will definitely fulfill all the expectations of the fans of the movie and even the comic books. It has moments of laughter, joy, and utter thrill. Mixed with emotional ones too. When dealing with time travel the directors have an immense task of not screwing it up. Nonetheless, Russos have kept it clean and slick even though it leaves a few plotholes. But, this surely is their greatest work, yet. And onw of the best movies to have ever come out in cinema history.",positive
"Let's just say that there are plot holes and plot devices that are a tad too convenient. That said, it's a great wrap to a great franchise; far more coherent than the DCEU anyway but simply not solid as LOTR.It's a feel good movie, which at points seems like advertisment for other movies of the last decade. Yet because they have generally done well, it's a nice journey and deserved endorsement for the studio.",positive
"First off, I am a fan boy and lifelong comic lover. With that said, this movie was personal to me and truly felt like watching my family on the screen. Marvel Studios and Disney did such an amazing job piecing so many movies together to get us here. The anticipation was huge and properly met. This movie was epic and although it had some plot holes, mostly intentional I think, the closure so many characters reached (as well as the loyal fan base with this being the epic conclusion to the Avengers Saga) makes it a true, emotional rollercoaster of a masterpiece! This was everything I hoped for and had plenty of surprises fans hadn't guessed. Great movie and I will rewatch this time and time again!",positive
"Avengers is easily the most hyped film this year. In reality it is somewhat decent and a big improvement on Infinity war. The heroes assemble to bring back their loved ones and defeat Thanos. Thanos makes a great villain and there are some good fight scenes in here. Endgame also offers some closure for the universe and ties a lot of ends together especially Captain America. The pacing seemed a bit slow and again Thano's motivation or goal is never fully explored. He now wants to destroy the full universe instead of half, quite cliche. More humour could have helped since Marvel have made a name for themselves by adding humour. I do not think this is the best film in the franchise by a long shot.I believe many of the fans in the universe who laugh and clap nonsensically at every scene voted 10s over here. Overall not bad but this is more a 7/10",positive
"Tear jerker at one point or another, but one of the best marvel movies in awhile.",positive
"Endgame is the conclusion of the Infinity War saga and ultimately also Avengers as have been played out for the last decade or so and in that context it is an unsatisfying ending. One that seems to be more about setting up new heroes for the future than playing out a compelling storyline and give a satisfying ending.Without going too much into detail the aspects where it is unsatisfying is how it treats existing and loveable characters as well as inconcistencies and plot holes. For example:Thor, who has been evolving a lot since the first Thor movie, is reduced to a sad figure who is both mentally and physically beaten and is pretty much relegated to a comical relief role and does not accomplish much in Endgame. An insulting way to treat such a central character in both the Infinity War and MCU in general.Hulk is magically transformed to Banner Hulk but with very little explained and showed as to why and he is not seen in the final fight, thus not redeeming himself from the humiliating defeat in Infinity Wars.Scarlett Witch is super-powerful and she can apparently single handedly defeat Thanos. But if that is the case then why didn't she do that in Infinity Wars? A huge plot-hole imo.Black Widow could not be brought back for ""reasons"" yet Gamora could? Makes no sense other than they wanted to get rid of Black Widow but wanted to keep Gamora for future movies.And this whole plotline(s) with time-travelling just feels confusing and unsatisfying that I don't feel made much sense. If they had access to time travelling then why did they not use that in Infinity Wars? Was that a revelation that just suddenly came into existence in Endgame because Ant Man had a eureka moment? Apparently so. And Thor got back his hammer from an alternate timeline but then what would happen with Thor in that timeline where he would no longer has his hammer?Then you had other aspects that felt forced. Such as shoe-horning in Captain Marvel and Pepper Pots as key combatants (most likely for future MCU movies). So all in all I would say that Avengers: Endgame is a cool action flick but not a good ending for the greatest era in MCU.",positive
"Seriously I am actually convinced now that nobody in the industry knows how to write an ending. they are so focused on leaving plot opening for a possible future opportunity that they cant give a satisfying ending!
Game of thrones and the decline of Stranger things to mention a few.",negative
"I think i have never laughed or cried as much as i did when i saw this film. It's the end of an era.

Despite these flaws i still really enjoyed this film and i recommend you to watch it again.",positive

"With 22 films and over a decade of storytelling coming to a close, Avengers Endgame had a lot to live up to, and despite some logic gaps and a handful of plot holes, it succeeded in the most important thing it needed to do, wrapping up a story that fans who spent all this time with these characters could be satisfied with. Last years Infinity War left these superheroes at their lowest point, defeated, and struggling to cope in the wake of the Mad Titan's victory. Because of our obsession with internet news and the constant need to be informed, those fallen heroes fates were never really in question, knowing full well another Spiderman movie was on its way, with both the Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther having new movies in development. That left Endgame with not the if, but the how it was going to save these characters. What followed was a three hour mega opus that dwarfs even the biggest of comic book movies. Avengers Endgame is at times hilarious, and others heartbreaking, with returning directors Joe and Anthony Russo guiding the film with equal parts fun and heart, culminating in a poetic end to this sprawling storyline. It is the ultimate experience of pure fan service, awarding those who have been along for the ride with numerous callbacks to previous moments and wrapping it all up with the most expansive comic book battle ever put on film. To watch that final act without anything but a smile on your face or a tear in your eye makes me wonder why you went to the theater in the first place. Endgame was made for the fans and to criticize it for anything other than a fun time at the movies is missing the whole point. Are there plot holes? Sure, with any time travel plot it is bound to happen, but time travel isn't real, so pretending there are rules because you learned them in Back to the Future doesn't really make a lot of sense. Endgame delivers on everything it set out to do, wrapping this chapter of the MCU up in the most meaningful of ways. Maybe it doesn't take the risks that Infinity War or The Winter Soldier took, but it will be remembered for the experience that it was, and for this comic book movie fan, that is all I wanted from it.",positive
"O melhor filme de todos os tempos misturando drama,humor e ação de uma forma perfeita com o melhor final de todos os tempos.",positive
"This film is incredible!!! I do dislike Captain Marvel, here character is ridiculously over-powered to the point she makes the GOD of thunder look weak. However, she is barely in the film and I'm glad it focuses the OG avengers high-lighting their personal sacrifice and struggle in the fight against tyranny. This film effectively ties some loose ends with an impressive attention to detail but still leaves space for the Marvel universe to continue to grow and continue to brighten our lives. You could only dislike this film if you have no investment in the previous 21.",positive
"In my opinion, Infinity War is the best Marvel movie, not this one. I enjoyed the long runtime, as this is the last avengers movie, however they did not take advantage of that. The movie took a very long time to get going and they rushed all of the action into the end. All the characters that were brought back had almost no screen time because they all had to share it in about 40 minutes.The main thing that I didn't like was that the movie was immature. The jokes were great, as they always are in a marvel movie but maybe this time they went a little overboard. This was supposed to be the conclusion of a decade of movies but it was overshadowed by some of the immature jokes. The one I hated the most was that Thor was fat for the whole movie. It was funny at first but I feel like they could have made him fit again at the part where he summons the lightning and his armor at the end. Also I didn't like how Bruce was the Hulk the whole movie. Like Thor, he should not have been like that for the entire movie.The relationship between Hawkeye and black widow was great and the Budapest line was a nice touch, as the movie can't full circle. Black widow's death however was brushed over in way and once again overshadowed by Tony's death.Another big problem is that the ending didn't make a lot of sense. After everyone was snapped back to life, they were put in a world that had turned into a wasteland after five years, where everyone had aged but they didn't. How is it that Peter just goes back to school the next day as if nothing had happened? Not only should half of his class mates be 5 years older, but the school would most likely not even function, as all the governments of the world collapsed.Finally, during this movie we saw the immense power that the infinity stones have all together. If they were used to wipe out half of all life, bring them back, then wipe out Thanos's army, then can't they also bring back Tony and Nat?In conclusion, I enjoyed watching this movie very much. I just feel like the movie was more serious and dark, like Infinity War was. Putting all these points aside, I would definitely recommend this movie to people and would watch it again myself.",positive
"1st I want to say that while quickly scanning the reviews, I happened across multiple, as in probably 5-6 reviews saying things like, ""the entire theater was crying"", OR ""full grown men were balling like babies"".AND my personal favorite... ""The movie was soooo good that 3 different times throughout the film! THE ENTIRE audience stood up giving a standing ovation!!""......
SERIOUSLY?!? We get it, you think it's a good movie. But just quit all the drama already!.... These comments are just creepy! Yeah, the entire theater stood up, in the middle of the movie no less, and everyone clapped.. Then got back up 30 min later to do it again! Oh yeah, and for good measure, got up to clap at the end too!!.. I mean come on, what's the point of wasting space and time in the comments making up and lying about this kind of stuff?? I just really don't get it, like at all. Just say it's your favorite and move on.And now that I finished with my rant lol....
Like everyone else said, it is a good movie.. Definitely one of the better ones.. Although I feel a few details should have been worked out better and thought through a little more. Even with how good this movie was, I think it could have been even better, possibly even a lot better! Don't get me wrong, it is a very good movie, one you can watch more than once.. I just think some parts didn't quite match up to the narrative of all the previous ones.. For example, most of the characters behavior and actions have been pretty consistent throughout the years but then they act completely different in the finale.. Just a little too much of a change for multiple characters!",positive
High hopes for this one but a bit of a let down Im sorry to say.,positive
"I have to start of by saying that i'm not the biggest Avengers fan but i really enjoyed Infinity war. I saw the movie on the new Odeon Imax theather in Oslo and i was blown away in every aspect. Not only was the 3D effects better than I had ever seen, the movie it self was awsome. I could write on and on about all the obvious reasons to why Infinity war was great one but what hit me the most was the nice pace and tempo of the movie and besides the plot worked well. Compared to Endgame which in my opinion is a very slow movie. The Avengers kept on talking and talking on and on.. and then they plotted and then they talk some more about what they where plotting. I mean the action never came. For me what makes the avengers movies good is the pace of the movies and their ability to solve problems on the go. This one didn't have that it's to stationary, to slow to whiney.
All of that though would be fine had the plot worked, but it didn't, it was to far fetched and it felt like it was rushed. They dug a hole they couldn't climbe out of. After two hours with no action i lost my patient and walked out of the theater. I'm not saying it was that bad but i just didn't feel it and i was left pretty much very dissatisfied.",negative
"Endgame was brilliantly executed giving a perfect end to an already perfect Avengers series and a great conclusion to 22 Marvel movies.It starts slowly, but that's because the story develops. Everything else the cast, characters, cinematography was impressive.Highly recommended.Will miss Marvel movies after the last movie in Marvel Cinematic Universe (Spiderman: Far from Home)",positive
"Just got back from seeing Endgame for the second time. The first time I was blown away by everything and was left in a daze for a day or two afterward. After reading some negative reviews I wanted to go back and watch it again, just to be sure it wasn't all just in my head.Thankfully, it wasn't. I was still blown away by this epic movie, that I don't understand all the hate that surrounds it. Perhaps because they were by some who haven't followed the story from the beginning. But this movie delivers a finale like none other. It's everything you hoped for and hoped you would see and then some.Of course the movie is not flawless, but most movies, even greats, have their moments. There were a couple small details that irked me just a little bit when the credits rolled, main one being why isn't Nebula's 2023 self destroyed when she kills her 2014 self? But I am hoping that question will be answered as Phase 4 of the MCU begins, which is heavily hinted towards throughout the movie if you pay attention. Even Professor Hulk hints at it at the end, where we will possibly see different dimensions and space time continuoum interrupted.My only other small complaint would be when the women of the MCU rally behind Captain Marvel in an ""women empowerment"" movement shot. I think the directors were aiming for honoring and showcasing the women superheroes to give them a shining moment, but it kind of backfired and gave off a vibe kind of like the awkward hug between Voldemort and Malfoy in Harry Potter- a little awkward and painful to watch. Good try guys, but didn't quite get it right.The thing that does it for me in movies though, is the ending. It's that feeling you're left with when you walk out of the theater that gives you a lasting impression. This movie so delivers that: the final battle is awe inspiring, and victorious finally being able to see the entire Avengers cast assemble together in one epic scene (something fans have waited for since the beginning of the MCU) and the original founding Avengers finding an ending to their story. Even Iron Man's ending, though extremely sad and never want to see a hero die, felt very satisfying. Not in a way of ""oh I'm so glad he died I hated him!"" kind of way, but in the sense of we've seen his character story arc, we've seen his growth, he saves everyone and dies a hero. It felt final but very satisfactory, especially since Tony Stark started out as such an arrogant self centered guy and ends up sacrificing himself to save the universe. Same goes with Captain America, who is able to finally grow old and live a full happy life with the woman that he loves. Sad to see him go, but still satisfactory.
A HUGE applause to everyone involved: the cast was perfect and executed their performances brilliantly (Bravo Josh Brolin! For delivering a terrifying yet somehow relatable villain!) Big congrats to the Russo brothers for directing four successful films, the producers who saw it from the beginning, and of course thanks to Stan Lee, who gave us the stories to begin with. Thanks for giving us the superheroes we know and love. Awesome movie! 10 out of 10",positive

"I have been a fan of the Marvel Universe for years, and this wrapped up the story for me better than I could possibly have hoped for. I have never been so in awe during a movie as I was for the entire last hour of this one. I also looked at some of the (few) bad reviews here and I seriously think that many people just didn't follow the story correctly, which is why they didn't like it. SPOILERS BELOW REGARDING THAT!The time travel here is specifically described such that changing the past doesn't change the present or the future; it just creates another timeline. This is as logical a view of time as I have ever seen, avoiding the paradox that comes from a Back to the Future type time travel explanation (you went back and changed something, but now you don't exist in the same way as you did before, so the version of you that made the change never comes to exist!). Side note: by no means a criticism of BttF - I love that too. People who point out Loki's disappearance and how they ""ignore"" its effects don't seem to fully understand this. There is another timeline feeling the effects of Loki's escape, but it has no impact on the timelines we see from that point onward.Overall, a stunning culmination of over a decade of MCU films with brilliant references galore and an incredibly beautiful final scene for those who have been a part of this magnificent ride for so long.",positive
"A must see...CGI was outstanding, acting great! The heroes made you love them even more. What a ride, so glad I jumped on board.",positive
"With a story arc building for over a decade, the audiences packed into sold out movie theatres across the globe knew they were about to witness something special: boy were they right!Over three years on and this movie still has me crying with laughter; sitting on the edge of my seat, gasping with astonishment; even shedding a year in sorrow as I say goodbye to some of most captivating characters to ever bless the franchise: a true roller coaster of emotions.Yes some my argue that the run time is long and unnecessary; however, with the many twists and turns in its dynamic storyline, it hardly feels like any more than a couple of hours - and the most wonderful couple of hours at that.",positive
"The anticipated sequel to Avengers: Infinity War and we're truly in the Endgame now. Having a three hour movie made the directors make the best movie they could, it's an emotional road as the cast and crew had teased but it's handled well. It starts off slow paced but thanks to the cast and writing crew we get some of MCU's best drama, with the long running time we get to see multiple of character arcs, great ones at that and it's mostly because of the directors and writers as they know the characters inside and out.The ensemble cast is not as large as in Infinity War but it is what I personally found great with it as we get to really delve into the characters, seeing and feeling their emotions. They all just have so much chemistry, the whole ensemble and it's because of the friendship and all years of working together, it's what ultimately makes the movie the great movie that it is, the characters and actors playing them. There is so many great moments in this movie, character moments and just Easter eggs and nods to past movies, there's something for everyone that will make you fanboy as it's in a way a love letter to the characters. Almost all characters have been developed so carefully and perfect it's just a blessing to see them in this movie, simply stunning work to everyone that's worked on making the characters and MCU work. Strongest acting was from Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson, their performances are some of the franchise's best. To finish off the review I'm going to rate the final battle, it's amazing in so many ways. Shot and edited with perfection.But the film isn't perfect, far from it but I would lie if I didn't say it was a great conclusion to the Saga we have followed since Iron Man. Avengers: Endgame is probably one of the most anticipated movies of all time and the speculation and theories made it almost impossible to satisfy every person and it was also hard to top Infinity War that was superb. I don't want to spoil the plot but there were a couple of things I really disliked but you are in for one hell of a ride and will probably enjoy this superhero film.",positive
"Avengers: End Game has made me cry, laugh, and got me pumped up. I like how we finally got to see professor hulk on the big screen and not just in the comics and showed how badly Thor had fallen giving the god of thunder himself a beer belly and a double chin, although hard to see with all that beard in the way. It got emotional too. It showed Hawkeye's family when the snap happened, then Hawkeye tried to sacrifice himself to get the soul stone but Black Widow wouldn't allow that and she sacrificed herself. The final battle was probably the most intense battle in the MCU with characters like doctor strange, Spiderman, the guardians of the galaxy and many more appearing and helping them win. Another character from the comics we got to see is Pepper Potts wearing the Rescue suit. In the end Tony Stark basically sacrificed himself to save the other by killing Thanos and his army with a snap having got the infinity stoned earlier. Oh and also Cap went back in time to leave the infinity stones and just stayed there until he grew old and lived his life happily ever after. Oh yeah and I forgot to say that Thor chopped Thanos' head off earlier on in the movie. THE END",positive
"OK I know there's a lot of hype for this movie but when you look past the fact that we've all been super excited because we've been waiting for a long time and you stop to think about what you just watched, there's a whole bunch of things that don't make sense. The effects are insane the movie itself is beautiful but I really hate the storyline and how they decided to go with it.",positive
"Went into this very excited, came out very disappointed. The worst avengers film, possibly the worst marvel film. It was incredibly boring the only reason I'm giving it a 3/10 is the battle scene that was the only entertaining part of the film. I don't get all the hype around this film. The visual effects are amazing (just like all marvel films). It tries to be emotional, but it's very predictable and it failed to do that for me. 3/10 very overrated.",negative
"My favourite comic book movie of all time! It's an absolute crowd-pleaser, and it's a great sendoff to the 21 Movies that led to this masterpiece. It takes place directly after the events of Infinity War, and we see the emotions surging through everyone at the start of the film, with Steve feeling like he failed everything, and Tony losing 'the kid'. As the movie goes along, it gets more and more suspenseful, and the whole 'Killing Thanos, and him coming back from 2014' thing was so surprising for me, and the way they portrayed real depression with Thor getting overweight was awesome! And I think this is the film that made me cry the most, as it has a lot of tearjerking scenes, like Natasha's Death, which took me by surprise. Everything that happens has meaning and emotion behind it, and when we finally get to the third act with the final fight beginning, I was so ready! And that fight with Thor, Steve and Tony VS Thanos was just perfection and one of the best scenes in comic book movie history! When we got the fallen heroes come back, I shed many tears, and them ending the film off with Tony sacrificing his life was absolutely depressing but it felt right with these 11 Years of Buildup. I Love This Movie 3000, and it is just perfect!",positive
"Bye bye Avatar! :) Endgame come to you! Your 9 year first place come to end next week!
But this movie: Great end these 22 movies.",positive
"After ten years, we're finally through with the Infinity War Saga/Marvel's Great Experiment.To say I was emotional is an understatement, I laughed, I cried, and I cheered.There were major issues I had with the plot and major questions I had about the future, but that doesn't spoil the fact that I loved this movie.",positive

"Directed by Anthony Russo & Joe Russo. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Paul Rudd, Karen Gillan, Jeremy Renner, Josh Brolin, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Brie Larson, Zoe Saldana, Tessa Thompson, (voice) Bradley Cooper. (PG-13)Three hour payoff for the days-long superhero movie parade that came before (twenty-one releases total, but is anyone really grasping to, say, the second Thor movie for continuity?); it certainly opens better than ""Avengers: Infinity War"" by virtue of its start-off point--rather than dizzily jumping through several reckless storylines and dozens of characters right off the bat, it starts at an elegiac pace, re-establishing the few survivors and reflecting on the loss and ruin that has shattered so many of their lives. Then it's down to the effects-driven action business--fetch quests aplenty and a colossal final battle. Convoluted at times, unevenly paced throughout, and a bit heavy on the illogical fan service and curtain calls, it's still a movie destined to satisfy its target audience (as crowd-pleasing a crowd-pleaser as there has ever been). Assembly-line in nature, but crafted with more love and pathos than the average product, it may not be able to escape its status as ""blockbuster punctuation,"" but at least it provides a sense of closure that previous Marvel Cinematic Universe entries often lacked. The actors, from the major players to the cameos, all do solid work, far more grounded than one would expect from comic book cinema; for some, it will be their swan song, so it's nice to see them go out on top.69/100",positive
"This movie was phenomenal!!
I love majority of the scenes. I like what they did with Steve and Tony seeing each other again after so long, how the mourn with each other about the snap, and then Tony comes back around with everything that happened in Civil War, and that he doesn't want much to do with Cap. Then how we get to see that remaining Avengers, go into space, and how it's the first time for most of them. I like how go to retrieve the stones from Thanos once they've located when they are. But to there surprise, Thanos had destroyed them all, leaving the Avengers hopeless on being able to bring everyone whom have died from the snap. Then we fast forward into 2023, when Ant Man is released from the Quantum Realm, he finds out, that in just five hours of him being in there, five years went by and that a bunch of people had died. He runs to the house of his baby momma' s yo find out that his daughter Cassie, has grown to a teenager. He later on goes to New York to The Avengers compound, and talking to Steve and Natasha, and that's when we get the reveal of the main plot of the movie. Time travel! I love what they did with the Quantum Realm, and how they move through to go back into their pasts. Plus also Scott is now not the only Avenger to expierce the Quantum Realm. I like how Thanos is able to figure out that all of the Avengers came back from the future to retrieve all the stones, so he captures 2023 Nebula, and gets her Pym particles. We also get to revisit moments from past MCU movies, and it's a good way to give put nostalgia. It was sad to see Black Widow go, but it was a damn good and emotional way for her to go, for her to sacrifice herself, so she can finally get all the blood of her hands. Then we come to the final battle, it had such great moments in it, like Thanos destroying the Avengers compound, Cap finally lifting Thor's hammer, and we get something we all want to hear throughout all of the Avengers movie.... AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!! The final battle had such great action in it, along with Cap fighting his past self, but tte final battle is wherr most of the action is, we get Steve fighting off Thanos with mjolnir and his shield, we get the big fight between all the Avengers and Thanos' army. We have them pasting the new infinity gautlet like it's a football, so that way they can get it into the Quantum tunnel inside of Scott's van. Some great parts that I forgot is the reveal of Pepper's Rescue armor, Spidey finally using instant kill, and the great introduction for Captain Marvel into the final battle. We got to see Wanda get some one on one with Thanos, so she can get him after he killed vision. Towards the end of the battle we see Thanos almost winning again, but some of the Avengers come in to stop him, like Iron man, Cap and Thor. Thanos is able to beat them, but Carol comes in beating up Thanos, he throws her away and gets ready to snap his finger again but she comes back for more, than we see Thanos use the power Stone on her. Then we get to the saddest part, Tony's death. He takes the stones away from Thanos, and snaps his own fingers to get rid of Thanos and his army, and ultimately sacrifices his live, to save billions. I think it was a good way to off Iron man after RDJ leaves the role after his contract is up. It was such an emotional death, and we get the gift that Pepper made for him with his first arch reactor from the first Iron man movie, and the best reference we get us Morgan, Tony's daughter, to ask Happy for some cheeseburgers :'). And after that Cap goes back in time to put the stones back, and once he comes back, he's old and gives Falcon the Captain America role, we see later on that he finally got the life he wanted with Peggy. Some of the stuff I forgot to mention earlier is that we get the reveal of Morgan Stark, that Tony got to reunite with his father once he goes back to 1970, which during that time we see the original Ant man helmet, we get to see loki leave off with the teseract which sets off the loki series we're gonna get with Disney plus and that is also the reasoning for cap and Tony to go to 1970, Professor Hulk, and that Pete finally gets his hug from Tony. The things that I didn't like in the movie where the horrible game known as fortnite, that we didn't get a proper make up between Cap and Tony, we didn't get a rematch between the Hulk and Thanos, how it was unclear how 2014 nebula was able to go into the future, and was able to bring in Thanos' ship later on, and really didn't get to see what happened after all the characters returned.",positive
"After Infinity Wars, how Thanos could be destroyed given the odds is what I wondered from the time i left the theatre last year until May 16, this year. In endgame, Thanos is killed early and then we are off on a back to the future, terminator time loop plot. The thing about backward time travel if it were possible, is once you go back you would create another timeline and they are infinite mind you. In infinity Wars, Dr. Strange would have been sitting there forever until he found all the ways Thanos could be killed, and it wouldn't be just one either out of infinite timelines. I really wished they didn't have that kind of plot. If there are infinite timelines then there are also more than one timelines in which they win. So then what is so special about the current story line? Iron man dies? Well thats ok bc he exists in several other timelines. I couldn't get the multiple timeline part of it out of my head to care about this plot and the characters...a better and unexpected ending could have been Ghost Rider showed up in that timeline and ended thanos somehow for the atrocities he had committed or they could regain the stones to recreate the characters taken after antman subatomically enters thanos and blows him up. The plot could have been anything but a back in time plot..i tried to enjoy it..i tried to get into uncharacteristic Hulk and Thor but the back to future plot killed it for me...they could all die and they could all have figured it out on another timeline what's special about any one individual in this movie then?.movie is overrated big time. Avengers Infinity war was such a great movie imo and inspired many a mind to think how to defeat Thanos..but end game's plot is cliched and was a lazy way to end it all..it might be ok for younger folks but the multiple timeline plot makes it a heavily flawed movie. Acting was good, too much cgi, a few funny lines ..it was ok ..not a 10 remotely.",positive

"This movie tries to give so much to so many, and in my opinion succeeds on a scale we haven't encountered ever before in the mcu. You will laugh, you will cry, and hard-core fans will definitely feel shocked at times. There sure are surprises, that some will love and some will hate.
The Russo brothers made sure to change the pace considerably from what we are used to, since this film is about closures and farewells.
I'm also fully convinced they did their fanfiction and fanart research to please most viewers with certain outcomes, and ended up presenting us with one fulfilling, tear-jerking three hours long rollercoaster parting gift.
So go see this gift, and as we've been told in the trailers, enjoy the ride.",positive
"DAYUM. Great movie. Great story. Great actors. Great crews. I Love it. Great execution. The only thing that kept this from being a 10 is the corny all girl-super hero scene. As a father to two girls, I hope they have every opportunity in the world but come on folks. Keep politics out of movies. In a battlefield clearly the size of a state with everyone spread out, all of the sudden they all end up at the one place at one time when captain stronger-then-anything-in-the-universe Marvel shows up. BTW, I don't like the fact that superman is like that too. Anyway, its corny and the probably were 1 in quintillion.",positive

I love you 3000!",positive
"This movie felt totally different than the other 3 Avengers and it was because of its pace. The first half goes very slow but thankfully it picks up pace and takes you on a rollercoaster ride from thereon.This movie is not for someone who has watched bits and pieces of MCU movies, it's for the fans who've been involved. It's for the fans and only the ones who've seen it all will be able to relate it.There are multiple scenes which left viewers scratching their heads as there were some loopholes that needs to be cleared but irrespective of that it was worthwhile and enjoyable to watch.The finale fight against Thanos was beautiful and I can see that scene again and again as it was a delight to see your favourite Avengers on-screen again.",positive

"An American action adventure; A story about an ingenious inventor and scientist adrift in space with no food or water but his fellow superheroes, known as Avengers, must figure out a way to bring back their vanquished allies, and rescue the inventor, for an epic showdown with Thanos, an evil demigod who decimated Earth and the universe. This comic-book derived fantasy is the twenty-second film in the series of Marvel films and is a special effects-driven story and a direct follow up to ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and deals with themes such as loss, revenge, and the attempt to put right past wrongs. For viewers familiar with the previous films and characters, it provides exciting, entertaining action, witty humour and smart dialogue. But it lacks the exhilaration of ""Avengers Assemble"" and lacks the high point humour of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". By its second act it begins to feel predictable; it seeks gravitas but too many jokes destroy tension and suspense and there is a reliance on a time travel plot device which make a meal of the past, present, and future time continuum as narrative time. Thanos is the most interesting character, providing subtlety as the archvillain, and Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man is the fulcrum, as always, which is a boon because Thor gets bogged down in a belaboured comic routine and Hulk fails to deliver any of his trademark power.",positive
This movie is unarguably one of the best movies of all time.,positive
"Dissapointing and too long...Basically,only the ;last hour was watchable...
Previous entries were much better.",positive
I feel like wasted my time and money on infinity as everything was reversed through time machine. So you never know if endgame will also be reversed in next film through time machine. Further first 2 hours are soooooo boring that you can skip and join for last one hour to watch action vfx.,negative

Extraordinary movie. I can't say much as it was like I am in the movie.. that's it..😘,positive
"Avengers: endgame is not you're typical action sci fi movie , it is a culmination to 11 years worth of storytelling from the first Iron man movie, the depth in the performances by the actors reflects there character development in the past years with everyone getting the time to shine . The direction, the story and the VFX is something one can only fantasize about and the third act is way past ones imagination where all the characters under Marvel's humongous banner come into play and create epic moments. All in all Avengers endgame is an experience nobody should miss as it's a captivating end to what we have seen before",positive
"Movie is a little long. There are scenes that could have been made shorter or cut out completely.
A LOT of exposition. Feels like we're being spoon fed what they are planing to do the majority of the movie.
A cringe worthy feminist girl moment that makes your eyes roll. There was no subtlety there.
The movie was a little messy with pacing but show a lot of heart.There were two characters that I took a little issue with.
Captain Marvel- Irritating and nasty with the few lines she does have. Really felt Brie Larson bleeding through the character with comments like ""well, you didn't have me last time"". I feel no respect for this character or actress and hope they remove her sooner rather than later.Thor- Funny but the character seems to be dumbed down a little too much. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan and enjoy humor but this schtick went on a little too long.This movie has a lot of really solid comedy, heart felt moments, and action. Yeah it has some plot holes but the over all story is good and a fair way to end Phase 4.",positive
Love the direction Marvel is taking. Each movie getting better and better,positive
"I have been following the MCU since 2008 when I was 9 years old. I still remember the first time I watched the trailer for the first Iron Man movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and I BEGGED to my knees to my parents to go see it. After I left the theater with my dad I just remember never shutting up about it. I just adored it. 9-year-old me didn't know that Iron Man was just the beginning of something bigger that was to come.Over the last 11 years, we saw the release of 22 movies (Excluding Far From Home even though it is technically the last movie of this phase). 22 Marvel movies consisting of origin stories, trilogy's, crossovers, and more. Over hundreds of actors in a brilliant family-woven cast. Thousands of crew members and over 1000 minutes of screen time over the course of all the movies. Breaking box-office records everywhere. Each one told a new story that was unique, new, and fun. Even though there were a few misses here and there, you could always feel like the story was building to something new. Kevin Feige and the Russo brothers knew how much this 11 year journey was to people like me, and it really showed in this film.First, I'll get my negatives out first, because all MCU movies have some negatives. Some have more than others. I really despised what they did with Hulk and Thor. 'Fat-Thor' was funny at first, but then he became really insufferable to watch. Hulk was bizzare and they really didn't do right by his character. The Hulk I saw in 'The Avengers' wasn't here, and this interwoven Banner/Hulk didn't do it for me. I'd say the time travel plan sounded dumb at first, but Tony and Steve's time travel scenes were great to watch because it was nice seeing them revisit earlier established scenes. I think that Natasha's death was beautiful, but no funeral? She is one of the most deserving members of the team and deserves that honor. Also, I'm disappointed that they didn't really tie up Steve and Bucky's relationship. I don't have a problem with Steve going back to the past, living his life with Peggy, and giving his shield to Sam. But, they could've concluded Steve and Bucky's friendship arc way better, cause after all those two have been through together, you'd think we'd have a nice scene between them. Also, there were moments of complete and utter cringe in this movie. Like please, don't drag fortnite into this. That all woman shot in the final battle was very forced and cringy to watch. No problem with feminism in film or TV, but it shouldn't be too forced. And that is what it was. Rhodey was kinda awkwards and out of place in this movie. So was Captain Marvel. But that's it for the complaints.Alan Silvestri and his scores man. Music was spot on all the way throughout. I will never forget the iconic Avengers theme and the way it was incorporated was just...can someone give him an Oscar? Please.I'm gonna keep some of the scenes as my wallpaper because the cinematography was absolutely gorgeous. The most pleasing effect and settings I've seen in my life.Fan service is so much more satisfying to watch. For all the people who say fan service is a bad thing- In this context, it's amazing.Hilarious moments like 'America's a--"" (Thank god for Paul Rudd) and the Captain America ""Hail Hydra"" moment in the elevator (Russo's literally waved a middle finger to the comics, and it was beautiful and funny). Strangling baby Thanos. Ha! And the odd test aging of Scott Lang was great. Comedy was on point.Then came the satisfying parts. I love Natasha Romanoff so much. She is one of the best female characters in the MCU next to Scarlet Witch. So watching her sacrifice herself was very fulfilling to everything she has been built up to be. She sacrificed herself for the Avengers, which she considers family. That was the best way she could've possibly gone. Bummer she wasn't in the final fight, but it felt right. The fight between the Avengers trinity (Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America) and Thanos was divine. These 3 fighting off a mad titan like Thanos together was worth it. Seeing Cap wield Mjolnir was just satisfying to the T. Always knew he was worthy, this movie cemented it. Look, I waited a full decade to watch all of these stories, characters, and plot intertwine into one moment that I will never ever let go of. The moment all of our dusted heroes return, and Captain America with his shield and Mjolnir saying, ""Avengers......Assemble."" I just, I couldn't take it. I literally got out of my seat in the theater like everyone else and cheered my a-- off while holding off the tears. This movie was like a reward. A reward for the decade long investment. I am not ashamed to say I left the theater nearly weeping like a baby when Tony Stark died. This man literally started everything. He kickstarted this universe to the top. I hate to be that person, but Marvel has now definitivly crushed DC. Tony was one of my favorites, so watching him die felt like watching a part of me dying as well. It even hurt worse because the second they introduced his adorable daughter, I just knew in my heart that something bad happens to Tony. 10/10 best way to end his arc. Sacrificing himself for the good of humanity.That funeral scene was expertly shot, and whoever held the camera there deserves an award. And then, finally giving Cap the chance to have that dance with Peggy made me so happy. You don't know how much I wanted Cap and Peggy to have a reunion so they can finally have that dance that Cap promised her way back in his first movie. That was the best way you could've ended it.Even the end credits was nothing short of a masterpiece.I started nearly bawling when the original 6 avengers started signing off one by one in the credits. I am genuinely proud of this cast. All of them have risen to better things, and lord. When RDJ signed off, that was it for me and my theater. A standing ovation and the screen went black.This era of MCU movies is over. That 9 year old me is grateful to have been able to have experienced this journey. This incredible journey. I am looking forward to the future, but it won't feel the same without Iron Man and Captain America. But it's time for the new age of Avengers.To the cast and crew- I love you 3000!Final rating- 9.1/10",positive

Movie was fantastic! Sound effects excellent. Too many characters and not enough screen time. Was fantastic that they brought back people who were wiped out.

"I do not like marvel films, because forced comedy is not how you make films.
I liked infinity war because of thanks, a very decent villian.
When comes to endgame, it is a fraud, emotions without reasons and are they not the avengers, they avenge. Right!
I saw the trailer and thought this is gonna be a film where avengers are gonna shine. But all that suit up, training was for time travel to see their younger selves and parents.
An 8 year old will be able to write that outline.
By far the biggest disappointment by marvel, it has turned itself into the new transformers franchise. The only thing they are better at apart from the money is, paying off critics and websites to mislead by positive reviews.",negative

"I probably cried for at least the last hour of this film, literally. This film starts off VERY quick, throws you in right at the deep end. The next hour or so slows down quite a lot, not that it's a bad thing. It's a lot of character and world building. You also get the stuff where they do what they've got to do which kind of toom me out of it, I was like, is this how they're gonna do it? I thought there would be more to it? And then that last hour/hour and a half, it all comes together. It makes this film utterly perfect. I could have never possibly begin to dream up what had happened. The most epic battle you will ever see.
This is a very minor spoiler: Captain Marvel gets a haircut and I hate it, it's weird and there's no need for it.",positive
"I really enjoyed this film, how the time travel was a twist and how the film concluded etc.. However, my main issue with this film was the captain marvel aspect of it. The end credit scene for infinity war was of course nick fury reaching out to her before he turns to dust, showing that she would be crucial in endgame, and that she would play a major role in it, however she doesn't really do much in my opinion. I believe she only got around 15 minutes of screen time which makes no sense to me. Then they make her film which I know a lot of people didn't enjoy but I really liked it and it got me very hyped for endgame, so I was assuming we'd see her introduction to the avengers and other characters in endgame. In the end credit scene of captain marvel, where steve and natasha are talking about the pager that nick fury used to signal to captain marvel, and she appears and says ""where's nick??"" When I saw this I assumed this was a scene from endgame and then in endgame we'd see them being like ""oh who are you?"" and them explaining to each other who they are, what happened etc..
I thought we'd see much more interaction and interplay between her and the other characters, and them explaining the devastation that happened but they barely spoke to her. She should have been in the movie more, not as a main character or to steal the spotlight or anything like that, but I feel she could have been part of the time travelling scenes, she could have easily helped them and gone back in time with one of the teams. I just really did not like that she just appeared at the start of the movie, then disappears then returns at the end, and I did not like how they set her up as a powerful character in her own movie and then isn't in most of the film. I feel as if it was wasted potential.
Other little things that bothered me were why didn't nebula tell them the price of the soul stone, the hulk we know and love basically wasn't in it (or infinity war actually), time travelling confusion, pacing etc..
Other than the captain marvel issue and those little things, I enjoyed the film a lot, however I feel it could have been better and it had the potential to be a 10/10 film.",positive
"The only reason I'm giving 10/10 rating is because of the bond I have with these characters in the past 11 years. If this has been any other movie I'd probably given it 8/10.
Overall the movie was great, it was funny, emotional, and had action sequences. However, I personally think that the start was slow in terms of action and as compared to Infinity war.
Anyway it is a must watch movie for any individual but specially for a true marvel fan who has been following MCU during these 11 years!",positive
"I am a big MCU Fan, and watched each and every of them. Infinity Wars is 9/10, if not 10/10 ....Leaving the cinema, my immediate comparison was Skyfall v Spectre. I was also very disappointed about Spectre .... but this time, my feelings were more mixed.The good parts of the Endgame are many, of course, if you are a die hard MCU Fan. Eg, ""hail Hydra"", Peggy Carter, the jokes and fun (kind of resembling Regarnok but the latter is better), the recap of the different historical MCU movie scenes in the pretext of tracing the different stones. MCU Fans would love them, and so do I. It brings back a lot of fond memories I have had in the past 11 years and this is great for a finale.However, plot inconsistencies and illogical science aka time travel/Cap staying in the past etc just made me mad. The quantum realm can be better used to develop a much better, exciting plots without having too many inconsistencies and messes. The conversation between the Ancient One and Banner was so vague (ok, they can say that's a mix of science and myth and magic, fine ....) and if the Russo Brothers thought this can ""rationalise"" the whole inconsistent plots, they are undermining our intelligence. This is not an under 12 movie.The complete demolition of Hulk and Thor are disastrous. I guess they try to plot Thor into a funny and cartoon like character possibly to prepare for the GOTG3 ? But if not,, this is a complete disaster. Hulk doesn't get a revenge he deserves.There is a funeral for Iron Man, but how about Romanofff ? Romanoff also deserves some better treatment in the movie.Transponding Thanos' spacecraft from the past to the present is also totally unbelievable and defying logic. More elaboration as to what Nebula has done is needed. The past Gamora stocked in the future ? Are they really plotting for GOTG3 ??Another disappointing scene is Captain Marvel was beaten by Thanos without the stones - ok the last blast was because Thanos used the Power Stone, but otherwise it seems Thanos' power was too strong without the stones. This was not explained even at the Infinity War - as Thanos was already having the Power Stone (by destroying Xander) when they destroyed Thor and Loki at the opening scene. Last time at Titan the crew without Captain Marvel almost got Thanos (but for Star Lord), but this time with Thor and his new power, with Iron Man, Cap and Cap Marvel they were completely dismantled ! In the last fight scene which was quite messy (the opening was hilarious but that's all), Cap Marvel was blasted by the Power Stone but she's Cap Marvel .... since then she disappeared until the funeral ! That's why Iron Man was dead ....So many logic defying plots that I originally gave this 5/10 but the additional score was a compliment of a finale and an ending of an era. The movie nicely sums up what we have experienced in the last 11 years but I do expect something out of the box, something terrific, something more logical. MCU this time does not live up to my expectations !",positive
"Disney's grand attempt cash grab, trying to kill off characters while pandering to fan theories on who should live. Movie doesn't deserve a high rating because it is not theatrically complex. Time travel is a terrible cop-out for a real plot device.",negative
"This film is by far the greatest superhero film of all times..... it left you with a feeling of.......oh my god.....thanos fighting the three most powerful superheros of earth....it was so realistic and they show you why thanos was so invincible and i see why he can beat the hulk....there was no cartoonish strength .... it makes you wonder could he beat Odin or(HELA) his daughter.....the plot of all the marvel movies were ingenious ....thanos was so clever how he got the stones ...pt. 1 he didnt cross paths with no one he couldnt beat.... quill's father or Hela....he might have destroyed asgard to retrieve a stone but how would he have gotten to asgard....????????all in all this movie was pure entertainment....i have watched this movie about 10 times and i give it 10 stars.....equivalent to 100..... these guys with the low ratings cant convince the future movie goers that this movie is less than a realistic( 9.)...the only thing i hate is when they tried to push the GAY agenda....even cutting captain marvel hair and the strange relationship of her best friend...gay is a sexual choice that dont need to be publicized .....it is a terrible american agenda as well a blm movement and i am black.....but getting back to the movie the ending is so well played.....the first time i seen it with ""i am ironman"" i caught the vapors....so if yall get a chance look at this movie at least once a year with your family as well as rocky 2.",positive

I love you 3000.",positive
"Flawless. This movie is a love...no... An exquisite, poetic love letter to 11 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If Iron Man started this journey, Endgame bookended it flawlessly.
While many are going to say there is too much fan service in it. The referencing in the movie doesn't feel overdone when we are talking 11 years of backstory to reference. Unlike say The Force Awakens where you get borderline jarring references to the prior 3 movies.
Some may also say the first act of the movie is slow and boring, maybe even a slow burn. I call it kindling to kick off the fire that is the 2nd half of the movie. That first act sets up the results of Infinity War. It had to be done as it showed what happened to not only our heroes but the world. Its sets the stakes and prepares us for a heck of a ride in the last 2 hours of the movie.The ending of the movie. GAH. I can't say anything without giving something away. But it completed this saga in a perfect character arc.You look at the surface of this movie all you will see is a summer blockbuster action movie like everything else. You think about it in how it integrates with the other....what? 21 other movies? And you will see this movie completes a saga unlike any other movie that has come before.No movie has ever completed a 21 movie / 11 year story. This is the first, and this will be the gold standard going forward. People will be analyzing what Disney and Marvel have done between 2008 - 2019 for decades to come in classes. Both from a business sense and an artistic sense.I'll be blunt. I've NEVER blathered on about a film before like this. I'm not a Marvel fanboi. I like the movies. They are all good. Some better than others. Some are meh. Some elevate themselves above the rest. But Endgame? The Russo brothers have a fan for life in me. I will see any movie they put out going forward.",positive

"Tried to get into it, I was patient with the set up. But, for the most part, it's just another sequence after sequence of CGI action scenes without much substance. It's fun to see all the stars in the same film, but not enough to rescue this release with low art value and high commercial corporate fooder value.",positive

"The movie was easy to follow which is not true of all Avengers. It was very entertaining and it left me wanting more. In my opinion it's the best Avengers movie ever. However the movie is not without a flaw and what I'm about to say there's not a Viewpoint that the majority will agree. The flaw is the way they portray Hulk. The character is weak and a comic relief and that is not the Hulk that I grew up with. If there is one serious character that all superheroes are not so sure of and someone afraid of, it is the Hulk. This Avengers movie should have been about Park Redemption over Thanos. It could have been a showdown between two great champions,. It could have been a glimpse to show that the old Hulk is still there even though the more docile controllable and funny Hulk remains most of the time. That is the only knock I have on this movie.",positive
A film more concerned with making money and it's stars than characters or plot. No surprises and nothing new just lots of flash and really poor dialogue.,positive
This film was so poor I left feeling the whole MCU was less because of its existence. I now think twice before putting on any MCU film knowing that this is the Endgame.,negative

Gonna be honest. This has to be one of the best movies of all time. One thing I liked is that you have to have seen the other movies before this. Just to make sure you have your facts right. It brings you back to the first Iron Man. It is amazing. AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COST!!,positive
"Avengers: Endgame, is an epic ''heist'' but most notably a much greater sentimental and emotional movie than expected. Whilst the 3 hours runtime was noticeable at times due to a somewhat slow start, it builds a strong finale and a worthwhile send off.Late to the party, but only recently a random watch of GoTG 1 and 2 got me interested in filling the gaps and I decided to pickup the most important Marvel movies.Directing was just as strong as Infinity War. With Infinity war getting a slight edge. In general weighing this movie against IW I have to say IW worked just a bit better for me. There's something in me that keeps wanting to make the comparison to the original Star Wars trilogy. As for young kids, this might be their ''Star Wars''. But I'd then have to say I don't like how sentimental and depressing both movies get, and how it is filled with emotional moments. In a way it doesn't make me want to see these movies again versus SW which ends with celebration and a general happiness and festiveness. Whilst keeping small snippets of sentimental moments like force ghost old ben during the end of Return. The 2 Avengers movies just both end on a mostly sad note. And I think that is to the detriment of the series and it's longevity. Maybe that's why GoTG appeals to me and got me started watching these Marvel movies. It has a better balance imo of something that is meant to be a blockbuster.Now if I rewind and think about what happend in this movie, it has 1 highlight and that is the big final scene. Anything before that becomes a blur of talking and planning characters, reminiscing about the past. Nothing that really stuck around. IW had a better balance of things that happend. It's structure is memorable, in due part of the stones making ''chapters''. And that said, the final scene also felt like a repeat of the big scene in IW. So I guess I expected a bigger spectacle from endgame, but it kept it very much focused on characters and small moments. Which again, some people might like more, especially if you have gotten fatigued from the big battles scenes in all those movies that came before.Acting was strong as expected. Nothing felt out of place. Characters are solid as we know. Fair bit of focus on Captain America, I just don't really get the appeal of that character, he was alright.Music was great. Though I love the score, it starts really strong, and it's peak is fantastic, but it drops off fast. Which also played a part in the final battle scene with started so well, but they didn't keep up the pace. Compare that to scenes in LoTR or similar medieval epic battle scenes and they just work better for longer.It's a bitter sweet film that uses sentimentality to it's maximum, but leaning too much into bitter for my taste.",positive
It can't get any better than this. A perfect end to the story.,positive
"In addition to poor scenario, the film has a terrible comedy. The film is unnecessarily too long without having much to say.I have no idea why Hollywood has such a loose comedy. It's nothing more silly face mimics.The cinematography and video effects are eye-catching but I'm not impressed since we are in this era.",positive
"I thought the 3 hours went fast. It was generally a good movie but it wasn't fantastic. It was just good but with lots and lots of plot holes.1. Tony Stark becomes a time travel master in a short period of time with only ONE test iteration ran (which was successful). You folks do realise that Tony Stark had taken many test runs to even get his Iron Man core to work?2. Captain Marvel finding Ironman in space amidst a universe full of ""aliens"" that she needs to help probably sending out distress calls of their own.3. The absence of Loki after everyone comes back.4. How did Ironman snatch the infinity stones off Thanos?!!! You saw how much power was coming out of those things as the stones get sucked into his glove sockets. Even Quill holding 1 power stone (and remember, he is a semi/demi god?) caused a problem.5. With Pimm back, and with the knowledge stored in Stark's database, it means the MCU (and its bad guys who will do everything in their power to get hold of it) can now travel back and forth into time at will. Especially for Antman and the Wasp. This is opening Pandora's box for the future of MCU. Perhaps Pimm in his infinite wisdom will ensure this does not fall into the wrong hands?6. Dr Strange and the Ancient One see the infinity stones as critical in protecting the universe from the malevolent dark one which Strange fought in his movie. So when Thanos destroys the stones after his click, the world should not just be trying to get back to normal after 5 years. It should be destroyed.These are my top plot holes that keep gnawing at me. The movie was entertaining but the storyline chosen was full of flaws.",negative
"JUST AN AMAZING FILM AND STORY THAT HAD SUCH A BEAUTIFUL END TO SOME CHARACTER ARCS IN THIS SAGA! I was of course so sad when both Natasha and Tony died in this film because this characters mean a lot to a lot of people, including me. I sort of had an idea that Tony was going to die in this film, as it always felt in every film that he has been in that it was eventually he was going to end up dying but it was a beautiful end to his character arc and he will certainly be missed in future films and anytime he will be brought up in the world. I also had a horrible gut feeling that Natasha was going to die, and of course it did happen. I was so upset that she died because I really didn't want her to go and leave us like that, she was my favourite superhero and now she has gone. I am very excited for her solo film though, I know it's going to be amazing! Apart from all the sadness, it was an amazing film and story that really gave the Infinity Saga the ending it deserves. I can't wait for the future Marvel films that are yet to come😁",positive
"I wanted to give this movie a 10 but I just can't. The audience needed Hulk to smash one more time. We needed him to punch or kick or clap at Thanos just ONE TIME. That would have made the movie perfect. I didn't mind professor Hulk, but the fact that he never fights was a downer. Other than that this movie is amazing!!!! Comedy, action, drama, action, nostalgia, action, and yes it pulls at your heartstrings. Robert Downey Jr deserves an Oscar. Lets make it happen!!!",positive
Great movie. I wonder where such great heroes live who rescue humanity? In real world I couldn't find help to rescue myself from torture for last 15 years,positive
"I've heard and seen tons of people complain about why the movie is ""too long"" and had added ""unnecessary scenes"" I think it couldn't have got any better than that because those three hours fly right by because of it's incomprehensible level of top notch writing and entertainment. This by far is my favorite marvel movie of all time. It's got all the characters coming together for the spine chilling final battle. I'm considering buying the 4K version of this movie to maximize the entertainment as it is well worth it! I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. 10/10",positive

"There are no spoilers in my review. I enjoyed the movie. It did a good job of tying everything together. The fight scenes and special effects were great, it's a fun movie! This movie is definitely filled with a lot of familiar faces. Some folks who aren't with us anymore, so it's bittersweet to see them. I would definitely watch this movie again. Watch closely because it foretells of some things to come. I like when movies drop little nuggets like this. It gives you something to look forward to. I also like that the storyline is continuous, it makes the movies easy to follow and pick up where you left off.",positive
"The greatness of Endgame comes in the ways it both builds on and pays homage to the many films that have come before it. Truthfully, I find it extremely similar to Infinity War as a movie, but with the core of the film being acceptance of events and moving forwards, rather than the conflicting ideologies and resulting battles of Infinity War. Both are most impressive in their ability to allow an enormous ensemble cast to breathe and never feel rushed or overstuffed, focusing on a few character's arcs and getting the audience invested in them. Endgame also continued to have excellent visual and sound effects, with some stunning action scenes that brilliantly balanced and mixed the strong score with immersive sound effects. The humor was effective and I found the use of homages and self-awareness in referencing past Marvel events or movie tropes (primarily the unrealistic time travel portrayal in movies) to be stronger than the traditional one-liners you find in movies like Ragnarok or Guardians. The plot itself was coherent and reasonable, relying on a fun and plausible ""time heist"", but I found it a bit anticlimactic after the challenging planning that it was so easy as to be almost an afterthought that they secured all the infinity stones (a task that should be monumental). I had my usual qualms with the action scenes, as character's powers or effectivity of specific moves don't seem consistent throughout the fights, but they were fun to watch as characters tried new tactics and it was not just a rehashing of the action we saw in Infinity War. Iron Man and Captain America's character arcs are both satisfying and appropriate for who their characters are and what their goals were. I did find the way Hulk was scripted to be bizarre and frustrating, as he was a character who had struggled to balance the duality of his nature in helping others with uncontrollable rage, and here he felt like a goofy, meandering character lacking well-defined characteristics or audience investment. Thor also had a plausible general story in blaming himself and struggling, but I thought it was played out to an absurd and over the top degree that's not realistic given his character. Still, I have no overarching qualms and felt the movie was handled thoughtfully and emotionally, feeling like the true culmination and crowning achievement that the MCU has built up to. It's satisfying and well done, but I don't think it's a better overall movie than movies like Infinity War or even Black Panther or Winter Soldier just because it's the finale that was done in that satisfying way rather than a more specific or intermediary story. I'm excited to see it shatter some records at the box office and see if it has a chance at a Best Picture nomination - unlikely but definitely possible. A great ending to a great series of films.",positive
"To be honest, I got emotional seeing this movie on the big screen. Each actor delivered an outstanding performance and really contributed to the ending of the Avengers saga.",positive
"If Infinity War was Back to the Future 1, Endgame is its 2nd and 3rd part.
We get the same battle in a different time, previous scenes from previous movies, same scenes with different outcomes and a lot of satisfactory conclusions for the characters.
It's not the same streamlined adventure the first movie was, but this will go down as the biggest obstacle our heroes ever overcame and that's what you will remember in time.",positive
"Oh dear. Where to start? Infinity War was pretty decent, but something went seriously wrong with Endgame. It's an absolute shambles; a mess of a finale with some of the most destructive ""character development"" and storytelling I've ever seen. It's a painfully awkward and half-baked ending to the phenomenon that has been the MCU, and the people behind it should be ashamed.For starters, the story is a train-wreck. After killing Thanos in the first few minutes (and learning he destroyed the infinity stones, so no take-backs on the snap), we get a time-skip of five years where we see a conveniently placed rodent step on a piece of Hank Pym's equipment, releasing Ant Man. Realizing that only five hours passed for him while he was stuck in the quantum realm, he and the remaining Avengers (who have all become, sad, washed-up, and maladjusted, barring Iron-Man) go on a self-congratulatory jaunt through Marvel's greatest hits, shredding various timelines with reckless abandon in an attempt to get the stones back and undo the snap. However, a younger Thanos discovers what is happening and hitches a ride to the future so he can be killed again. Iron Man dies, and Chris Evans goes back to put the stones back in their proper timelines, and stays in the past with his girl-friend, aging into a creeper of an old man before giving his shield to Falcon.As lame as all that sounds, it's much worse to see unfold on screen. The time-travel is wildly inconsistent, especially when you consider they name-checked as many time-travel films as possible and claimed their versions of time-travel were all garbage! They claim that going back in time creates a new timeline, yet Chris Evans manages to go back and stay in ours. No explanation of how this works is given. Additionally, the characters are all written horribly. They focus primarily on the original six avengers, but ruin all but one of them. Chris Evans is not playing Captain America anymore, at least as far as I can tell. His portrayal here is nothing like it was in prior films. Thor is reduced to a flabby drunk for laughs, and a pathetically hammy Mark Ruffalo has somehow managed to reconcile the two halves of his increasingly annoying character off-screen. Great writing there. Black Widow dies in exactly the same way Gamora did in the previous film, even down to the music, and Hawkeye is suddenly an emo vigilante. The only character whose arc is handled well is Iron Man, who gets a family and a rather good send-off. As for the remaining Avengers, they are all shoved off to the side and ignored. Okoye is barely in the film, which I find absurd. As the primary surviving Wakandan character, she deserved more screen time, especially since she featured prominently on the film's promotional materials. The Guardians of the Galaxy are all handled disgracefully, and nothing interesting is done with anyone else. As for the action, it's not anything special, particularly not the muddy, washed-out final battle with more plot-contrivances than a children's cartoon.All in all, this is a criminally bad film. Disney proves yet again that it doesn't seem to know how to satisfactorily wrap up character arcs and stories, creating a bloated, self-congratulatory film that's light on logic and laden with nonsense. It's a crying shame that things went as badly here as they did. It gets 3 stars for Iron-Man, and that's about it.",negative
"To start off, this movie is beyond perfect and incredible. The longevity seems troubling at first, but I can promise that they used every second of those three hours beautifully. When you thought 22 movies would have given the audience enough character development, then treated us to plenty more fulfilling story lines that guided us through the way to the end. Going on that note, if you haven't seen all of the movies, if you aren't a true fan, and if you're just going to this movie for the action, why waste your time? It will still be an incredible ride, but in order to get the best experience possible, you have to have that emotional connection and dedication. This movie will make it worth it all.
Before seeing the movie, I was introduced to a few possible spoilers that ended up being true. Even if I knew for a fact that they were true, nothing can prepare you for the gut wrenching and beautiful moments that were captured.
I absolutely recommend everyone to go through the marvel experience and see how these 11 years leaded up to one of the most amazing movie franchises in history.",positive

"While most of the movie was amazing, I have one bad criticism for it, which has knocked it down a point. The 'girl power' scene at the point where Spider Man says to Captain Marvel 'I don't know how you're going to get through all of that.' And she's joined by every possible female character. The scene was completely forced. They might as well have waved a flag and yelled, ""Look, girls are fighting in this battle! Yay girl power!"" It totally broke the third wall, reminded me I was watching a movie, and brought politics into something I went to watch for fun. There's no need to point out that there are indeed girls fighting in the battle. If they're strong role models we'll remember they're there. If not, how does this help further the story-line? Marvel is known and loved for its strong female leads. It doesn't need to be pointed out that they're awesome, we know it. Look at Electra, Jessica Jones, Medusa, The Phoenix, Rogue. All amazing characters, it doesn't matter what gender they are. There it is, the problem I have with this scene was that it was about 'girl power'. It undermined what the rest of the movie was about. The story wasn't about whether or not the people fighting were males or females, it was about good people doing what's right, against all odds. Except for those few moments the film, where it was more about 'strong women' than 'good people' fighting to save humanity.
Here's a quote for you: ""Any man who must say 'I am the king' is no true king at all."" ~Lord Tywin Lannister GOT. I get the quotes about men but let's put it this way. Any woman who has to tell the world 'I'm a strong female role model.' is no true role model at all."" If you need to force the message in our face that your female leads are strong, then they were never really that strong to begin with. Don't pander to the audience to try to push an agenda, stay true to the message of the original story. Your strong role models won't need special scenes just for them to make sure everyone knows who they are, it will be made evident through their actions and characters. It doesn't matter if a person is male or female, what makes them a good role model has nothing to do with gender. 'Hero's are made by the path they choose, not the powers they are graced with.'
The rest of the movie was amazing, even though they ended up with a Captain America from an alternate reality- he couldn't have gone back to their past, because by doing what they did they changed the past, splitting the time line and creating an alternate reality, which Captain America would have ended up in if he went back to the past. Yay, theoretical physics! Anyway, special effects, acting, puns, the entire rest of the movie was totally up to par. Amazing! A beautifully crafted film, aside from that one little blemish, it was a job well done.",positive
Watching Endgame I was so excited for it I was like a kid at Christmas. 2 hours and a half later I woke up and we were at the end of the film watching the final battle.Long winded.. but full of those little moments that make it all worth it making into an all time great. Ground breaking visuals and a great finisher for the franchise.,positive
"A satisfactory finale to ""Avengers: Infinity war"", which surprised me, as I scored the earlier film a 4/10 on this site.Why the improvement? Well, even though I hadn't kept up with the other films in this franchise (i.e. the Marvel Cinematic Universe) before seeing ""Avengers: Endgame"" (which was no different to how I saw ""Avengers: Infinity war"", this time I didn't feel as though I was missing important information or events from those MCU films which I hadn't seen. So, even though I hadn't seen the current ""Captain Marvel"" film and she appears in this film, there just didn't seem to be anything that I was missing by not having seen that other film. That wasn't the case so much with the Ant-Man character, but I wasn't really bothered by not getting the payoff which I presume was intended from him.Since this is the finale to a sequence of MCU films, I won't bother outlining the story so far...you should at least have seen the previous Avengers films in order to be contemplating watching the finale. So, I'll just note some things which struck me, watching this film...it may, therefore, be more interesting to people who have already seen this film.General observations:* Whilst the film was generally satisfying, I doubt that it would stand up well to repeated viewings, as it isn't particularly briskly paced or action-packed (not that these are necessarily bad things, especially given how boring Hollywood films can be when they go down that route).* I wasn't a fan of the treatment of Thor in this film. Even though I've never read a Thor comic, or watched further than the first film of his own franchise, I have to say that the humour revolving around him didn't work for me. He comes across as a plummy sounding Englishman who watches way too much LA based teen comedies or something. Some of the humour was conceptual, though...in the way that Monty Python can be conceptual...your head recognises the joke but you just don't laugh. I didn't mind his pun near the end of the film though, concerning another MCU franchise. I am curious whether Chris Hemsworth went ""method"" for this role though, or whether CGI was used instead.* Another big problem with the film is that it just lacks storytelling smarts, as far as the action sequences go, although that flaw is pretty much endemic to every action film ever made. The second Lord Of The Rings film, I think, conquered that common failing, in that the war scenes displayed military strategy and tactics in a dramatic and engrossing way...but perhaps that had more to do with the nature of the military technology utilised in that story? To paraphrase this point, I'm saying that you don't really get scenes where you feel that your favourite Avenger is kicking goals, so to speak (and as I don't feel particularly invested in any of the characters, this didn't bug me so much). You don't even feel as though they are in mortal danger. All you get is countless thousands of CGI fighters engaged in battle, as is Hollywood's wont. There was a missed opportunity to create drama in those set pieces. For instance, much drama could have been made of Ant-Man's abilities and how they could avert a catastrophic loss of lives amongst the forces of good. You really don't get much on that front though...you see a little bit of tactics but no drama there, whatsoever.* Connoisseurs of time travel stories might enjoy the proceedings of this film, as there is much meta-discussion about the merits of the logic of other time travel stories known to popular culture. For all I know, the theory of time travel espoused in this film might be as absurd or incomprehensible as that of any of the films that the characters in ""Avengers: Endgame"" critique. The discussion is interesting nonetheless and I may try to find the script for this film in order to become more familiar with the ideas presented in it.* CGI plays a big part in this film, as I've already mentioned with regard to the battle scenes. It also plays a part on a more intimate level. For instance, I recognised John Slattery as the actor playing one of the characters in the film. He seemed too young though for it it to be him. I'm not sure whether CGI was used for him (maybe they just used conventional special effects?)...or whether John has discovered a new facial cream with wonderfully restorative properties for his skin. Speaking of John...his character has possibly the most bizarre handshaking technique ever represented on film. It also seems to me that Robert Redford got an even bigger CGI treatment for this film than Slattery did.* I doubt that anything at all hinges on a comment that one character made in this film, but it sounds like it should...""We deal with it by not dealing with it"". I'd be interested to know if the relevant MCU franchise (""The Black Panther"") will revisit this comment.* The comment about Doctor Strange ""giving away"" one of the Infinity Stones intrigued me. If that was in the previous Avengers film, I've forgotten about it. Maybe I should remind myself of the circumstances of that event? In any case, I'm not sure that this film sheds light on why he might have done that. Or did I miss something?* Since this instalment of the ""Avengers"" franchise serves as a bookend, I wonder whether I can be tempted back to the MCU sometime, given that the MCU is very hit-and-miss, and mostly misses, it seems to me. If I can't, then not a bad way to end this fling with Marvel.* Curious about any lore concerning who may wield Thor's hammer.",positive
"It would an understatement to call this motion picture ""an adequate film"". It is quite the amazing film. The plot really is a home run, and the ending battle with the titan Thanos is amazing. The ending was sad(no spoilers). Definitely reserve time, your favorite snack foods, and days to watch this incredible film.",positive
"I usually hesitate to use words declarative words as best or worst. So this offering by Marvel is somewhere in between the best movie I've ever seen and the worst movie I've ever watched. This being said Endgame felt like the poem ""Casey at the bat"". All full of potential only to strike out.",positive
"First of all infinity war was much better and the only reason this made it to the top is that it's like a kids film the fightings are so childish, it doesn't have the vibe that marvel comics give you and as you know this movie has the most sells only why? Because they released this movie twice second time they said they added ten minutes and the ten minutes was mostly the credits cheap strategy but it worked on MARVEL FANBOYS.",negative
"I'm not a big Marvel fan. I have said many time that Marvel movies are just above average pop corn flicks that make a lot of money. Making a lot of money does not mean its a great movie.This was the first Marvel Movie that I actually enjoyed. There were however some annoying plot holes that I can't get around.The Power inconsistency, Storm Breaker Thor put an axe in the chest of IG Thanos in IW, but in EG Thanos without the IG beats Thor very badly.(Professor) Hulk does literally nothing!The stupidity of the scene, when Tony finds a new way to power himself in Iron Man 2, pales in comparision to Tony figuring out time travel.Captain America picks up Mjolnir, like really?Did Nebula forget to tell Curt and Natasha that the soul stone requires a sacrifice?Natasha and Curt fighting each other over who gets to sacrifice themselvesHow Thanos mananged to figure out how to come forward in timeThe time travel was way too easyIf returing the stones to where they came from resets the reality, then surely returning the Soul Stone should bring back Natasha?",positive
"I would like to assure all readers that I will not be including any spoilers from Avengers: Endgame. This film, according to me, is the finest comic book adaptation I have seen in the form of a movie. This humanised so many heroes that we are used to seeing fight Godly beings. Regardless of the long 182 minutes runtime, the pacing of this film is impeccable. Never does this film seem convoluted or exhaustingly long. However, a note for the non-Marvel viewers contemplating watching this film - this may be difficult to follow if you have not seen most of the previous films, at least the sequences in the middle of the film. For the fans, this really does pay off the 10 years of commitment you have exhibited and shown. Having seen the events of 21 films coalesce here is a privilege for me. I loved every moment and part of the film to the core.",positive

One word to describe it : BEAUTIFUL. No superhero movie like this. Ever. Never write a review before in my entire life. But this one is an exception. The MCU Project has never been this ambitious before. Crazzzyyyy,positive
Thor has evolved as a much funnier character when we saw the glimpses in ragnarok and finally in endgame he is the only one making you laugh amid emotions and tears and ofcourse banner too brings smile to your face... Outstanding finale.. Although this movie might have pulled final curtains on some characters but for some existing it promises a exciting new beginning.. The slate is clean.. Its upto to you marvel to create another epic saga,positive
"Avengers: Endgame, directed once again by the Russo Brothers, was one of the most memorable films I've ever seen, being the best movie theater experience I've ever had! The Russo Brothers gathered everyone together, one last time, to go out with an absolute bang, but it didn't come without a few flaws. The premise of the film had it's tropes, but due to the great amount of heart, powerful themes, emotion and tention, it kept things moving forward, with great energy! Although there are so many memorable scenes, all of the content they tried to squeeze in, set up for a lot of plot gaps, conveniences, and nitpicks, but nothing completely threw me out of the film. Similar to Infinity War, the way the Russo Brothers structured the scenes, didn't make for the best flowing narrative, creating too much filler, in order to hit that three hour mark. They tried to incorporate almost everything that we've learned in the past, creating a lot of fan service moments, throwing the pace and focus of the film off. The Russo Brothers seemed to have had a tough time trying to balance all of the tones, where at some moments, they play off eachother nicely, and some other times, it can almost take you out of the film.It's crazy that, after twenty-two films, the creative team is still finding ways to flesh out, and develop our characters! Even though there are a few questionable character archs given to some of our heroes, you still have to give credit to the creative team, for doing something new, while still keeping the comics relevant. There are so many great character moments in this film, and I'd honestly go as far as saying that, it had just as many, if not, a few more moments than Infinity War. Markus and McFeely did a great job grounding everyone's character, giving everyone a well understood motive, that the audience can create an emotional bond with. This was by far the most emotional film of the Infinity Saga, but, by every character bringing their A-game to the set, it brings the emotions up to an eleven. One of the main issues I had with the characters, on the side of some of the archs, is the balancing. As said before, it's going to be tough to balance all of this talent on screen at once, but they created a better situation for themselves, and didn't quite capitalize on it.Given for the amount of content they had to put into form, the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, was pretty good. They created a lot of memorable pieces of dialogue, while balancing the comedy better this time around. The only issues I had with the script, was some ideas and characters went a little underdeveloped; other than that, this was a pretty well written script.The action of this film was off the walls! Though it can get a little sloppy, and convenient at times, they still managed to craft these amazing, high octane action sequences, including the most memorable and known sequence of all superhero films!Overall, there are more than a few notable issues with this film, but I just really enjoy Avengers: Endgame! I wouldn't go as far as saying that it belongs at the top of your list, but it definitely belongs around the top ten!",positive
"Overall is a very good film,i feel sad about black window die, also iron man died,",positive
"One of the reviews says audiences were crying, well I was too for different reasons. I guess this is the future of cinema. Cliche after cliche, characters who begin and end the movie the same (the only arc would have been a magic one with sparkly bits on it), there was magnificent CGI and a Pegasus, who I thought was Greek, not Norse, myth. But three hours to tell it all in. Spare me the numbness. However, everyone made lots of money and they will spin off the franchise for as many times as you can travel through time. The actors had more fun making it than I did watching it, like some bad live music I've been to, so I can handle it. Tk goodness there is not another ... or is there?",positive
"This movie is average. Worth a seeing, but that's it!!So many things are wrong, I don't even know were to starttimeline concept is really stupidTo much Hawkeye and totally o.pHulk has become a sissy, and won't really fightThor has become a fat drunk, but a fun comedian.Hawkeye can wield an infinity stone with his bare hands...wtf??!This is more a slapstick comedy, with drunk jokes, Fortnite jokes and other stupid jokes, than it is an epic conclusion to the Avengers / MCU, and with only around 20 min of action in total, the movie is wayyyyyy to long.End battle was so stupid, that many in the theater began to laugh and 'buuhhhh'. Was that really it? Was that what we've been waiting so long for?!
Dr Strange was just standing around doing nothing else than play with water.
Hulk didn't get to fight Thanos. Would have been awesome endbattle, so he could get revenge from Infinity Wars!
Several other things was stupid too, but I've almost already forgot the movie.Seems like the producers ran out of ideas, how to het the stones back from Thanos, so in the end, even though he hasn't fully working armor, Tony Stark just sissy-slap Thanos, and then suddenly he has the stones?!So many powerful charaters, and it could have been an epic battle..but then it end like this!!I was disapointed, but still...it's a Marvel movie, so it deserve a 7/10 😀",negative
"I think that this film gets a good ending for the infinity stone's saga.
The battles, the great amount of characters and the plot itself are the bests to end this saga and continue with a new saga of the MCU.",positive
"I really loved movie , but if the actors change i won't follow such as many other serials who left behind and doesn't worth to follow. specially Robert and Chris, I've spent hours and made connection and don't wanna make such a thing again.",positive

"This movie make me laugh ,clap and cry , make me happy make me sad
this one gave every actor a space to really act well specially Hawkeye
I don't want to spoil so I just want to say
Thanks to every one in cast for giving us this piece of art.",positive
"Between the hype , expectations and the facts .. i can -with a clear consciousness - call this an extremely overrated movie ..",positive
"The Russo brothers deserve the praise heaped on them for this achievement-it is a deeply satisfying end to this phase of the MCU. Not only were the action sequences thrilling but there a fluid and vaguely plausible storyline even if some parts were a little predictable at times. There was good humour, impeccable CGI and a great pace- despite being the longest of the Marvel movies I wondered where the time went. I cried at the loss of some of my favourite characters and was touched by the story developments occurring in parallel with the Thanos/infinity stone story arc such as Steve Rogers finally choosing to prioritise his own needs, the grief and guilt dominating the Black Widow or the deep sense of loss felt by Thor and the impact of family and sacrifice on Tony Stark. It is a reflection of how well these characters are developed that we feel such a sense of loss now that it is all over. My only criticism is that it had to end at all.I know we can't have the Avengers back, but hopefully Thor's torso will return to its former glory in time for Guardians 3. There is hope.",positive
"Over 20 films and over 10 years leading up to this, the wait is finally over, all the questions have been answered.......sort of. Go to be honest even though, I am personally not a fan of the MCU or any other comic book films these days, I was in awe of what I was watching in certain moments. However this film is a bit of a rollercoaster to say the least, there is a lot to process so forgive me if I forget something.Just like with ""Infinity War"" the Russo Brothers deserve a lot of praise for the directing and story telling in this film. It has everything you could want from a film like this and especially if your a die hard fan of the franchise. Action packed, solid story, emotional punch but most importantly damn entertaining. Amazing from there standpoint what an achievement..........wonder what they will do next??As I have preluded to I am not a fan of the MCU or of the genre anymore, about 8-10 years ago I was a die hard fan but now couldn't care less........become less and less interesting. I am a victim of over saturation of comic book films. Therefore I probably in the minority when I say that this film has many positives and more importantly negatives as well. These are just my personal favourite moments or moments I hated......yes hated!!!PositivesThe cast throughout is fantastic across the board in what they are given to do, Im not gonna list them all go google them yourself. However there are a couple of standout performances and story lines/moments that were really breathtaking. Chris Evans just knocked it out of the park.....well he has done since 2011 but its even more impressive in this film. Just spectacular, has some fantastic scenes throughout showing a huge range in the character we've grown to love and route for. His ending is fantastic I couldn't have thought of a better way for Steve Rogers to exit the MCU just perfection.The other two standout performances are Paul Rudd and Brie Larson, again just own the screen when they are on it. Ant-Man is strange character for me because I thought his solo films were ok but not much more, felt he was much better suited in a team up film. That feeling is even more justified in this film, the character was used perfectly and Paul Rudd was fantastic, made his story interesting and pulled it in new directions. On the other hand I was really shocked in how much I liked Captain Marvel early in the year, but man did nothing prepare me for her film stealing performance. Its only a couple of moments here and there but wow just wow.NegativesSorry the fun is over, no film is perfect there are quite a few problems with this film, I almost ended up not like the film because of them. Firstly and the biggest elephant in the room...Thor/MCU Humour. What on earth were the Russo's thinking, from a character standpoint this is the only thing they got wrong......and they got it badly wrong. Its is so cringeworthy I cant bare to think... for me it just doesn't work. Its another example of the that dreaded MCU humour that I simply don't find funny, its not the first MCU film and it won't be the last with this problem.....over reliance on humour.The other two big problems are the pacing and the runtime of the film. Firstly the pacing is all over the place, for 1/3 of the film is slowly paced, which I have no problem, but its 180 degrees opposite of rest of the film. The last 1/3 is just going at hyper-speed. Secondly at just over 3 hours it is far to long.......even if your a die hard fan you must have been looking at your watch at some point. Could have trimmed it down just 15-20 minutes.....could have helped with the pacing.Overall its 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10......Yeah I know I didn't give it a 10/10 whats your with me. If it wasn't for Chris Evans and Cap's story line/ending along with Paul Rudd's and Brie Larson's performances and the fantastic ending...I would have really struggled to even give this film a 7/10. The dreaded MCU humour especially with Thor was so off putting, along with the dodgy pacing and 3 hour runtime almost got me worried. All in all ""Infinity War"" might be the overall better made film but for shock, emotion and entertainment ""Endgame"" certainly delivers.P.S. Also the special effects in the film are just magical, award winning maybe??Also what they gonna do now with no Stark, Rogers or Black Widow????",positive
"Avengers:Endgame ,a movies hyped for over 2 years finally came to the cinemas and the audience after leaving the show were just left numb. This movie is a perfect conclusion to a 21 film long story-telling and though it was a difficult task for the team,Russo brothers just pulled it off with style.Leaving no ends loose,this movie made us experience every human emotion.It made us laugh,sad,made us cheer ,feel for the characters and finally weep for them.No doubt this is one of the best superhero movies in the past decade.",positive
"The movie started out good but as soon as they involved time travel i was done. When you think about it time travel beats every power and character out there. You can literally do anything and change any destiny. Im not even gonna go to metaphysics side of this, where you could go back and change everything one person did so whats the hell and heaven for now?? So basically time travel is a logic killer for movies and should be avoided or directors should keep it low key. Im not even excited to see next avengers against galactus or any character in that matter bcuz they can simply time travel and try again",positive
"Sry, but this isn't a 8,7 rating movie.
I get that it's all doom and gloom with what happened in the last movie, but u don't drag that out for 2 hours.
Main acts becomes sideshows, story is a mess.
Put in a bit of woke and u release it.
I will not rewatch this.",negative
"An amazing movie, emotional, funny and with so much action! One of my favourite movies! It is worth watching! You have to see it!",positive
"SPOILERS
So, 22 films. 11 years. When I walked out of IW I didn't know how marvel was gonna top this movie. But they did. Goddamnit such a beautiful film. Love it a 3000",positive
"I didn't care for Infinity War. I rated it a 4 and gave it a pretty critical review. So I was very hesitant about seeing Endgame but I'm very glad I did. It's possibly my favorite Marvel movie. Infinity War felt very cold to me as far as emotional connection to the characters but Endgame was completely the opposite. Some people have criticized the lack of action but in my opinion that's exactly what it needed. The galaxy had suffered a major blow from Thanos and it was intensely interesting exploring all the emotional reaction to that trauma. This is what good science fiction does. It explores the possibilities and stretches the mind. I haven't read comic books since I was a teenager in the 90's but that was one of my favorite things about comic books. That there were so many possibilities for the imagination to explore. And you could enjoy it on a monthly basis rather than waiting years for a movie to come out. Anyways, Endgame started to tap into that style for me. I did not mind their comical treatment of Thor. Many people forget that these characters come from comic books and a lot of times the comics don't take themselves very seriously. Chris Hemsworth pulled it off very well. As far as the criticism of the Hulk, I didn't mind that at all since I was used to Peter David's much more intelligent treatment of the Hulk. The movie was full of moments that gave me goosebumps and excitement. The pacing was very irregular and confusing which added to the suspense of the film since it was so disorienting. Doing things by the numbers just gets so boring after awhile. And there were multiple amazing ""endings"" but the final one with Cap and Margaret was just perfect. I could go on...there were many many great scenes and interactions with characters throughout the movie. The final battle scene was exhilarating. It felt in the vein of the final battle scene in Return of the Jedi. I can't say very many bad things about it. Only that it is a real shame that the X-Men weren't there. Also Bucky totally should have been Cap's successor. That was a wrong move in my opinion. I was hoping for a cameo by Agent Coulson but alas no. And good riddance to Scarlett Johansen. Black Widow is great but she was miscast in my opinion.",positive
"Once you start watching this movie you do not want to stop. This is just not a movie it is much more than that. One picture says more than 1000 words , so go and see this amazing movie!",positive
"Full of surprises
I really enjoyed it
Perfect endingGoodbye ""avengers"" and thank you",positive
"This was a phenomenol and perfectly executed picture to wrap up a final conclusion to a deserving saga. I could honestly not be anymore happier with the outcomes of this film. It was thoroughly well-scripted throughout the movie with acheiveing to seperate the humour, action and emotions equally. The Russo Brothers nailed the directing and the actors and actresses executed their roles outstandingly. Visuals were cunning all the way. Character developments and sadly send-offs were perfectly done. But most importantly it had its unforgettable moments which stood out and ended this masterpiece.",positive
"""Avengers: endgame"" was supposed to become The great final of the biggest series of Marvel films containing all the main characters.What it really is what we see? I wouldn't name it The great film. Yes, the cast is good and well-known and the picture is fine and beautiful, but it didn't become that great as it supposed to be. The storyline wasn't that different from other films and the end was not such a surprise. So, go and watch it, probably for you it would be The great final.",positive
"Been waiting for so long for the ending of the saga and now i'm really satisfied with it. Honestly i've been scared it will be a mediocre ending or even worse. But after i watch it, it is really great. For me, it's the greatest ending that has ever been made. It concludes everything in the infinity war and also the journey of the original six cast. It's also perfectly make the transition to the all the mcu character successor. I think no more review so i dont spoil anything. If you enjoy watching mcu movies, you're gonna love it.",positive
"I'm not a big fan of superhero films.. I've enjoyed a few but I'm no fanboy. Seeing men in tights with big letters on their chests just doesn't do it for me. But I do like Batman Begins as an example of some guy in tights still been a good film.. I like gritty and a little dark my super heros. I liked some of the X-Men franchise. (I,II, Future Past..) These were sometimes intelligent and interesting. Sadly to me the whole Avengers franchise has felt like a dumbed down version of the X-Men films.. It's basically a lot of ego centric stereotypes wise cracking at each other and showing off. Sadly that's what I got from watching this. The first hour was terrible. Spoilers potentially! It gets better in the second half for a while. The actors show some emotion! Wow.. some years are shed. The wooden acting still shines through however.. I mean I'm surprised at the high ratings for this film. It seems like everyone a just forgiven the huge plot holes, poor acting and unnatural script writing and ultra predictable stereotypes .. and everything that's bland and wrong with this film... Because... It cost a boat load of money? Has a lot of secrecy around the ending(s)? I actually stopped watching with about 30 mins left.. after the big battle where everyone is thrown together to fight off this guy who by that time we don't even care what happens to him anymore anyway.. it's all just a big mess if you ask me. I really don't get it. So many plot holes and WTF moments? It's just all so wooden.. Like Guardians of the Galaxy but less funny, fun or relatable. The CGI was disappointing. The hulk character had no life in him.. and neither did the actors sadly. Half of the planets population is wiped out by.",positive

I hope they help you when deciding what to watch and what to avoid.",positive
"Even though I don't mind superhero movies, I still watch them from time to time. In particular, I looked at The Avengers. Infinity War"", which, as you remember, ended sadly: ""ours"" lost, Thanos won, a good two-thirds of humanity was destroyed. I note that the ""Avengers"" will not be able to watch in the background, since there will be no interest at all.And here is the final part, which I also had to watch. Of the heroes I know, there are almost none left, except for the raccoon and the superhero played by Downey. From the last film, there was such an impression about superheroes: boastful, overly self-confident, but sympathetic. So in this movie, at the very beginning, we are shown a new supergirl from space, who tells the surviving heroes that they are all suckers, and that they lost the battle due to the fact that she was not there. In general, as always, ambition and arrogance, like everyone else who has already died in peace.",positive
"Every moment in this movie just makes you surprised, laughed, cried and in the end, it still brings to a close of an Era of MCU FILMS. Truly a Marvel movie indeed. P.S The best yet and will probably gonna watch the second time",positive
This is the movie of my life and the best eger.nothing can come to this level of emotions.Seeing cap tony and all the avengers face to face.Its the best.In fact i dont think there will ever be a movie like this again.This is not just a movie its something you live with.This is the best movie of all time,positive
I would have to say this movie ended really well. I was very pleased on what they did with the original avengers from the first movie. And with all the characters they brought together it added some intense and amazing action sequences. But overall i was very satisfied with it.,positive
"This is an amazing film. I love almost every aspect of this film. As a Marvel fan, I can definitely say that Avengers: Endgame is a love letter to the fans and provides a satisfying emotional conclusion. Let's get some negatives out of the way. Everything up until the Time Heist drags on and starts to get boring. I know that they need to set everything up for the 2nd and 3rd acts of the film but I wish they had done it better. The 2nd and 3rd acts of this film make up for this though. I also didn't like the explanation for the their time travel. The film basically states that anything the characters do in the past doesn't affect the future which makes no sense at all. I know that this is their own rule but it just makes no sense at all. Why would changing the past not affect the future at all. That would mean that Nebula would have disappeared when she killed her past self. The one other problem is that some of the jokes didn't work. The positives far outweigh the negatives though. The cast does an outstanding job especially all of the main Avengers. I loved watching them together with War Machine, Nebula, and Rocket. All the supporting characters also did an amazing job. The plot can get confusing sometimes but generally, it's understandable. The tone remains consistent throughout the film. It's sometimes funny when it needs to be funny and it's serious when it needs to be serious. The cinematography was fine. It wasn't anything special. The visual effects for this film are amazing though. The armies look mostly real and Thanos looks great as always. There is a lot of emotional weight to this film which kinda surprised me. I was expecting Hawkeye to die but I was generally surprised and sad when they killed off Black Widow. I was really sad when they killed Iron Man. I knew they were but I didn't know how they would kill him. It was incredibly satisfying to hear Iron Man say ""I am Iron Man"" one last time. His death is sad but satisfying. The funeral scene at the end of the film was so awesome and brought back some characters we haven't seen for a long time. The action in this film is probably the best in the MCU. The climactic battle at the end is in my opinion the best action scene in all of cinema. Captain America wielding Mjolnir was so awesome to watch. Personally, I loved the ending for Captain America. He got to live the life he never lived. Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a satisfying conclusion to the first 22 films in the MCU while boosting a very strong cast, some amazing action, and an immensely satisfying conclusion. I give Avengers: Endgame a 9.5/10.",positive
"First of all, This isn't a perfect film. It has it's flaws. But it was an extremely enjoyable and action packed film, a perfect ending to the MCU (for now at least). After captain marvel, i was apprehensive that marvel would over use her. But thankfully she was sparingly used, and even those scenes were pathetically put together. Thankfully there were very minimal wakanda & black panther segments. The comedy was on point, so were the emotional scenes. A huge let down was what they did to Thor, it was atrocious. The action sequences were amazingly executed. The scenes with Thanos were amazing with some of the best movie quotes ever. Iron man's story arc concluded beautifully. Hope marvel does not retcon these events in the future. Don't miss this. It's worth watching on the big screen.",positive
"This huge amounts of charecters made the main story something you lose yourself within it and dont know whats going on really
in the infinity war they gave some logic to the idea of evil side of the story but again in this part they show it as something just want to destroy with its primitive ideas
its realy unfair to compare this one time seen movie to batman. joker the movie one can see many times and still be enjoyed as you was seening it for the first time",positive
"So the Avengers attempt to redress the wrongs of Infinity War. The try to head Thanos off at the pass with a nifty piece of time travel thanks to the return of Antman from the Quantum Realm. It seems to take an age to get that point and then it becomes very messy. It doesn't really get much better. The finale battle is a re-run of the battle of Wakanda with some missing fighters showing up this time.
There are some nice touches, but it's a real drag. Anyone hoping that this would be Captain Marvel's show will be disappointed.",negative
"Anyone who complains about this film has not appreciated the last 10+ years of Marvel cinematic creation. Apparently everyone is a ""genius"" and those that have been working on these movies for this long are idiots. This was the best and most perfect way to end the Infinity War Saga. They blew everything out of the water and delivered exactly what fans needed and wished for. Those that apparently have been writing movies from their couches fo their entire lives while sipping on mama's kool aid need to check themselves. What blows my mind more than the movie is the fact that there are actually people griping about it and finding every reason to whine and moan about something that you never could dictate - so why bother wasting so much time? It was good. It may end up being the highest grossing film of all time. That says enough.",positive
"What a conclusion! We couldn't ask for more, and it completely exceeded my expectations, on a movie that concluded a story that involved 22 movies. That mission alone was difficult, but the Russo Brothers knew how to work from that and fabricated a movie that besides from concluding the story, it completed the previous chapters!
Thrilling, heart breaking, amazing... It lack's words to describe it!",positive
All bias aside this movie is incredible and will change your life if you let it. 100% every question is answered and you will feel emotions that will shake you to the core. Incredibly well done and was truly a spiritual experience I mean that,positive
"This movie deserves all the praise it got, for the epic finale of original crew it delivers. The CGI and acting were masterfully integrated, sync and complement each other, rather than try to composite for lack one or another.The movie stays true to it's constructed formula, that gradually built up since first Marvel movie. And with it all the puns, setting, and it's own original concepts that differ from comics a lot.The highlight of the movies though, are very moving individual moments and scenes, that will melt even a stone heart. And some very unorthodox actions moments, that I cannot mention here, because it would be a spoiler. Speaking of that, I still can't come to conclusion if I should be amazed or in shock, of how crazy that looked like.Reason why I gave this movie 9 and not max rating, is because of pacing. In some parts. it felt a bit off, but it picked up very quickly and from that moment on, the screen will have your undivided attention, I can guarantee you that.",positive
"I see why the critics like it. It's about love, loss, epic battles, second chances and the triumph of good over a great evil. Not of course, without a great sacrifice. Epic.",positive
"The Russo brothers have handled their films impeccably and seemingly had an impossible task on their hands. That is do justice to every single superhero in the shared universe. I gave this film 9 stars even though the first two acts seemed uneven and predictable. As Thanos said, it was ""inevitable"" that they should all face off again. Because of this it was hard to get terribly invested when you know they may lose some key members along the way but in the end they will succeed in getting another shot and Thanos and his army. To be fair this could be said about most every superhero movie ever.This brings me to the final act and it is perfect. One of the absolute best, if not the best, battle scene of all time. CGI and character balance was flawless. Cap and Ironman leave their roles with the integrity they entered them with. I cant say enough good things about how everything was wrapped up.",positive
"I personally believe 2019's ""Avengers: Endgame"" is unduly revered. The movie is definitely a grandiose phenomenon and a monumental crossover of comics superheroes unlike ever precedented in live-action. But that doesn't mean that it's story structure is weaved strong, because it certainly is broken and a muddled mess in areas; I'll mention some aspects soon. And surely box office success does not denote that a movie is a product of quality, so anyone using that as an argument is ridiculous. Consider the financial profit of fast-food chains that are a detriment to health. People are sometimes easy; flash the lights on a hawker, crowds will be enticed into the carnival tent. Or Moths to a flame, if you prefer that analogy instead.Before my criticism, one must undoubtedly admit the climactic final act of ""Avengers: Endgame"" is unequaled by any movie in the superhero genre. When the resurrected allied heroes burst forth from a sky spattered array of magic portals to confront an epic battle, it was an exhilarating and gratifying culmination of over ten years of build. It was overflowing with tension and audience eagerness; sensing that as I watched it in the theatre. It's an undeniable thing. Unfortunately though, the movie's runtime is a purposelessly long, frustratingly boring, and uneventful slog to get there. Irritating. So much time wasted. And there were so many plot elements that were stupid and faulty. To save length, I will list some glaring ones:Hawkeye brought a baseball mitt back through the time portal, so that obviously means the Avengers could have brought back through innumerable vials of Pym particles to not have a finite supply for time travel. At least enough to not be worried of making any mistakes.Killing Thanos near the opening of the movie, also dissolved the characterization of Thanos for the climactic third act. There was no emotional satisfaction of Thanos when defeated. Why? Because the Thanos of the past has no relationship to the Avengers or awareness of what he did to them or who they are, so the confrontation and retribution of the protagonists to the antagonist is emotionally hollowed. The tension plug was pulled. The characters have then no interrelation to each other anymore and their arcs are not entwined to the same emotionally meaningful degree as before. In other words, when Thanos was decapitated early, that too killed his character and reverted him to a state of a bland villain mentally unaware to the story's contextual conflict.Black Widow and Hawkeye brawling in contest to obtain the soul stone was incredibly senseless. Sacrificing something you love was established as the stipulation to obtain the stone - so brawling to kill theirselves would not earn the stone for the other because suicide is self-inflicted! Hawkeye only earned the stone because he released Black Widow's arm to fall to her death, so the whole contest of suicide was pointless. The emotional tension attempted to be made in the scene is not that; it's ridiculous.Past Nebula during a scene robotically connects and manipulates the time portal machine to conjure past Thanos through the portal. What!? Then the Avengers allied version of Nebula could've bypassed the need for Pym particles and the whole plot dilemma and procurement of Pym particles was a colossal waste of time! Why have it in the plot then?Those are the most glaring that come to my mind, but there's plenty more. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a mess. And the convoluted concept of narrative timelines and time-travel in general of such stories muddle any possibility of the movie making sense; there will always be questions and alternative decisions thought of by the audience. It's just backing oneself into a corner really. This movie is not deserving of the reverence it's received; the stuff I mentioned is obvious and indisputable. Aside from the culminating epic third act ensemble battle of characters, there's no merit to this movie. Please read the multi-issue comic book series this movie was derived from; it's far superior with its storytelling, has better content this movie cut, and has a broader cast of Marvel characters and concepts not limited by what is and isn't in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",positive
All around amazing. A beautiful ending that felt not only like a proper wrap up to everything we have seen in the MCU so far but also opened so many doors for the future. This will be at the top (at least top 3) of everyone's marvel movie rankings.,positive
"After the defeat by Thanos (Josh Brolin) -in the 2018 Infinity Wars - who used the Infinity Stones to wipe out trillions of the world's population, the Avengers come together to put things (people) back in the world and in doing so they realize some sacrifices must be made. Oh, Oh!This movie is a good 3-hours long. The first hour could have been cut to 10-minutes as the music was dreary, the Avengers dialogues were slow, dreary and almost defeatist, and they weren't sure how to get the people back and this went on for too long a time. Too long a time. Then Scott/Ant (Paul Rudd) says they must go back in Time to a time before Thanos gets the stones. And that is how they plan to do it.The rest of the movie has the Avengers going after the stones, then overly long CGI battles take over, but to be fair here you will see many of your celebs.The Avengers: Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man/Tony Stark; Chris Evans as Captain America/Steve Rogers; Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk; Chris Hemsworth as Thor; Scarlett Johansson as Natasha/ Black Widow; Jeremy Renner as Clint/Hawkeye; Don Cheadle as James/War Machine; Paul Rudd as Scott/Ant Man; Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange; Chadwich Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther; Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel; and Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.Notables: Rene Russo as Frigga; Tom Hiddleston as Loki; Dave Bautista as Drax; Tilda Swenton as The Ancient One; Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan; Natali Portman as Jane; Marisa Tomei as Aunt May; Michael Douglas as Hank Pym; Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne; William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Secy of State; James D'Arcy as Jarvis; Vin Diesel as voice of Groot; Bradley Cooper as voice of Rocket; Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, wife of Tony Stark; Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star Lord; Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury only seen in one of the last scenes; Anthony Mackie as Sam/Falcon; Karen Gillan as Nebula; John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tony Stark's father; and Stan Lee as Stan Lee, a driver. There were more, but I don't know of everyone. Maybe you do. Have at it.Best line: No amount of money ever bought a second of time. Next best: Ant: ""Somebody peed In my pants. Don't know if it was baby me or old me."" This happened when they were experimenting going back in time. Funny.Here is a movie you can enjoy in 3-ways: The spectacular CGI, all the celebrities, and the endings (""they"" go on for a while) and you will like.....maybe. Not sure I like the idea of a talking Fox. Is this put in for the kids? (Believe he is from another planet)A couple times we did hear some catchy toe-tapping music. Could have used more.Didn't understand all the hype with this movie. Way too long, but then, they needed to get all the celebs in. That first dreary hour was a killer, not good. Production wise all was very good. (7/10)Violence: Yes.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: At times, could have used more.
Language: One GDI, and several Sh_ _ words
Rating: B",positive
"It was a fairly entertaining film for the first couple of hours (probably worth a 6 or 7), with a few exceptions, - not least the abomination of making Thor a fat drunken slob.
Then it slowly became apparent that this was all about shedding the old traditional heroes (as originally written) and replacing them with politically correct versions as per the recent trend.
I'm sure it will appeal to enough millennials to make tons of money, but I suspect that this is where I get off.
If the PC brigade want ethnic minority and female heroes, - why not create new ones instead of corrupting the original stories.
Until they add a White (or Black) Widower, male Captain Marvel (as per the original stories) or a white panther, etc., for balance.
Which, I'm guessing, is no time soon.",negative

"Had to make an account to write this, but yes this is worth a 10. Mainly on the hype train to keep this brilliant film as highly rated as possible.",positive
"To avoid any more suggestion of spoilers, I'll say this - the cast, cinematography, story - it's all well done. And if this is the last Marvel ever made, it would be the most fitting and perfect of endings. It does have a few minor flaws in its story, but with so many moving parts in this three hour epic (that is shockingly self-contained), you can forgive it for its awesomeness.",positive
"No spoilers here!I'll keep it short and sweet, it's a solid film and I enjoyed it, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Would I reccomend you go and see it? Of course! You should just keep your expectations within reason.",positive
"It's been a week since Avengers : EndGame hit movie theatres. Since then, I've been trying to wrap my mind around the idea that it is really over.. This week saw EndGame breaking long-held records and creating new ones. It has made 1 billion and over $900 million worldwide!
Almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been already said. Like so many others; nevertheless, I was and am profoundly emotional. I've always studied catharsis yet for the first time, I lived it. EndGame showed me the true meaning of catharsis; it purged me. It was beyond what I expected and I expected phenomenal! It was an experience like no other, a masterpiece. I laughed, cried, cheered and cried some more.. I was a complete emotional wreck towards the end. I was a ten-year old boy again. It took me to a journey which I've been part of. I was nostalgic. I saw myself in every piece of it. The movie was a capsule of memories..
This is history, the world came together to witness an end of an Era. All shapes, ages, sizes, colors, religions and genders. It was a national event! Marvel showed us how movies should be made.
I've loved Lord of the Rings, I've loved Harry Potter, I've loved Star Wars. But I have LIVED the MCU. We can never be thankful enough for what you've given us. From a small kid who watched Iron-Man in 2008 with zero expectations to the man who watched EndGame three times after a week of its premiere!
It was not easy for Marvel to start the MCU. Marvel had to sell some of their rights to other studios in hope to start the MCU. Things didn't go quite as planned. Therefore, Marvel gambled its rights to all of their characters to get a loan of $500 million to start the #MCU. It was a risk worth taking. A well-earned success; not only for Marvel but also for the fans, myself included.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you Marvel, thank you StanLee, Russo brothers, Kevin Fiege, writers, producers and actors. Thank you, Robert Downey Jr. the one who started the game and the one who finished it. He created one hell of a legacy. I never want it to end, but ""Part of the journey is the end."" I am really grateful for being part of that journey. I love you 3000",positive
"It's taken eleven years and twenty-two films, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally reached its long-awaited bittersweet conclusion.Thanos has snapped his fingers and half of all life on Earth is gone. With the few remaining heroes left, the Avengers embark on a revenge quest against the villain that has stolen their friends and loved ones. But just like all plans, this one doesn't go right and the team must now band together for one final showdown in order save the universe and set things right once and for all.*Forewarning, this review may a bit shallow at times and free of specific details for the sake of not wanting to give away spoilers. So please give me the benefit of the doubt as I try to be careful with my words.After now four outings, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo have firmly planted their position as the MCU's best directors.Whether it be during somber conversations between characters or in the Lord of the Rings style final battle, the amount of detail and effort that goes into each frame is unparalleled by any other blockbuster.Regular Marvel cinematographer Trent Opaloch's compositional lighting and camera movement is simply outstanding and keeps the film running on all cylinders throughout its three-hour runtime.Also keeping the energy high is the lightning pace that brothers infuse into the film's second and third act. They may miss the mark a bit during the first hour, but they more than makeup for it in the latter two thirds as they deliver some of the most entertaining material put to screen.Lastly, aiding the brothers is a sweeping score by the always underappreciated Alan Silvestri. His music is swiftly able to go from epic to intimate in the blink of an eye and is a key driver behind many of overwhelming emotions felt.Co-written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, ""Avengers: Endgame"" may mark the first film in the franchise to look back in the past as opposed to solely setting up the future.The specific medium it uses to reminisce may not be the most logical or neat, but the end product is a string of touching moments that pleasantly rewards fans that have stuck around all these years.After some time away from each other during Phase Three, the main core of the Avengers is finally back together, albeit under less than ideal circumstances. This initial tighter cast allows the main troupe to get their time to shine in what could be a few send-off performances.Things do start to get messy when the entire roster is put back together. Some characters get the shorter end of the stick in terms of screentime, but I don't know how it could all be properly done unless this movie was another six hours longer (which I would still approve of).Marvel films have been built since day one on their ability to blend comedy with high emotional stakes. The stakes have never been higher here, and the same can go for the number of quippy jokes. The quality of the humor is surprisingly high throughout, but the sheer amount of one-liners during what should be tense moments verges on borderline overkill.With its bafflingly long cast list, ""Endgame"" boasts quite a few key acting highlights.The co-leads of Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans shine brighter than they ever have before. They've gotten better with each performance and leave it all on the screen as they share immense chemistry with each other and everyone around them.Josh Brolin is still great as Thanos. While he doesn't reach the high bar he set for himself in Infinity War, he still delivers another powerful performance that towers over all the other Marvel villains.Both Karen Gillan and Paul Rudd surprisingly stand out as Nebula and Ant-Man, respectively. They each have a more grounded personal story that offers a stark contrast to the epic main narrative.I realize I'm leaving a lot of great performances on the cutting room floor, but it would take a novel to talk about them all. Basically, everyone either did well or just alright. Nobody was outright bad.Arguably the biggest pop culture moment of all time, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a film that arrived with an infinite amount of expectations and meets each and every one of them.Within its 181-minute runtime, you'll laugh, you'll more than likely cry (I did), and most importantly, be amazed at how a legendary neverending franchise can reach such a satisfying conclusion that both respects the past and gives confidence for the future.",positive
"Part of the Journey is the End. An absolute triumph of cinema. The perfect conclusion, and undeniably the most emotional MCU film to date. I cried from start to finish. You can have The Godfather, Titanic, The Shawshank Redemption, or any of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but to me this is the greatest movie of all time and I will never concede that it is not. Something like this will never be accomplished so perfectly tragic and beautiful at such a grand scale ever again. It's a momentous achievement in cinema, and I fear it will be taken for granted when it's all said and done.",positive
"Story was decent, albeit a bit predictable. CGI was cumbersome, but I expected it to be so I dealt with it. There were some really good poignant scenes made this movie watchable to me. The bad was there were your typical action movie cliches that after hearing the audience guffawing and cheering over them, I have come to to peace with the cliches will live on forever. What I found interesting was that there are some unanswered questions that make me think that this is not actually an endgame, but what do I know? They were pretty damn significant to just leave out.Bottom line it was a fun movie to see with the family and it was definitely something to see on the big screen.",positive
"The length of the movie increased with long talks, which makes almost no contribution to the plot or highlight heroes characters. Instead of Marvel usual excitement feeling (although I am not big fan of comics) you get the feeling was it worth to spend 3h.
If the movie would be brutally cut to 1.5 it would be good end product by Marvel.",negative
I can't think of a movie that covers the scope of End Game.,positive
"In a world where power means greed and the ability to destroy as opposed to protect and build. In a world where we tend to categorize and create tension as opposed to finding common good. Why shouldn't we believe in super heroes and the ability to overcome evil through seeking common good, unity and sacrifice. Script was excellent, performance was mind blowing ...Marvel Magic hit home! Everyone was clapping 👏🏼 Standing ovation as the credits rolled I can watch this over and over and over again!!!!! Mind blowing!!!!!!",positive
"Best film of th world, best film of the marvel. Is a very good film with a story very good to",positive
"The set up was excellent. Made sense that it took a long time for the team to reassemble and figure out the plan. Liked the recluse Iron Man. Like infinity war it's frustrating that you see a favourite character but they don't really have a role. Within this I liked that they emphasised black panther. It was odd that captain marvel took so long to appear but I understand why, it's game over for the bad guys from there. It made sense that the only way to hurt her was with one of the stones. Then iron man won through cleverness. Not a big fan on the cap am ending, a bit overboard. Loved the fight sequences with Thanos. Interesting to see how powerful without gauntlet. Can't wait to see it again.",positive
Infinity War was much better. I did not like the ending at all. Can't wait for Star Wars.,positive
"After 11 years and 22 films in the making, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become one of the ballsiest experiments ever taken in cinematic history, and one that has captured entire generations. Perhaps the most anticipated blockbuster since Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avengers: Endgame marks the culmination of the first 3 phases of this forever running series, wrapping up multiple storylines and character arcs in the process.After the shocking and devastating events of 2018's Infinity War, the original Avengers are left stranded on Earth with no clear path of their futures. The mad titan Thanos wiped out 50% of the population and the world has become something of an apocalyptic wasteland. They can either move forward and live different lives or find a way to bring back what was once present.The second of a two-part finale is shaped over a 3 hour and 1-minute runtime, and the result is a roller coaster ride unlike anything Marvel has ever done before. If Infinity War was the ultimate fan film, Endgame is a different beast. Its predecessor was an ensemble piece, a simple good-vs-evil plot populated with multiple characters while blending humour and character motivations to spectacular effect. This is more like an old fashioned epic, channelling ambition, scope, and storytelling as dense as films from Lawrence of Arabia to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.Screenwriters Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely and directors Joe and Anthony Russo work hard to focus on the right elements of the storyline, without disastrously going off the rails. The script is mostly absorbed with the past, creating not just a sense of nostalgia and poignancy, but overall a unique viewpoint on the past 22 films. It makes you realise how far these characters have come, which feels satisfying. Even if the action and special effects are, for the most part, impressive, the film's strong point is the character focus, which was the perfect direction to take.There are a few stumbles along the way. The pacing can be bumpy across 3 hours, especially when expositional scenes frequently overstay their welcome. You cannot help but feel overwhelmed at times due to the overstuffed amount of story, which can make action scenes feel less satisfying than they should. But for a finale as monumental as this film, not everything can work. There are more stories to tell, but there is no doubt that anything following on will come close to matching the brilliance of Endgame.Finally, this is a Marvel film that demands repeated viewings. Mark my words!",positive
Why they didn't include more fighting? 3 hours is too long to a story without a lot ot action scenes in a Superhero's movie,positive
This is one of those rare movies that it seems pointless to write a review because its so good. In fact its so good finding something to criticize here will only make you look petty.,positive
"I'll keep it short. The acting is pretty good, where the characters are allowed to be in shot for more than a few seconds. No-one is allowed to dominate and it feels the directors emphasised the strengths of the protagonists. The strong one, the honest one, the kind one, the damaged on.As others pointed out the plot was preposterous but made up for by great subplots.The effects were huge and fortunately not quite as confusing as Transformers.",positive
"I was so excited before and so let down afterwards.While Infinity War was better paced and presented Thanos's goal and how he worked to achive it having some philosophy behind, here we are greeted with alot of self pity and ""he hit us, we must kill him"" plot. That's all there is, no deeper meaning. We could also call them Revengers from now on.Unfortunately very quickly in Endgame the revenge mechanism appeared. The oh-so-convenient time travel. Quantum everything and there you go, Endgame solved. Add to that the overall ""our chosen good guys must win"" obvious direction and the suspense or thrill for the movie vanished instantly.Cutting a long story short:
Fat Thor was funnyBannerulk looked like an aged man trying to blend his passions with the responsabilitiesNebula should have changed her cloud password :)Disliked Captain Marvel's haircutAlternate timelines selflishly affected in order to achive their revenge. How did they patch the Soul stone or the Tessaract that fell in Loki's hands?!Let's say Captain America got from barely moving Mlornir to easily swinging it because he became more worthy but the lightning thing?! Wasn't Thor the god of lightning not the god of hammers As Odin told him?!. Therefore the lightning was channeled from Thor through Mlornir not from the hammer itself.Fighting power greatly inconsistentFat Thor got so weak with Stormbreaker AND Mlornir to barely fight NG (No Gauntlet) Thanos?!How did NG Thanos expect to attack all heroes at once and let only Nebula look for the stones?!How could Gauntlet Thanos be so weak with the glove on?! I mean he could exit through a portal, get at full strenght and then return to smash them all over again - that's an easy plot hole.Too much plot armor overall for all superheroesThe continuous juggle with the gauntlet that went on and off so easyThanos reduced from a clever driven villan to a generic average bad guyAnyways, that's my impression of the movie.
Not sure I will rewatch it like I did so many times with Infinity War.
Maybe the other 14M alternate futures got a better story.Over and out.Edit: Lowered the score, changed title and added 2 lines to be more accurate. Reality is often disappointing.",negative
I'll keep it simple. I'd find it very difficult to score less than 10. Mammoth effort in filmmaking. I almost want MCU to call time because anything else will surely be an anticlimax.,positive
"Overall a great experience and wrap up to a fantastic franchise.
But I still feel like something was a little off or missing. I realize not every expectation can be met. Anyone agree?
Maybe it was the way Thor, Cap and Iron Man never really have a moment at the end of the movie. As the main three.
They all kinda seem to have their own agendas. Thor wanders off into space, Cap goes back to the past and Tony gives his life.
I mean come on, not a single word exchanged between Cap and Tony at the end?I guess I was looking for them to have a different send off.But overall was a great cinematic experience.",positive

"This is a spoiler free review of Avengers: Endgame. There is a special place in hell for those major outlets that spoiled gigantic plot details that Marvel hid in the advertising. #DontSpoilTheEndgame #ThanosDemandsYourSilenceTo say Avengers: Endgame had to meet lofty heights is an understatement.Endgame is the culmination of the largest cinematic universe ever conceived and one that changed how Hollywood does movies.Endgame exceeds even the best of expectations.The Russo Brothers have cemented themselves that the true masters of superhero films. These directors have perfected the formula; a beautiful balance of characters, heart, action, drama, and passion. I don't think anyone else could have made a film like Endgame without it falling apart under the weight of all the pieces stacked on top of each other.The climactic tale of Endgame is relatively simple for a 3-hour behemoth. Following the events of Avengers: Infinity War, where the Mad Titan Thanos killed half of all life in the universe, the surviving Avengers do everything they can to reverse Thanos' climactic snap. What follows is a 3 hour love letter to the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and one that sees some storylines end and leads to new possibilities in others. To say more is to spoil part of the surprise of the film.Endgame was filmed back-to-back with Infinity War and it's clear to me that Endgame is where the emotional heart of the Infinity Saga is was placed. There are many moments in this film that will bring you to tears. Moments that any fan of the MCU will cheer for. Moments that no other franchise could ever hope to attain.This is probably the most emotionally vulnerable we've seen many of the heroes of the MCU. We see what it's like for our heroes that helped define a generation to have failed despite everything they tried. There's a sense of sadness and desperation throughout Endgame that no MCU film has ever maintained for so long. This is not to say that Endgame is a sad movie; Endgame is a very adult movie and is one that any fan of the MCU will need to see.Endgame is a roller coaster of a movie in so many ways. There are moments of levity, moments of fist-pumping action, and then moments of complete sadness that might bring tears to your eyes. It delivers everything. It never flinches. It will affect you in every way a well-made film can.Performances are across the board fantastic. Thanos still reigns as the best MCU villain and Brolin's performance as man/monster who has the absolute conviction to do what he sees as necessary and the power to achieve it is beyond terrifying. Due to the increased run-time and Thanos' actions in Infinity War we get to spend a lot more time with our core Avengers group and have those moments that Infinity War lacked. While some of the supporting characters don't get as much time to shine, Endgame is really about the emotional turmoil of the original Avengers and how they deal with a world where they lost. This is where the heart of Endgame is and what makes Endgame not just another superhero team-up film. Endgame is a deeply personal story. These are actors doing right by the characters they portray, and doing right by the fans that adore them for it.Oh and of course the action is fantastic and on a scale that may never be topped. While Infinity War might have been more action-packed by nature of it being a, well, war film, Endgame is more focused on the character moments that lead up to the climax that we all have waited a decade to see. The sheer spectacle that is the final act of Endgame is worth the price of admission alone. So many moments in the final act will have any MCU fan screaming on the inside with joyous ovation that will make them hardly be able to contain themselves. I am not kidding when I say this: the dude next to me at the theatre was literally bouncing up and down throughout the climax.Perhaps the only slight I have against Endgame is that it's a film that would be next to impossible to fully appreciate for anyone who hasn't seen the entirety of the MCU. There are moments in this film that reference pretty much every single MCU movie made. Most references are quiet ones to some of the more iconic scenes in previous MCU films; the more drawn out ones are fully explained in the film to let newcomers follow along. Endgame is best appreciated by the die-hard Marvel fans, but is still approachable for those who have only caught their more popular films.I could go on and on about why Endgame is excellent but I must resist the urge to as it might spoil the surprises. Endgame is truly a unique film experience; an epic follow-up to Infinity War that finishes what that movie started, as well as acts as a nigh-perfect ending to over a decade's worth of cinema. While the MCU will continue with heroes new and old, Endgame is the point where we will look back at as a monument to the right way to end a story on a scale which previously was never even dreamed of.Avengers: Endgame is the rare film that will make you cheer at the top of your lungs and make you cry just a few moments later. A film that has laughs while also having deeply reflective and somber scenes. Avengers: Endgame is a thrilling, heartfelt, and fitting climax that is almost impossible not to love.",positive
For me this was the perfect ending to a long journey in the MCU. I have ready a few reviews and I get some of the reactions. But the emotional roller coaster was just what I needed. It was hard to say good bye to certain characters but Plenty of doors were left open as we move into phase 4. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did. I won't post much more than this so I don't ruin the movie for anyone.,positive
"So here we were all excited about how the marvel saga was going to end.
Avengers infinity war came out and was actually pretty good considering the burden it was bearing, so our expectations were notably raised for Endgame in a way that I personally did not expect it to come through.
So after a rather long and excruciating wait it came out.
Upon release I saw the reviews going on and on about how good it was. It even held a 9.4 rating for a while which made me think maybe it actually lived up to the hype.
But boy was I wrong.Honestly the best they could come up with was time travel?! Time travel?!
The last thing you do is take a story bound in a reasonable alternate universe and suddenly give it a push into the realm of science fiction.Although I must admit it wasn't bad if we overlook this major mess up, hence I gave it a 7, but it certainly isn't worthy of all the acclaim it has received.",positive
"This movie justified the journey one made from 2008 to 2019.. A satisfying end to the infinity saga.. Epic in every proportion..
From a humorous and dramatic 1st half to an insane, thrilling and heart wrenching 2nd half and climax.. kudos to Russo brothers for that..
This proves to be a great farewell for many characters in MCU.. let's see how the Marvel universe built itself from here on..",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is just what I wanted from a finale to such a long series. It's not nearly as good as Infinity War, but it didn't need to be. It's practically just 3 hours of corniness and one-liners, and I'm not asking for more. The movie is nicely paced, and while it didn't break any boundries in regards to the characters, they're all so familiar at this point that th movie can just let them be themselves and it's a great time regardless. The plot is simple yet dramatic, I really like the dystopian vibe in the beginning (Even though it goes out the window later on). The special effects are mostly really good, the action scenes are epic and enjoyable. One thing I do really like though, is how smart the movie is in its obsession with references. Most of the runtime is taken up by references to the older movies in the series, and it uses elements from all of them, just enough to create a storyline that's just barely not too nostalgia-bait-y. I also really like that some things have consequences in the end, even though the ending most certainly is a happy one. Overall, it's a fun, cheesy, very enjoyable movie with not much depth, but with the large scale and bombastic tone of an end to a decade-long journey, as is fitting obviously.",positive
"That is a typical example of a movie trying to squeeze juice out of a story that falls short.
X-men finished their old-cast franchise so much better, and darker, and better (sorry did I say better before...), yeah much better. Endgame is simply not up to par with the rest of the Marvell movies.",negative
"I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I actually did, there were some scene I didn't even see them comming.
I felt glue to the screen all the time, I even shed a tear, on thing I know for sure is that i'm a gonna miss a certain character..",positive
"Very good finish off of the series, although the first hour of the film was a bit dull😕",positive
"I was watched this movie. But, i didn't move on. This movie was very-very amazing and epic.",positive
Such an emotional movie.. after 11 years of battle members of avenger and this is the end..,positive
Had my dose of Avengers Endgame today. Started off pretty good and was going along fairly well then i said to my partner what happened to Captain Marvel she is hardly mentioned in the movie so far. Moving along the movie gets very serious and lots of laughs and crying and the going back in time comes up and they work out how and why. Stilling enjoying the movies but still wondering when CM is going to make another appearance . Great scenes followed with lost friends and family and time for the big battle and boy was it was battle when all seemed to be lost guess who made an appearance ever so short and sweet. The battle ended with the good guys coming out victorious and a little twist at the end . Gave it 9 stars not 10 as they could of done better hopefully there will be more captain marvel movies as i was left thinking is that it for her one movie and small parts in the Endgame.,positive
"Don't get me wrong I really do enjoy Marvel movies but i'm not a die-hard fan where I have seen every movie tons of times, read all the comics, andknow all the characters. With that said, that will definitely be a big factor on how much you will enjoy this. The more you know about Marvel, its characters, and the universe, the more you will enjoy it. Even for casual fans like myself it's still a really enjoyable experience with some enjoyable action, some pretty good comedic moments, and some heartfelt moments. In the beginning I was still trying to figure out who's who. It was difficult to discern who was who at the beginning (it didn't help either that there were very few name drops) but as it went on I started to get it more (and some characters like Iron Man and Thanos were easily recognizable.) And no, i'm not going to spoil anything in this review (most of the Internet has already done that anyways). But even with a bit of confusion it was far from enough to keep this from being an enjoyable watch. Plus it's not the movie's fault as that's how most of these movies are, depending on strong continuity and targeting the fan base more than anyone else. However it was pretty cool that they included scenes from some of their previous movies like the original Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America The Winter Soldier, but have it fit in with the time-travel aspect of this movie.Even for a casual fan like myself I was able to pinpoint which movies they were (thanks to the movie indicating what years each were taking place). It also didn't feel too out-of-place (albeit feeling a little weird to see the scenes pop up here.) It would have been nice if the movie started out with a little recap of what happened before and included scenes from previous movies to tie the story together, but it was still cool that they added those scenes in. I was skeptical of the three-hour running time but the movie managed to make it feel like it went by relatively quickly. It was also awesome that so many characters from all the different movies were in here. However it was a bit disappointing that I felt like some didn't get enough screen time like Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. Even Thanos didn't have as much screen time as I expected. But their appearances were still enjoyable and the final battle was AWESOME with all the characters coming together to help the Avengers out. It's easily the highlight of the movie (as it should be).Remember that this review was from a perspective of someone who hasn't watched a lot of these movies (and some were so long ago that it almost feels like I haven't watched them at all.) While I may not have loved this movie 3000, I definitely loved it somewhere around 2500.",positive
"So time travel. This just doesn't really ever work well, but as best it can the film tries. It goes the unexpected consequences route, and the new timeline route.There is some bravery pathos and humour in the aftermath of Thanos, and this gives the film a stronger emotional base than usual.I like the fact that Thanos is still smarter and ultimately more principled than the Avengers.But we get the usual dilution because of the number of characters not really involved. Or who just pose. And Captain Marvel appears to have suffered some reduction in her role, but still looks highly unbalanced.But the strength of the film is in the end which while not amazing is one of the better series ends I have seen.",positive
This film was incredible. I was left on my seat the whole time and there is something about having an all-star cast on a film that really amps up each scene. Awesome movie with powerful values.,positive
"Let me say before hand. I love the Russo brothers when they direct a movie. They did the best they can with the four movies they have done before (The Winter Solider, Civil War, Infinity War, and now Endgame). I loved the final battle and it was the most memorable thing I have seen in the theater. To say that this film is impossible to make is an understatement. Endgame did the impossible and made the ending conclusion of the original Avengers, for over 10 years. This made people laugh, cheer, and sob. When I saw this film on opening day I expected to have a happy miracle. There are some MCU films I love and hate. But that doesn't mean I love Marvel. I LOVE Marvel, ever since I was a kid I love the comics, shows and movies when I grew up. I started with Iron Man to now Endgame. But.... I didn't LOVE Endgame, I LIKE IT, but I DON'T LOVE IT. I felt like the Russo brothers didn't have full control in this movie. In Winter Soldiers, Civil War, and Infinity War I saw that they made their movies in their own way and they did it. Peter Quill got back on Earth and for the life of me I don't remember him seeing and recognizing the time he was on Earth, one line, look, or anything where they can see through. But what killed me was the 5 year time jump. WHY??? The MCU really love character development after 5 years. All the film does is show us anything of the off screen development. IT TELLS BUT DOESN'T SHOW. And the jokes aren't made from the Russo's but were probably told to include more jokes, and made sure they were immature. I could go so far. But I won't... I LIKE Endgame, but sadly I don't LOVE it. 7/10",positive
"First half plain boring, dialogues rubbish. Then it gets worse. A caricature of Thor, blurred action scenes, nonsensical time travel plot, weird Hulk, battle field done much better in Lord of the Rings and all of a sudden the whole Marvel universe appearing, where were there just 5 minutes before? And Thanos??? A sad follow up to an incredible infinity war.",negative
"INCREDIBLE! GREATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Wow! I never expected it to be as incredible as it was and yet it was. So many brilliant scenes. As someone who loved the MCU since 2008, this was everything i could've asked for. An epic achievement for everyone involved with this movie. Thank you, Marvel! Love you 3000.",positive
"Whether you like super heroes or not, you cant deny how incredibly well written and acted this movie is. Don't even worry about spoilers in this because there is so much happening. Remarkable job to Marvel Studios for putting together a movie that perfectly caps off so many movies they have released. You're missing out if you don't see this at some point.",positive
"You will never forget this movie! great emotions, story, vibe and action. the movie is a complete package and unlike other mcu movies this one is almost comic book accurate. Marvel used a different approach here, they had never shown time travel in one of their movies and time travel was obviously the last thing their fans expected but they delivered it. This movie was a unique experience, ending an era in style and the good part is that every marvel film seems to be even better than the last one.
Also marvel is trying to get into the new superheroes and most importantly using the cinema to get their new characters recognized. this 21 film series is the best film franchise there is. although old characters died in the movie but i am glad that they are looking this movie as an opportunity to expand the mcu and introduce new characters
marvel also did a great job keeping the spoilers. they did not announced the cast of mcu members who had died in the previous movies and also did not use any great spoilers in the trailer. i think they are the first ones after star wars to keep the trailer spoiler-free.
marvel also introduced humor into the franchise in this movie using thor and nailed it.
final remarks: the movie was well-directed and produced. cast was amazing and the animation was great.btw the most hyped scene was one cap wields the mjolnir and when doctor strange arrives with an army of mcu! hope you agree",positive
"In 2008, we all embarked on a journey of fantasy and adventure that would redefine the 'super-hero movie' genre, build a world of its own over eleven years and 22 films with beloved comic book characters created by Maestros like Stan Lee, and would culminate to provide what we now know as 'The Infinity Saga' of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
'Avengers : Endgame' is an epic, marvelous, emotional, and hard yet heart-warming conclusion to The Infinity SAGA. A well written and crisp script, a very well crafted character development, bonds and relations between those characters, the dynamics of their situation and how their character arc culminates in the story makes this a powerful movie which is supported by great graphics, action, and Science Fiction Stuff! There is a well maintained balance between action and emotion. The movie provides an emotional roller-coaster ride which makes you experience different emotions like sadness, happiness, hope, surprise, apprehension, disbelief, shock, humor, and keeps you on the edge. You laugh heartily, applaud with enthusiasm, and also sob in sorrow. It's also contemplative and shall provide you with nostalgic moments.
After the devastating snap called 'Decimation' that Thanos did in Avengers : Infinity War, half the life in the Universe is turned to dust, the world is in shackles, and our heroes are left defeated and devastated. But as It's suggest, some people move on... but not them! Thus, the Avengers assemble one last time and are ready to do whatever it takes to make things right and avenge the fallen. Will they succeed? That's what this movie is about.",positive
What a masterpiece! An amazing conclusion (although it was really sad),positive
"Something like this movie never happen again
Thank u MCU😀😀",positive
Not my favorite Spider-Man movie but definitely not the worst. I would say Spider-Man 2 was the worst instalment. Go see this if you have a chance!,positive
"This will probably be one of the shortest reviews I've ever written because I do not want to #SpoilTheEndgame for those who haven't seen it. So this review is more of an explanation of how I felt after walking out of the theater and there is no way to adequately describe the sort of visceral impact that this movie will have on audiences across the world.THIS WAS A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE UNLIKE ANY OTHER! THANK-YOU MARVEL STUDIOS!When a franchise takes you on a 22-film journey, over 11-years, it's safe to say there's a lot on the line for the filmmakers to deliver. I can't imagine the pressure the filmmakers felt with making this film. I felt unease going into Avenger's Endgame prior to the initial first reactions that were posted online. When I saw the glowing praise this film received, I was relieved, but that still didn't prepare me for the experience.You know a movie like this is going to deliver on the big moments. Huge set pieces are what Marvel Studios excels at. But you don't know just how well it's going to come together as a whole. My God, this film does it better than anything you've ever seen. If Infinity War was the movie that tore audiences down, Avengers Endgame is the therapy and revival that we all needed.This is a testament to the strength of great character building and storytelling. This film is a tribute to all the year's fans spent going on this journey. This film truly is a culmination of every ""phase"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Avenger's Endgame just proved that the world needs heroes. This is without question, the greatest superhero movie of all time, and arguably one of the best cinematic experiences ever. 10-stars!",positive
"...as a whole anyways.I venture in from time to time. In total, I've seen probably 10-15 percent of any and all of the combined universes. I thoroughly enjoyed the Batman triage and the Wolverine standalone film of a few years back...the rest either don't lure me in, or I take the lazy route of ""I never followed them...why start.""With that said, I buckled down and watched this with apprehension...and low expectations. I needed some escapism and this delivered, plain and simple. I came away with---yes, it's long but, I do think the overall length allowed for ""newcomers"" to be filled in on characters, the protagonist's storyline, as well as the preceding chapter of this story, which apparently happened ""5 years earlier""When the film started, I was worried I didn't know enough, but dont you worry---there's was plenty of information and it unfolds fairly seamlessly, and to me, it looks like by design, and is also very smart.With that said, this one delivers a true guilty pleasure sort---much like the latest Kong, Godzilla and Star Trek reboots. They capture my now lost youth, plain and simple, and I guess I hesitantly embrace this.You dont watch this for the acting or the dialogue. You watch for action, splody stuff, and good v evil. All are prevalent, all are fun sequences to watch unfold and the third act delivers the goods.No spoilers but it's a bit melodramatic for my liking at times, but prepare yourself for an onslaught of Easter eggs, cameos and a tidy enough ending for me to give this one the appreciative nod of approval.7 stars.",positive
"WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THE RUSSO BROTHERS,,,,, After you did a terrible job of messing up the hulk in infinity war you then made it worst in endgame with nonsense professor hulk and to add insult to injury you also mess up thor,,,, you suck Russo Brothers,,,, you did such a fantastic job with the winter soldier and civil war two of my favorite movies,, what went wrong with endgame,,,,, you took two of the strongest and best avengers and turn one into a big slob and turn hulk into a big stupid teddy bear,,,,, seriously disappointed.",negative
10/10. nothing more to say. still not best superhero film ever (The Dark Knight & Dark Knight Rises are the only ones in front). but best marvel film,positive
"By the time I'm reviewing this, I've already booked a ticket for a second watch. I've may not watched the entire MCU films yet, but I've been following the series since IRON MAN 2, so I'm more or less a fanboy (and I'm eager to watch the other ones later). But, I will try to remain as unbiased as possible and not spoil the story. In the case of this movie, I've already prepared for what's going to happen... or so I thought?Man oh man, where do I begin?By this point, (almost) everyone has watched ""Infinity War"" and been anticipating the next big thing. The movie started with the heroes feeling scattered and somewhat hopeless. All kinds of emotions are stirring inside them as they are desperate to fix what's happening around them. One way or another, they found hope and a possibility to restore what has been lost and unjustly taken. But, it also comes with a price, and it ain't cheap.That's the best way I could describe the film without going into spoiler territory. The other thing I would say about it is that it takes inspiration from other films and pay tribute to them in a way that feels fresh and exciting. Most importantly is how they put their whole heart on their sleeves. It's really hard to go through this movie without trying to hold back tears, and not laughing. It's also appropriate as it is the culmination of what came before in the MCU and astoundingly achieves a balance of emotional catharsis and genuine humor throughout.I can't deny how uniformly strong the performances are, most notably Robert Downey Jr. Since he started in Iron Man, we've been seeing him grow as a character and it is a career-defining role. He almost stole the entire film with his tour de force acting. He really caught me by surprise by how nuanced and heartbreaking his story has been taking him through. I doubt the Oscars would consider a nomination for him for the second time, but it's still well-deserved. Other standouts are Chris Evans and Scarlet Johansson, even Chis Hemsworth. Captain America has been a really stoic character, but now he gets to flex his emotions a bit more and my lord, how satisfying it is. Black Widow wasn't given a lot of character arc before but now is put into the forefront, not only she radiates sadness through her eyes, but also desperation and longing which is rare to see in the MCU. Thor grew on me more and more since THOR:RAGNAROK, and he balances humor and drama with aplomb, especially in showing his emotions. Honorable mentions goes to Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Paul Rudd and Karen Gillan. I've never seen Hulk as this balanced and neutral character. Hawkeye has never been grittier. Ant-Man is always the comic relief but here also provides as a ray of light in the darkness with his wit and dry humor. Surprisingly, Nebula is the character I've never seemed to care about, only to shred her layers of toughness and see her sad vulnerability.There's still so much to unpack and unload in this unbelievable 3-hour movie and yet, it doesn't feel like one. Granted, it does get a bit long and messy at times, but that's part of the story and it somewhat enhanced my involvement in it. Even great movies tend to drag sometimes, and this one has such a clear-cut vision so it's forgivable. Again, nothing's perfect.Narratively speaking, it's as satisfying as a finale can be. Just when you think it would go this way, the movie goes to another. There's still so much surprises in store and I thought it sticks the landing. The overarching theme speaks volumes and struck a chord in me.I cheered, I laughed and I (almost) cried. Basically, an emotional rollercoaster and easily one of the most unforgettable movie-going experience I've ever had and I can't wait to watch it again to soak it all in (maybe the second time I'll cry haha).They ended the era with a bang, and I'm looking forward for what they still have in store for us.",positive
I've never seen a movie like that in my life it was perfect in every way and when we talk about Oscar winning movies this better be on the ballot next year as well as the Russo brothers and Robert Downey jr. Heck the whole cast absolutely classic forget Gone With the Wind this is the greatest movie ever made.,positive
"I don't care what any critic has to say, but the MCU is brave and brilliant. This interweaving, interconnecting series of 22 films (23 with Spiderman Far From Home) has gone from strength to strength and I absolutely love Endgame as it basically closes the curtain on the Infinity Saga.The Marvel Cinematic Universe works because it is character driven!When Cap wields Mjolnir, I basically nearly peed in my pants with excitement.Bravo Marvel for breaking the mould.I cannot wait for more",positive
It was amazing and all but I personally enjoyed black widow and I didn't want her to die,positive
This movie was perfect. I'm literally in shock and awe as to how this movie wrapped up 22 movies so perfectly and how all-encompassing it was. The greatest cinematic event of my time. All that's left to say is thank you for the ride MCU.,positive
"Is it epic? quite so.
Is it fun to watch? quite so.
Is it everything you'd expect this type of movie to be? Sorta, I guess?

"For a movie that was advertised as the ultimate ending to the 3rd phase of Marvel's superheroes, I was a bit disappointed. It took 1.5 hrs to actually get started, involved a lot of nonsensical crying and weak build-up to the real story. The action was quite engaging but when the wizards finally teleported everyone onto the battlefield, it was too confusing because you barely knew where anyone was in relation to everyone else. Too much SJW pandering, but what else do you expect from Disney and Marvel nowadays, quality content with serious issues being treated seriously?I like the movie for what it truly was - the ending to a great saga. But let's not kid ourselves - this is a kids movie with tons of product placement. It had some great action, but the best one was the practical stunts and fight choreography, not the CGI moments in front of green screens. Could have been a full hour shorter and with less fake tear-jerking moments that actually had no true value other than they were fully forced upon viewers. Also, many of the emotional moments were ruined by stupid jokes, and the great jokes were sparse. I am glad it's over.",positive
"I cant believe people think this is 8.8, in a normal world this film is around 6, Infinity war is around 7, and some teenagers watch this at the cinemas and no one remembers it after a month.",negative
"Avengers end game was last part of Marvel Cinematic Universe's phrase 3. It was enjoyfull and kinda nostalgic. This movie was full revise of last 12 years of mcu journey. More likely a complete package of action,emotion,comedy and so many things. Totally worthy for watching.",positive

"Awesome full 3 hours entertainment.After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.",positive
This film served as an ode to 11 years of hard work as shown by the excellent callbacks via time travel. Each major character had their moments to shine. My favorite was the last 40 min fight scene which catered to what the fans wanted.,positive
"A movie full of action, drama, superhero moments and many many more... This movie can NOT be topped! For me it had everything we need... and more!!! Captain america and Iron man get finaly what they diserved!! Everyone in this movie has their shinning moment!!! In this movie i cried, i laughed, i screamed and i was going CRAZY!!! It had the right amount of drama in the begging (maybe a little bit more). The drama for me was necessary, because our heroes need to realise that they lost and that half of the entire universe has dissapeared!!! If you thought that infinity war was an epic movie wait till you see this one!!! WOW!!! I can not explain to you what i see i can not explain how epic this movie was!! you just need to go and see it! THANK YOU STAN LEE THANK YOU KEVIN FEIGE THANK YOY RUSSSO BROTHERS AND THANK YOU MARVEL FOR THIS AMAZINNG AND EPIC 11 YEARS!!!!",positive
"Please keep in mind that this score is coming from a person who is NOT a fan and that this is still a generally positive review.For the first time for me, I must credit the Disney front office, and especially Feige, for pulling off one of the most ambitious projects in film history. It has become clear to me that this entire 22 Marvel movie series beginning with Iron Man was taken very seriously by everyone involved, and while I respect the directors' visions for each movie, having the oversight over the entire Marvel project was what really made the franchise an unprecedented success.Now that being said, onto the movie itself. I'll avoid spoilers, so I'll just say I came out feeling just whelmed for this movie. Unlike Infinity War, Endgame felt more like the typical Marvel movie to me, and that means for negatives it suffered from some pacing issues for the sake of exposition, its music especially during more lowkey scenes felt uninspired, and emotional scenes felt very subdued due to some directorial choices, whereas Infinity War did a lot to cut fat and, perhaps due to its position being 2nd to last chronologically, had some actual impactful scenes.For Endgame specifically, there was a ""thing"" about it that also felt very out of place in contrast to what the tone was (if you've seen the movie you'll know what I'm talking about).But with these negative points in mind, there were some VERY gratifying scenes, both for those Marvel fans (which I didn't care too much about) and for those who understand what kind of expectations this film needed to meet. And because of these scenes and their execution, I didn't feel cheated out of an ending and I can understand why fans would cry.Congratulations Marvel fans, it's very rare that a fanbase can see their media being remade to still meet their high demands, and I think Marvel has done it for you guys.Just please keep discussion open though. Just because someone doesn't feel as strongly as you do does not mean they disrespect your opinion; some people enjoy asking the tough questions to get to a deeper truth.",positive
Go watch it won't reveal much. It's very well done.,positive
"The more I think about the plot holes, character arcs, and use of time travel the less I actually enjoy it.Avengers: Endgame is the capstone movie and conclusion of 10 years of Marvel movies as envisioned by Kevin Feige. While Infinity War successfully brought together almost all of the Marvel movie characters onto the big screen - Endgame focuses on the original core Avengers which gives it a more intimate and character-driven feel but less epic than Infinity War.This more intimate feel lets the first act of the movie, which focuses on the aftermath of the snap, shine better than the middle and climax in my opinion. We find our heroes living their lives and doing their best (or not, we'll talk more about that in a bit) to assuage their pain and move on: Captain America holds counseling sessions with survivors, Tony Stark has a young daughter who he loves dearly, and Thor, well, let's just say you may have heard a few nasty words from him on Xbox Live. He's also fat now. Lazy. Probably not worthy anymore. And I have to say his arc in this film is what brought the movie down for me. In Infinity War and previous movies, he's had to overcome his own arrogance, some red stuff, family drama and taking a supernova to the chest. While I understand failing to take out Thanos and letting half of all life get extinguished would get you down in the dumps - the beer-swilling, Xbox-playing, shutin seemed like a gag that went on way too long. I absolutely hated Thor's arc in this movie. Which brings me to Hulk, or should I say Professor Hulk now. Somehow, in the 5-years between them finding (and killing) Thanos, Bruce Banner somehow figured out how to merge his personality and the Hulk's into basically a big green mishmash of Hulk and Banner resulting in an almost-Hulk with the personality of Dr. Banner. Again, gimmicky at first and useful to move some of the plotpoints along (the reverse snap) but ultimately wasted as Hulk never had a chance to redeem himself, even slightly, against Thanos. Thor and Hulk were my biggest two problems with the movie.The second act of the movie finds the Avengers going on a quest to obtain the Infinity stones by engaging in a ""Time Heist"". Yes, there is time travel in this movie which if you don't pay attention and/or haven't watched the previous Avengers movies may end up confusing you. Albeit, it was a very cool ode to the previous movies in the Avengers' saga. Ultimately, it just was not coherent enough, for me anyway. Oh and we had better thank that rat the accidentally walked over the buttons and reactivated the quantum tunnel in AntMan's van. Way too convenient for my tastes.In the final act of the movie, the Avengers do manage to get all the Infinity Stones and reverse the snap. But it was not without cost and of course, not without some splinter in their plans. A mighty big splinter. ""Bad"" Nebula replaced ""good"" Nebula and let ""past"" Thanos travel through the time portal thus threatening all the work they did to get the Infinity Stones. However, this isn't the Thanos we remember from Infinity War, this Thanos has been reduced to a two-bit villain who now just wants to snap everything away and start over; still formidable mind you, but with none of the depth of Infinity Thanos. Quite disappointing. I know this movie wasn't his but it would have helped to feel like the Avengers' plans could have been spoiled if he had been a more threatening villain. But he wasn't and also took the movie down for me.I know it sounds like I'm dumping all over this movie but the moments that shined? They really stood out. Good ol' Cap weilding Mjolnir; Iron Man snapping away Thanos and his army; the end battle scene and Tony's funeral, which was really touching. But that's about it.All in all, I did enjoy the movie but in no way did it live up to the hype for me.",positive

"After the disappointing and Malthusian mistakes of the first part of the first Avengers finale in Infinity War the Russos and the Marvel team left all in the field in this monumental deeply emotional and deeply satisfying conclusion of the 11 years story that began in May 2008 with the coming back to his feet after many personal battles of the perfect actor for that role that would bring forth the coming of the Marvel Universe, this truly begins with the casting of Robert Downey Jr. as the arrogant man who back then in the 2008 film Iron Man, the maiden film of the Marvel Universe it is not like some people say that the Marvel team and Feige made Marvel there is one man who made and built the tower of the Marvel Universe and all began that 2008 May with Robert Downey Jr.´s Iron Man that made about 99 million dollars opening weekend and Iron Man grossed over 585 million dollars globally. Iron Man 2 made over 623 million dollars globally and began seeding the seeds of what would become an interconnected Marvel Universe. Others Avengers would come through the years with Natasha played by Johansson in Iron Man 2 and then Clint played by Renner in Thor these two always real and good friends would go to Vormir trying to find the accursed Soul Stone which terribly demands the sacrifice of a love one to get the Soul stone, next there are ones of the most terrible wrenching scenes of the Marvel Universe are seen as the two real friends who liked to remember Budapest very differently. Natasha and Clint both tried to up and one and tried different and more brutal wrenching ways to die to save the other. Clint may have always won his battles with Natasha earlier but in his weakest moment having thinking he had saved Natasha, he tells her to tell to her family that he loves them and impossibly Natasha just finds a way to save Clint with her own sacrifice, Clint in one of the film saddest scenes begs Natasha to stop this and let him be and then she just let go to the scarlet death below. Clint wakes up with the Soul stone with tears in his eyes when one the former lovers of Natasha in Banner hears about her death he feels despair in Endgame there are sacrifices and the closing of the circle and the loop. With Ant-Man back from the Quantum Realm after five years which only lasted about five minutes. Lang lobbies the idea to Rodgers and Natasha to Stark who married the woman who fix him in the 2008 film Iron Man, Stark has a daughter who loves him 3000. When Rogers, Ant-Man and Natasha lobbies the idea of a quantum time machine to Stark who at first refused saying about how he had a second chance with Potts and his daughter. Stark reveals to his wife Potts played by Paltrow that he had found a way to make a time machine quantum realm and maybe they have a chance to save all the people when Thanos made his infamous snap with his gauntlet and the infinity stones. The moment when Stark makes his decision to potentially lose his wife, daughter, his idyllic life is when Stark sees the picture of young Parker in the Stark internship and sees the boy and deep down feels the sadness when the boy vanished under his hands in Titan and then an idea appears in Stark what if he can bring back young Parker and hugged him. A team is made and Thor joins and Natasha finds her friend Clint in Japan and who after her family died in the Thanos snap had become a vigilante and he joins her for the mission. There are a pills that are able to bring back the teleport quantum time machines, these are the size Altering Pym Particles that must be used to be brought back to the present. The Avengers then tried from the first time they met the Infinity Stones with Loki Mind´s stone in 2012 then Rodgers and Stark to retrieve the Tesseract, the Space stone they returned to the 1970s and Stark then saw his SHIELD father Howard and share warms moments and Tony finally realized that his father could never be the perfect father but he did love his son withstanding all his many faults. Rodgers accidently enters the office of his love of his life in Peggy Carter who still remembers her past love in the recruitment photo of young Rogers measuring the 5 feet 4 inches and forever in her heart and always in Rogers heart who in the office of Peggy, Rogers sees how Peggy is fighting which what appears to be her husband and Rogers´ replacement and Rodgers is seen disappointed, angry seeing the woman he loved and knowing he could treat her better than the man that replaced him. Then with the reality stone with an appearance and cameo of Portman in Asgard in 2013 then the Power Stone in 2014 is found by present tense Nebula and when she tries with Rhodes to come back to the past her past connection when he is inspected by Thanos henchmen and Thanos is able to fully access of all future Nebula´s memories. Thanos is able to learn the Avengers plans and sends past Nebula to the future as spy. Then Hulk Banner and Iron Man are able to construct a new Iron Man gauntlet that Banner Hulk being made of Gamma rays sagely is the one to take the gauntlet and snap back with all the infinity stones all the people who died in Thanos first snap in Infinity War. Hulk Banner is nearly killed but survives the snap then the spy past Nebula with one of the size Altering Pym Particles is able to bring back Thanos and his forces. The past Nebula is tasked with bringing Thanos with the infinity stones and gauntlet and she tries to do so until seeing that there is no redemption for her past Nebula self, future Nebula kills her former self. Strange with Wong manages to bring all the Avengers, Black Panther, Ant Man, Rocket, Rhodes, Scarlet Witch comes back played by Elizabeth Olson but always heartbroken with the loss of Vision then Scarlet Witch almost singingly defeats Thanos who simply tells her that they have never met her for time dilatations. Stark finally seeing Parker finally does what he always had wanted to do and gives Parker a strong fatherly hug almost a goodbye. The battle rages and in one of the best scenes of Endgame the leader of the Avengers Captain America said the words Avengers Assemble and the real fight begins. Thanos and Avengers forces fight to a standstill until superior air power in Captain Marvel come to change the balance of power and now Thanos finally have a true contender. One of the plans that Thanos would not be able to use the infinity stones gauntlet is use of one of Ant Man old quantum cars but Thanos is able to destroy it. The super power fight between Captain Marvel and Thanos begins as Danvers is stronger and is about to defeat him but the Titan conniving uses one of the infinity stones the Power stone and is able to subdue Danvers. After Captain Marvel and before her, Thor fighting and Captain America wielding the thunderous Asgardian weapon Mjolnir and even Stormbreaker who those whose are worthy. Strange sees what is going to happen he gave the time stone to Thanos in Infinity War just for this moment over 14 million seeing of the future permutations and when Stark asked Strange about if this was the future they won, Strange said that he may not spoil it. Strange called the best of us by the Supreme Sorcerer the Ancient One in New York in 2012 by Swinton to Banner and the Ancient One gives Banner Hulk the green time stone. Strange had already seen this before and his wisdom in not telling Stark about his coming great sacrifice when Stark knowing his own technology and his own infinity stone gauntlet took and robbed Thanos of the Iron Man infinity gauntlet just in time when Thanos would do a second infinity stones snap and Stark instead makes his own infinity stones snap to destroy all the armadas and armies of Thanos, the titan seeing his defeat is the last to disintegrate to the ash and dust he wanted others to suffered instead of him. Potts leaned that the damage that Stark has is critical, Rhodes, a sad Parker tried to talk to the wounded Stark that they won and Stark is now agonizing. Potts in tears the woman behind the great man and who did fix the mess of arrogance that was Stark back then in one of the best parts of the 2008 Iron Man, Stark and Potts being his secretary and Stark all over her in a cocktail party and Potts in het blue dress being a decent and good woman knowing how womanizing Stark was and that her boss was talking to her romantically. Potts did in fact cared deeply and love Stark and wanted him to change and Stark does change for her girl and gives the best advice to Rodgers get some of that life. The Afghanistan 2008 Heart Power bond removal in 2013 movie says that this shows that Stark did have a heart. In his last moments the energy gamma force field where the heart of Stark died down. Rodgers´s last mission is to bring all six infinity stones to be returned to the proper moment to maintain universal normalcy he can take all the time needed and then come back to the present in five seconds. Rogers never comes back there is an old man who is sitting alone in a bench not far away and Sam comes to see him and recognized him as old Rogers now an old man maybe 100 years old. Old Rodgers admits that he never came back because he followed his friend Stark advice get some of that good life. Sam then gets sad that the world no longer has Captain America, old Rodgers gives Sam a gift a wrapped Captain America shield. Sam hopes to honor Rodgers´s legacy. Sam sees the wedding ring in old Rodgers and jokes if he wants to talk about her, old Rodgers said he does not and like anyone who theorized with a return of lovers with a time stone with Age of Ultron Scarlet Witch passions about Peggy Carter and Rodgers dancing in that promised dance when in the last part of Endgame the soldier that always sacrifice for country and all finally in his house he dances with his wife and love of his life Peggy Carter. Endgame is the end of the stories of heroes Captain America, Rodgers and the maker of the Marvel Universe Stark, Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr.",positive
"This movie is absolutely everything that a superhero movie should contain. Finding the courage to do what others can't and taking the hit along the way. Tony stark set out to do what he did in the first avengers movie "" Avenge the earth"". To the dismay of most, it cost him his life. With that being said balance has been restored to the universe and the world hqs him to thank for it. Heroism at its finest!",positive
"I spent 10 years of my life watching the Infinity Saga. 10 years from the age of 15, through to my mid 20s. 10 years watching every release without fail, every mid and post credit scene, every trailer and teaser. I spent countless hours reading theory's, watching YouTubers find Easter eggs and reading comics to help piece it all together.I don't even care that some might not be as good as others, they all told one big story. Every single one of these films means so much to me and I can barely put into words the part they have played in my life. I found confidence in myself by having this amazing shared experience with so many others and I will never forget those incredible 10 years.No matter where life may take me, these films are home.",positive
"How do you conclude a 11-year old saga in a way that doesn't mess things up? It does sound like a near impossible task, but the Russo Brothers have surprisingly accomplished it.'Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbounding and surely an enthralling experience. The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humour, emotions and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climatic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humour doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.However, there are a few parts that haven't hit the mark. The slow-paced story doesn't have a great impact on the film. The first half is very slow and a bit boring and it could have been better, but the second half just overshadows it with the astonishing moments. Thor had always been good enough in the previous films to grab the attention of the fans, but the filmmakers have ruined him in this film. The character who should have been one of the wisest characters is just shown as the biggest joke of the film. It was really interesting and fun to watch Captain Marvel interact with the Avengers, but had she been given more screen time, it would have been more satisfying. Another disappointing fact is that it's no match to 'Infinity War'.'Avengers: Endgame' isn't the best Marvel film. Nor is it a flawless superhero film, but that doesn't change the fact that it's one of the most satisying conclusions ever. 'Endgame' gives the perfect send-off to our favourite superheroes. This is a sheer spectacle full of twists, turns and suprises. At 3 hours, it does feel long, but the stupendous performances and the character interactions make for a fun and an energetic ride. It's the cinematic event of a lifetime, which you cannot afford to miss.",positive
"The MCU's long goodbye to the Avengers comes off as truly epic and thunderously exciting.they have somehow brought 10 years of story and character to a natural, satisfying conclusion
Well Done 👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽",positive
"Great movie... I really applaud it for having a clear structure, as there was a distinct beginning, middle and end. The story was really well told. It had a great balance of comedy and seriousness. It was really gripping and was able to evoke a lot of emotions.My only 'critique' is that I think the beginning was too slow. To explain, although I think that segment was fantastic as a whole and I recognize that it gave context to the rest of the movie (and it did that well)... ultimately, I think it would have been beneficial to cut out some of those scenes.Apart from that, I have no complaints. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it was a brilliant ending to the avengers series.",positive
"Not as bright as everybody saying, Endgame is full of plot holes, and for plot hole I mean holes in their own rules. I accept every kind of belief suspension - Superman flying, time travel in Back to the Future, sounds of explosions in Star Wars. But I can't accept Superman with telecinetic powers for convenience, Midiclorians, or the convoluted timeline in Terminator Genesys. Moviemakers cannot break their own game rules. Furthermore, time travel is a danger way to go in movies, afterall, in next Marvel phase nothing that happens will be a real concert once there will be this solution under the table.This movie is very satisfying...once you turn off your brain.But....Acting is top notch.
Comedy is top notch.
There are some surprises and unpredictable moves.
Thor is hilarious (for me the best part of this entire universe).
Characters are coerent with their values (unlike Snyder's Superman)Better than Avatar (most near comparable blockbuster)? Hmmm........ not.",positive
"Although I'm not a big fan of the Marvel saga and keep something out of date with all the movies, I've seen most of them and I consider them excellent forms of entertainment, each with special touches that make them very favorable to taste, but above all highlights the experimental creation of his ''cinematic universe'', a union of movies with different but related arguments. Endgame is the end to that great saga that for years was being built successfully to close with a golden brooch.It is a journey of action and fun, totally entertaining with excellent performances, amazing effects, an intense plot and above all a fantastic villain. Each of these factors manages to create a movie of great magnitude for entertainment, and I'm sure the most passionate fans will be satisfied with it.Although I don't consider myself an expert on Marvel, I consider this to be a high caliber movie for anyone that likes movies.",positive

Long movie that struggle to have flow during the 1st half. Ending made up for the 1st part. Great emotional ending scene with all of the characters coming back in a heroic scene. Had my daughter in tears-of joy. That in itself is an epic moment. Acting was solid by all characters.,positive
Movie was fantastic I love it I am big fan of Tony stark love you Tony,positive
"Avengers: Endgame is the highest-grossing move of all time. It has one of the best superhero scenes of all time. If you love Marvel, you will get chills! The Avengers get to a new level. This might be the greatest Marvel movie of all time, and it is worth the 3 hours. As it is a superhero film, not very much blood is shown. There are only streams of blood down the side of people's faces, a splatter of blood that is NOT visible on someone's face. Suitable for ages 8+.",positive
"When Infinity War ended last year I said to myself that there was no way the next Avengers film could ever surpass its greatness. Well, simply put I was wrong. Endgame brought the goosebumps caused by the rollercoaster of overwhelming emotions that enveloped the entire audience. Or maybe just me for I was clapping and cheering while the whole cinema remained reserved in its reactions. But anyways the film through its 3 hour runtime brought anticipation, excitement, and a rush of adrenaline through my veins. Every scene has this certain feel that makes you think that you're in the same mess as the main characters are. That aspect gave each scene a certain tension, that of which other films lack. A constant feel of danger so to speak but that also gives you the opportunity to laugh and... well like I said its a plethora of emotions really. I don't want to get in detail about everything in the film but wow, this is history and we get to tell our grandkids how it was to see it firsthand.
Simply astonishing 10/10 I am at lost for words really.",positive
"I won't say much but this was the greatest movie theater experience I've had since Avatar. I see there's a lot of one star terrorists who would never be satisfied, or who only believe in arthouse type movies that are non-fiction. If that's you, then ignore this review. We'll both be better off.The emotion, the tender love between characters who have been developed over the last 15 years, and just the general willingness to sacrifice everything for the greater good truly make the writing click in both infinity war and endgame. In addition, the writers were careful not to make it a requirement to see all 21 films leading up to this. Yeah, seeing infinity war and probably age of ultron is a must, and it will help you enjoy it more to remember some of the references from Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the two Guardians of the Galaxy films, but generally, infinity war explains anything you may not now going into it.As for the common complaint that 3 hours is too long, I will disagree. This is an end to a series on an unprecedented scale and it is totally worth your time.",positive
"Infinity loop. Now back to the past. Its the same. Too much emotional. Too much patriarcal. The women are atrezzo, they only stay in a second plane. Captain Marvel just talk two times. WTF! Disappointing. Meh.",positive
The most satisfying end to a saga that has captivated our imagination for the last 21 years.,positive
"Fun movie to watch and interesting twist of characters they did with Thor and Hulk.
But not worthy of 9/10 ... It's just a fictional superhero movie.",positive
"Blockbuster movies are made to entertain people and we mustn't expect logic, I fully agree with that. I had great fun watching MI: Fallout and Alita Battle Angel this year but Endgame turns out to be like every other superhero movie that came out this decade. The opening scene features Jeremy Renner losing his family after Thanos' actions in the last film, after that scene to till the end the movie just bombards us with video game like action sequences and unfunny jokes.The plot of the movie is much better most superhero films to its credit but the dialogue and screenplay was no different. While I don't want to spoil the plot, this film has bought back all characters associated with the MCU and is a reunion delight for many hardcore fans. The final battle sequence is my least favorite part of the film, it features random action sequences and right from the very start you would know how its gonna end. If you are expecting it to be like the ones you saw in The Lord of The Rings or Harry potter you are gonna end up disappointed.If this is Robert Downey Jr.'s last film as Iron Man as per reports its a great news for all movie buffs, a talented actor like him has wasted his last 5 years acting only in MCU franchise movies which didn't fully utilize his potential. Finally, this movie is going to be the biggest blockbuster of the year without any doubt but its only the beginning of end of the superhero genre.",negative
"Upon viewing Avengers Endgame a second time I can now state that this is one of the best cinematic experience I have ever felt when watching a movie. It has many different elements of genre that work so well together be it action, drama, laughter and many others. To put all these aspects into a 3 hour movie without the movie being overly stretched is a marvel in itself but that is what The Russo Brothers along with the writers managed to achieve.All the main Avengers characters have their time to shine and to the best effect possible. I will not mention any standouts because although there are main ones who truly shine this was much more really a team performance from all of them and I enjoyed each one of them in different ways. The visual effects of this movie are top notch that along with the score make the movie much better than it is.To conclude, I must mention Kevin Feige and the team behind Marvel Studios (including Stan Lee and Jack Kirby) who created a set of movies (characters and stories) that entered the cultural phenomenon of the world that even for those, like myself included, who are not avid fans of comic books must appreciate what a remarkable job they have done with this movie being the culmination of them all. So very well done and thank you for the amazing experience that you have allowed to cherish all my life.",positive
"3 Hours full of emotion, action, tears and laugh.This is how you end the filmBeautiful, impactful, amazing",positive
"This movie is a TRULY fitting end to phase 3 of the Marvel universe. My hat goes off to all of them for what they have made here. 100% satisfied.Directing, acting, script, music, action, effects all 10/10. Pacing and a few of the timeline technicals get a mark down, but honestly do not impact the film enough for it to be considered anything less than absolutely stellar.The emotional components of the film really truly carry much of what is taking place on the screen. I cried, about 5 times. Some occasions of which actually fully overwhelmed me. I can't name a film that has ever completely overwhelmed me emotionally before. Absolute credit to the acting and script writers for that one!If you have watched even a couple of the Marvel universe films, go see this film immediately.",positive
"OMG...
This movie is more than you could have imagined.It has everything what you can expect from a MARVEL movie but still it is more than that.It has Action,drama,comedy,emotion...you name it.
I don't have any word to describe the feeling.
Russo brothers created something which no one could have created.
And kudos to the writers also who knew exactly what people want from this.
Overall this is the best MARVEL movie ever and trust me you will laugh so much and cry so much.
Be prepare to have an awesome experience and shout as much as you can.
Maybe you will never get chance to shout this much.",positive
"First ever movie review and probably my last but to say it was a massive let down was an understatement And for me how the Russo's got it so wrong after their brilliant films that led to this is anybodies guess. All I can think is they ran out of ideas and made this political to keep the lefties happy. Winter soldier 8/10 was quality, civil war 9/10 even better and infinity war 10/10 just awesome in every way but to end on this was a total let down. Been watching all the films since the first iron man, and have them all on DVD , watched some even 4 or 5 times they are that good. Thor: Ragnarok was up there with IW for me. The plot holes in the previous films didn't bother me as they were so good I got past them but as this was so bad and boring it needs pulling apart since it has insulted all our intelligence. I gave it a 7 as the path that has been laid with all 21 films before this was pretty awesome to be fair but if this was a stand alone movie it would get a 5 or 6 maximum. Hawkeye had way too much screen time yet proper super heroes like scarlet witch, captain marvel, doctor strange, black panther to name a few were hardly in it. Personally I don't watch a superhero film for drama and drivel and sentimentally. There are plenty of other films out there that are aimed at that. I want decent but silly story and stupidly brilliant over the top action and silly mindless violence which is basically what IW was. For me the only thing that kept it going was the humor, as usual, like the effects both were pretty good but in the main a complete let down. I knew not to expect better than IW but as this is the ""big one"" it had the right to be better.
Probably 3 or 4 fight scenes before the big fight at the end which was kind of over before it began. The fights in the first 15 mins of IW out did the half a dozen or so here, including the ""gran finale"" Not sure why they ruined the hulk so much either. After his non appearance in infinity war and since Thanos battered him surely a hulk revenge fight would of been on the cards but what they did with hulk in this film, or what they didn't do is what we should be asking. Ruined Thor too. The 2 most powerful heroes and they pointless really. Was that to keep it all about Stark / Cap?. It seemed like a very very long soap opera trying to tackle the issues of the world, diversity being the number 1 and that's what they got wrong for me. But even if they wanted to keep the snowflake brigade happy, the scene where the females super heroes line up to sort everything out was a non starter too. Scarlet witch, captain marvel, Potts (Marvel seem to have forgotten that she has that fire power thing for Iron man 3) in iron man suit, okoye etc. So between them they can raise some hell again didn't really do anything. Where was Loki, heimdall I know they didn't die in the snap but neither did Thanos' 3 henhmem who all died in IW but somehow we're back. It tells you everything that one of the main talking points by critics celebrating MCU first openly gay character!!. Not really just a fat bloke sat around a group moaning about he lost his boyfriend in the snap. That scene was 3 minutes or so long and it was one of the directors playing him too. So in a film 3 hours long a gay character has 3 mins of fame and that's their way of tackling the so called diversity issues. It's called tokenism.We will never know why they ruined the film so badly especially after the build up of the previous films. I'm 46 and my son is 18 and he was gutted it was so bad.Just hope spider man gets back to where it should be...mindless entertainment and not politics!!!!",positive
"What began back in 2008 with Iron Man has grown in to this fully matured universe with excitement, awe, thrills and sadness, and finally it must come to its endgame. (Pun intended)From the start of the movie you're immediately reminded of the ending of Infinity War, thrust in to the affects of Thanos' snap, from this moment on the emotional ride begins. The movie manages to perfectly balance the action, plot moments, character arcs and character conclusions, and paces you along the way. From the get-go, you think you have this all figured out, what's going to happen but most of you will be wrong.The Russo brothers manages to bring this heavily invested universe to a close in what could be considered the greatest Marvel film to date with the largest ever assembled cast. I cannot recommend you see this just once however, the 3 hour run-time that this movies demands is warranted and satisfying but make sure you go to the toilet just before you watch it.And just to save you the time; this movie (fittingly) has NO after credits or mid credits scene.Enjoy!",positive
The first part was much better. This one feels like a letdown!,positive
"Review is pasted below from my original review of my blog back in April. Link for that is below as well, it's the same review with added links and visuals/photos. Thanks :)kunalatthemovies.movie.blog/2019/04/24/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review/Avengers: Endgame is directed by Marvel Studio veterans, Anthony and Joe Russo. They previously directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. (In my opinion they have directed some of the best MCU films) They are currently the only directors who have directed 4 films in the MCU.I honestly do not know where to begin, because I genuinely do not want to spoil anything about this film. On Wednesday April 24th I went for an early morning 3am advanced screening in Dolby Cinema of the film so that I can go in blind and avoid any kind of spoilers, and it worked brilliantly. I will be watching the film again on Saturday April 27th in IMAX, since it is the only film to be shot entirely (3 hours and 2 minutes) with IMAX cameras. I wish for all the fans to watch the film in the same way, go in totally blind and you will not be disappointed. This film works with surprise, shock and awe. One of the only other films that left the same impression on me was The Empire Strikes Back, which I believe is a film that the Russo Brothers highly admire, I mean who doesn't.Anyway, back to the MCU. I will not disclose any plot points of the film, I won't even provide any captured frames of the film/trailer. I will however talk about the aesthetics and qualities of the film.
The pacing of the film fluctuates slightly, I mean it is just over three hours long, but a welcomed three hours. Some people might find it a little too long, especially the first act. The first act is definitely a slow burn, but it has to be because of what happened at the end of Infinity War. It needed to be sober and built up to the recuperation of what the heroes just went through, the heroes we have grown to love over the past decade. However the pacing picks up significantly with a surprising and perfectly enjoyable fun second act; and a climactic third act that is emotionally hard hitting.
The musical score isn't groundbreaking but it does satiate the appetite of the visuals in the film. We have all heard and been pumped up by the Avengers theme, which this film uses a few times at key narrative points.What I love about the filmmaking of the Russo's is their viceral style that also manages to feel grounded where the viewer feels like a part of what is happening. In all their MCU films I never felt like a man in the sky watching over what is happening on the ground with the characters. They manage to frame the action where it feels intense and emotional yet without having confused close ups or a ""shaky cam"" effect, which unfortunately many action films do nowadays.
The production design and sets of Endgame are amazing, with a mix of practical effects and CG set pieces striking a perfect balance like never before in the MCU. Without giving away anything, I will say I was extremely surprised with a lot of the set pieces and ""things"" and ""stuff"" that happened.
Sorry I really can't go into any more detail than that. If you are a fan and have been following the MCU films, Endgame is something you will definitely enjoy and feel satisfied about. It manages to create ""fan service"" without compromising on quality or impact, be it emotionally or narratively.If you haven't watched most, if not all, of the previous 21 Marvel Studios films, then I have to say that this film will not impact you in the way that it is meant to. You cannot view Endgame as a solo self contained film. It is a culmination 3 phases and 21 films spanning 11 years. Yes each phase had an ""end,"" Phase One ended with The Avengers (2012), Phase Two ended with Avengers: Age of Ultron/Ant-Man (2015). But I would say those would be end of chapters, whereas Endgame isn't just the end of Phase Three or a chapter, it is the end of a book, the end of the Infinity Saga, honestly the end of an era.The entire MCU so far has been an overall success with a few films falling short in quality, Endgame brings it all to a satisfying close. The film takes risks and does a lot of unexpected things that I feel strengthen the film as a whole. It manages to somewhat breakaway from the formulaic superhero genre and manages to try and be something different. As Endgame climaxed, so did I and I honestly cannot wait to watch Endgame again on Saturday, this time in IMAX. It's going to be a whole different experience to a film I think is near perfect.Rating:
I am giving Avengers: Endgame a 9 out of 10.
Highly recommended to any and all Marvel fans and even the casual Marvel film goer. A gripping conclusion of a 21 film saga, I cannot wait to see what is the next step in the MCU. I am happy and thankful to Marvel Studios for making all these films and building this saga to a crescendo with Endgame. I laughed, I cried, I gasped, I was on the edge of my seat during this film. This whole three phase journey has been a wild ride, let's hope their next phases can hit the mark again and perhaps take it further. Until Spider-Man: Far From Home (which Kevin Feige has said is the actual last film of Phase Three) is released in July, Marvel Studios has said they will not officially announce anything about their future plans for the MCU. So we will have to just wait until post July 2019. However Disney finalized acquiring the rights of 21st Century Fox this year, so we can expect the X-Men and Fantastic Four to join the MCU in the near future. Also Disney+ streaming service is launching towards the end of this year so we can expect to see a lot more original content being shot and produced, from smaller budget feature films to original series based in the MCU. What can I say except 2019 is a great year for Marvel and Disney overall.",positive
Russo brothers can't fail to excite me the way they made the movie it felt like I was watching the comics but was nicely written and ouuuu had tears when iron man died and when cap turned old I was watching them since I was 6 yr old man it acc felt like an end of an era but anyways into Phase 4 !!!!,positive
"I am sort of sorry that the rares time I write a review, it is not a kind one.
But I am sorrier still that the rares times I watch theater movies, it is because of high ratings of previous reviewers.Yep, that is how i chose this one.""Astonishing"", ""perfect"", ""masterpiece"", ""9 out of 10"" were some of the comments and ratings around, so I thought, this must be it, if I have to see one movie this year, it's this one.But honestly :Special effects, are good.Plot is so plain you understand what is going to happen and how it is going to end in the first ten minutes. And there are no twists whatsoever.
Everything is pretty much recycled from other movies - not talking about ""avengers"" or marvel series; rather, just any SF movies out there were used as ideas sources to fill this one. Nothing new, nothing different.Yeah, there are a few nice jokes, and some fat, both so badly plugged you can see the stitching (you'll understand when you see it). In the past, when heroes were making jokes during a battle, it was to show they mastered the situation, and it was fitting the atmosphere and pace; in this one, you can see at some point the director absolutely wanted to put a joke in the middle of the main battle - broke the rythm and half spoiled the mood just because of that.Movie is three hours long.I just watched two episodes of an old anime series from the 80's, and in those 46 minutes, there was pretty much as much action and stuff going on than in these almost-three-hours of medium paced show. So although people say it was needed to fit all the references to previous marvel movies, i'd rather have less references and more things happening in this one.As it often happens in these follow-ups, previous movies created such an intricate situation that this one solved in such a straight-forward way, it felt as if somebody wanted it rushed to the finish.And in order to do that, it took the party of a lousy quantum physics theory (which is actually wrong, btw), and left some important side question unansweredAnd not to talk about the mania from the producers to destroy stuff that went on for décades, or millennia, all in the timespan of a few years! We had ragnarok, the death of Odin.. And now.. this?
Well without spoiling the movie for those that want to see it, I'd say it looked like they wanted to make sure that this put an end to the story. Even if that meant to break the logic of these movies : ""Thus far and no further we shall make avengers movies""
God complex, perhaps?All in all, it wasn't any better than an old Flash Gordon movie, except for the SFX that are of course more modern. I'm giving it a 3 out of 10, as 1 and 2 are reserved for movies that don't deserve watching till the end.
But I believe that once the paid comments and the avengers mania will be past, many other will downrate this, that definitely did not deserve all that advertising and praise it received so far.Definitely a cash movie, nothing more.",negative
"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has certainly revolutionised modern cinema; back in 2008, Iron Man opened to positive reviews but few foresaw the cultural phenomenon this world was to become and the generation of adoring fans it was to muster. Eleven years on and the highly anticipated climax of this particular saga of the MCU hits the screens; Avengers: Endgame. Its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War may have ended on a rather low note for Earth's mightiest heroes, as intergalactic despot Thanos succeeded in wiping out half the universe, but they return in full force in this ambitious and decidedly bombastic conclusion.
From the beginning, Marvel old hands The Russo Brothers paint a very new world, a greyer one wracked by Thanos' deadly 'Snap'. Among the surviving Avengers, there's a strong sense of survivor's guilt and very little sense of hope... yet it would be unlike the characters we know to not make one last attempt to save the universe.
To divulge in any more detail the plot of Avengers: Endgame would be to severely undermine its impact; this is a cinematic thrill-ride, with surprises aplenty, nodding dollops of fan service and a hefty level of emotional stakes. One thought the sheer scale of Infinity War was seismic, but the Russos outdo themselves with Endgame, crafting a climactic and grandiose, but equally satisfying conclusion to a decade of work. It's a different beast to its predecessors in many ways, but Endgame still manages to pull off that nifty balance between humour and drama that makes Marvel work.
The film can only be described as a victory lap for Marvel, a love letter to their characters and fans. After a brilliantly unexpected prologue, the film takes a little while to find its rhythm, but once it does... it really does. Credit is due particularly to Christopher Markus' and Stephen McFeely's script, a quick-witted and compassionate piece of work that propels the story breezily through its three-hour run time. Despite the Avengers' predicament, it isn't all doom and gloom; the benefits of a smaller ensemble cast allow Endgame to have that same sense of banter from Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble, something that occasionally felt missed within the tidal action of the latter part of Infinity War. Within the first hour, the plot is taken on a definitive path, one that is neither untrodden (there is a memorable comic sequence where the characters wryly commentate on this) nor particularly smooth (plot inaccuracies can easily be raised). Despite this, however, it allows the film to take off on what can only be described as a golden reward for Marvel fans, an action-packed feast of a film that pays due homage to its universe. There's also a biting edge to Endgame though in its emotional resonance, frequently heart-breaking yet never gratuitous. There are so many aspects that are so caringly rendered in Endgame; Alan Silvestri's diverse score and the textured visual effects spring eagerly to mind.
As always in a Marvel caper, the cast is a blisteringly good ensemble effort. In Endgame, every actor is on top form, bouncing off eachother with natural ease. Josh Brolin's scene-stealing Thanos from Infinity War is disappointingly less on show here, but this is almost made up for the excellent use of some of the previous film's more underused players (Chris Evans' Captain America and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow are given meatier roles here). A special mention should also go to Robert Downey Jr in a performance that radiates power and poignancy. Avengers: Endgame does sacrifice itself occasionally in the complex myriad of stories it tells; at points, there are a few too many of these vignettes and the film can feel a tad clunky (Infinity War gave the arc to its villain to combat this). However, the paths all lead pretty much perfectly together in a third act that is indisputably awesome and packs an emotive punch.
Avengers: Endgame is a monumental piece of cinema, both in scale and significance; these stories have defined childhoods and, here, a fitting end is delivered to this part that not only feels satisfyingly conclusive but is excellently put together by the creative force behind it. Colossal and captivating, this is another sure success from the team at Marvel that looks difficult to beat.",positive
"It's hard to rate this movie in any fair way. As a movie in itself it's maybe not the most fantastic thing you've seen, it's no Pulp Fiction, Her or Forest Gump. But as a movie in a series of films this is amazing. The different stories that has been told through Marvels characters all come together here in a perfectly balanced way. As all things should be.Seeing grown up men and women laughing, crying and cheering for their favourite hero is something I find fascinating and it's hard to find this kind of interaction in the cinemas. I simply love it.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is possibly the best example of how to give fans the best possible payoff for staying with the series. While it does drag towards the beginning, it does so to develop our characters and make the later scenes more emotional and tense. Overall, while I may enjoy Infinity War a bit better, this was still an outstanding film that serves as one of the best out of all superhero movies.",positive
What a movie it was I loved it did have a little bit of problems with it but it was great the last battle where they all fight Thanos army iron man sacrifice. Everything was great.,positive
Quite disappointed after demise of our beloved tony stark.... miss you 3000,positive
"No no I'm not crying, am I? MCU till here has invaded our hearts, it's been emotional, laughter, the love that is shown in irreplaceable.",positive
It was good but not great. The first hour is way to long. A nice ending and a good attempt with a lot of old references.,positive
"I am completed. Loved every minute of it, especially the last few!",positive
"This movie is better than the previous one, infinity war. Worth a watch as an entertaining movie, but I'm not impressed or have anything to remember",positive
"MCU first killed Jarvis, then killed Tony. I hate MCU. MCU and Disney are spoiling Marvel characters.",negative
"Wery wery good 10/10 mmmmmm, Nice!
Oh my God! WOW!!!!
Captain America and Third and Iron Man - good heroes!",positive
"I'm not giving you spoilers: this was everything you expected and hoped for. This is the most satisfying and inspiring end. This masterpiece brings you joy, tears, excitement and so much more. You definitely have to see it. When I first saw it Wednesday night, I was so overwhelmed that I've decided to see it again this Thursday!!",positive
"To summarize my experience, Avengers: Endgame was brilliant, I loved the use of a lot of characters and landscapes to portray just how seriously Marvel takes it's work. Unfortunately many illogical plots filled with holes, and I really dislike it when Studios project our time (Fortnite, feminist society, dabbing, etc) onto a film that kind of disrupts the flow, but anyways.. Thor's character progression?, funny but not the way I wanted it to go.There was just another non-movie related downside to watching this movie, for a few of us at least.. the amount of hysterical fans in the cinema just going beyond the expected amount of clapping and, to be frank, ruining some fight scenes for us. Be warned if you are going to go watch it this weekend, the same may happen to you.The unnecessary and excessive screaming completely disengaged me and interrupted a few scenes for me. But hey, in a few months I will be able to enjoy it from the comfort of my own home!",positive
"A thoroughly entertaining film which ticks all the boxes. A surefire sign that the film works is that despite being very long, the pace is perfect and keeps the viewer engaged throughout.The script is witty but never frivolous. The plot works well and is not overly complicated.The final chapters are a worthy conclusion to the franchise and are genuinely emotional.Highly recommended.",positive
"This is not just a movie its full of emotions.You gonna laugh you gonna cry you gonna cheer.Its everything you are all waiting for,
Just wanna say thank you to marvel studios for making this possible.",positive
"Um filme com as mensagens de vida e a vida de casa um. Herois humanos com uma produção espetacular.
Vale a pena ver.",positive
"Regrettably, this installment of the Avengers franchise falls short. Despite my appreciation for the previous films and some enjoyable and humorous moments in this one, it fails to maintain the momentum of its predecessors. The story lacks the excitement and energy of the previous movies, and the dialogue is uninteresting, resulting in dull and tedious sequences.The Avengers appear to be a clumsy and awkward group, posing for a photo like a bad high school reunion. However, I, like many others, have been a fan of the Avengers franchise for years, though this particular film did not meet my expectations.The character of Captain Marvel, with her overwhelming powers, appears to be overdone and simplistic, with no real challenge or reason for her to lose a fight.One may question whether a large collective of all the heroes was truly necessary. It seems that it was not.Furthermore, certain scenes drag on for too long, adding nothing to the already thin plot. Additionally, the absence of Dr. Strange, who possessed a crucial aspect of the story, was disappointing, as he hardly had anything to say and made only a brief appearance.",positive
All MCU premieres are good but hats off to Sir stan lee for a remarkable ending.,positive
Well all i can say is i didn't see that coming i ended up going to watch this movie on opening weekend oh boy what a mistake i got stuck in the front row and could only see a third of the screen lol ! other then that this movie was really entertaining so many great action shots and man this time you felt like the bad guy had the upper hand you can almost feel how down the Avengers are after the last movie don't want to give anything away but its a good time for family's or grown children both will be very entertained,positive
"I know the reviews say differently. But it sucked.Could have been so much better.So impossibly random that a malfunction would happen to let Thanos see the pasts future which is impossible even for superhero movie standards.Plus if you had the all powerful hand you could have controlled the event and caused your not death. Just saying.And why was it so easy to chop hand and head in one scene but then, So difficult to handle Thanos with more super power hero's at the ready??Thor fat??? Just dumb, ruined the movie for me.Part one was just so good and flowed so well.",negative
"I've seen many reviewers on here bashing this movie for a lot of reasons. Logic Flaws, Dialogue, too long and drawn out, or simply that it lacks emotion because it's isn't non-fiction. These are the same people who would bash the movie for being too rushed or for the opposite of what I described above. They fail to understand that we don't go to movies to watch non-fiction, but to be entertained; and the duo of Infinity War and Endgame is as entertaining as it gets.Without giving any spoilers away, let me just say that when I saw this movie it was a completely full theater. The entire audience applauded 3 times and there was even one scene (you'll know it when you see it) where they all stood up to clap and cheer. Never in my years and years of moviegoing have I ever seen that happen and this is coming from someone who goes to movies every weekend. This is what happened so you be the judge as to whether all these one-star terrorists deserve the attention they get.Like the first part of the story, it has moments that will blow your mind, break your heart, make you laugh, and shatter your soul, occasionally in the same scene. Never in my life have I seen a fictional universe so carefully crafted to the point where I am made to care for every character and where emotions are raging throughout in so many different ways. Given that there are over 60 of these characters, that is very difficult to pull off and this movie did it.These two movies are an experience like no other and is one for the ages.",positive
"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.
One of the best movies I have seen. Ever. I am going to see it again next weekend. I had it spoiled for me but watching it happen. That experience can never be spoiled. I laughed one minute and cried the next. It tugged at heart strings and tickled the funny bone whilst including the mandatory amount of action any Marvel movie needs. All round perfect.",positive
"Absolutely heart breaking from beginning to end. I'm not going to sit here and spoil the movie for anyone, but if you love Marvel movies you'll love this.",positive
"Ok so I will be short and succinct. With 21 films worth of storyline to tie up in 3 hours, it was almost impossible to please everyone. The fact that the story was so cohesive, and had such a satisfying resolution to so many charachter arcs is a minor miracle in and of itself. But what truly impressed me, and honestly, what separates the Avengers from every other comic book franchise, is the way the actors absolutely WEARS their charchters and make you love them. The decision to concentrate on the original core group, although not popular with everyone, was a sound one in my opinion. This was their movie. Chris Hemsworths Thor has especially come such a long way. But anyway. Loved the movie. Laughed. Cried. Left feeling satisfied. And all the loose ends were neatly tied up",positive
"SPOILERS SPOILERSI loved the movie! There were some awesome moments in the movie that were beyond words. I will not talk about those moments, per se except to ask questions, but I have a few questions that I have for things that don't add up. These are addressed here:No one really knows the rules of time travel in real life, but there has to be things that I believe would be obvious.
1) How can future Nebula shoot herself from the past and still be alive.
2) Wouldn't doing what the Avengers planned and completed made what Thanos did in Infinity War obsolete? Since Thanos was killed before he completed his Infinity War mission, would that not make many of the Marvel Movies irrelevant? It would make Infinity War irrelevant for sure.
3) When Spider-Man returns to school he sees his friend. In the new movie it appears the core group is still together. Maybe the movie will explain it, but that what indicate every one of Parker's friends were directly affected by Thanos' snap.
4) How could Captain America going back in time and staying there not affect the future and how it transpired? Rogers would have to be a total Social Recluse and never go outside.
5) Since Gamora comes back due to the sacrifice of someone else, wouldn't that mean that people like Ludlow and Alexander Pierce are now still alive? Is Gamora still alive? You see Quill looking at a picture of her, but not her.
6) THIS IS NOT A QUESTION BUT MY BIGGEST NEGATIVE IN AN OTHERWISE GREAT MOVIE- I did not like the fact they bringing everyone lost back 5 years later, I get Stark's point of view on this, but this would be disastrous for the 3.5 Billion coming back to life to a world in shambles. I also wish the Time/ Space aspect was more seamless. It seems like they took some liberties on how it could logically work.",positive
There are a handfull of lose ends that people may choose to focus on and a few characters dont quiet get their moment to shine but this was an amazing film. It doesnt feel like 3 hours (like I care I'm looking forward to a back to back viewing with Inifinity War) the last act alone is worth the price of admission,positive
"I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great but it left me with a feeling that there is something missing....I hated the Clever Hulk, it just negates the whole legacy of the mr jekyll and mr hyde fantasy... PLUS, i was very curious from Infinity war why Hulk didn't want to show up and banner had to use the Iron man suit, it was never even mentioned in Endgame!!The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much of a plot wholes it creates. In the end, there are just too many questions left, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.Also, another the last straw that got me really aggrevated was how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.A MESSAGE for the Producers and the Director; THIS IS A SEQUEL!!! you should have continuity with the previous rational you set in the previous movies!!!I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, it was basically useless in the build up of the story-line, how is she brought in as a convenient without explaining where were she exactly before and why wasn't she trying to stop Thanos earlier (since she was one of the earliest Avengers). Plus, doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre inconsistencies from the writers.So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back.It felt as if it was an essay paper written 2 hours before the deadline!!!",positive
"Visuals, plot, intelligence, emotions, with great acting ....what else do you want in a movie. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have given their best with positive results. The INFINITY SAGA ends.",positive
"Thank you-Marvel for giving me this epic movie,and beautiful memories,but I'm still crying and I'm done with you.
Thank you all those years,and I'll always remember how you break my heart.
And you are destroy everything you built in the past ten years.
You destroy a little girl's dream that she got her first comic book at 12 years old.
Yeah it's a good movie but the worst story.",positive
"I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but from my point of view Infinity War is way better than Endgame. I do feel like Endgame tried to copy some great scenes from Infinity War, yet those ones were miserably executed.
The only thing amazing about Endgame is Captain Marvel and her new short haircut, but that's about all that shines on Endgame :(. I am really disappointed, I really hoped for something better and not that predictable.
Unfortunately Endgame lies in a category of movies for which even the trailer is better than the movie..",negative
The movie was awesome as a fan what we excepted it was more than that .... Too emotional at starting but then fun came ......lots of action and thrill watching this movie ........#AVENGER ASSEMBLE...#don't spoil endgame,positive
"OK so this is the best movie i have ever watchedThe cinema experience wasnt as good becase it was filled up with people and i didnt get any food
also i was the first in my class so i had the power to spoil it (this was only to the person who spoiled infinity war)anyway so this movie was just mind blowing.Black widows death was the most shocking thing in this movie, I really liked how they traveled back in time to past MCU movies. when all the fallen heroes came out of the portals to fight thanos was truly spectacular and it wasnt shocking but still sad that the fact that Iron man died and snapped his fingers. Captain Marvels entrance in the final battle was brilliant. I was kind of suprised that Captain America didnt die but went back in time to live with Peggy.Oh how nice.so this movie felt like the end of the MCU but it really isnt...its just the begining :)",positive
"Infinity War and Endgame are fantastic back to back, they perfectly blend with each other and it is a 2 part story told perfectly. Hawkeye in this film is amazing, he knows he has done wrong and wants to sacrifice himself. Tony and Peter's relationship is great aswell. But the best friendship in this movie is between Tony and Steve, the two share the most screen time and it is the finale to both of their stories. The 2nd last film in the MCU so far, is the best.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame, right off the bat, throws its audiences for a loop with some very unpredictable twists that make you question what will happen for the rest of the movie. The first half of the movie felt fairly disappointing considering what I was expecting and, at times, had a more comedic tone that felt off and unnatural. The disappointing aspects of the first half are entirely made up for and more with the second half. The second half is truly EPIC. The second half might be some of the greatest sci-fi and action ever to be made. The way it ends is completely heartbreaking, but yet sweet. The way the movie pays tribute to the previous movies in this universe is spectacular. One last thing to mention, the first part of the credits is so beautifully designed. It might seem like a weird thing to praise, but it is great.",positive
"SPOILERS PEOPLE DUH.Time travel makes everything confusing and full of what maybe plot holes or not, but with this film touching bases with all the movies leading up to it, it has been well planned and excitingly executed.3 hours is a lot of movie to talk about. It's full of reunions, laughs and tears. These are imperfect heroes doing what they can to save the universe and the time flies by after a necessary somber beginning.I am a cynic and the film and story aren't perfect but it's very entertaining and a satisfying endAvengers assemble!",positive
"No spoilers.
I have watched every movie in the MCU and Avengers:Endgame is such a great movie to top off all these characters fighting for Earth and the universe. The Russo's have made a solid story, merged so many tales and lives and brought these characters from the pages of a comic book into breathing, feeling life.
Thank you for such a great culmination of so many twists and turns.",positive
"I'll start by saying I couldn't wait for this. I've been watching and rewatching in the interim since infinity war. I think the whole reason I was enthralled to begin with was that the story telling aspect of each movie was really good. They focused on enough details to make things believable and make sense, for the most part, chronologically.As a stand alone movie, this was petty good. It was made better having seen all the previous movies.But then it starts to fall apart. It's like they rushed it. Dont get me wrong, they took their sweet time between movies- which was hopefully spent editing just right. But ultimately, it felt too pieced together. Major plot holes were: cap marvel not being involved in the whole thing except beginning and end, Loki stealing the tesseract mid movie and then ?, and cap single handledly returning all the stones without issue, only to age out to be sitting on the bench at just the right time, and marvel finding stark adrift randomly. Last, at least to me, having nebula be the crux of the conflict just felt wrong. I get there had to be a tie in but, using her as though she's connected to the ""cloud"" to force it together just feels wrong.Producers and writers are all super dedicated, so I can't fault them here. Seems like the studios intervened to make certain things happen or cut certain elements that were undoubtedly planned but ultimately edited.I do, and always will love the series and the heroes. The culmination of the stark story arc was so right and so terribly emotional. I half expected hulk to scream at the end there like in avengers, and he'd wake up and ask for a cheeseburger.If you're looking for a way to tie up all the story arcs, this fell short in my opinion. What did I expect though- you can't have this a story this complex tied up nicely. I would've preferred they broke end game into two and taken their time with it. But then you have to consider the actors probably want out by now. I just wish the arcs were tied up a little cleaner. Or at least, they publish a follow up book or a comic or something to tie up the loose ends. The only last piece I can hope for is a directors cut, hopefully somewhere along the 4 hour mark in length, that does a better job. Again, realize you can't make a 4 hour movie for the masses- everyone would belly moan about having to sit that long. But, they very well could have a LOTR - style release in the future, where those of us who are truly invested in the story lines have our long awaited closure.RDJ did this franchise, and his character, so well, I can't begin to describe. I literally cried. RIP man (stark). You the real mvp.",positive

"I've waited a whole year for this. Actually, it's more like 11 years.
Look, I'm a self-professed fanboy who grew up reading comic books as a kid. I absolutely LOVE how Kevin Feige, the actors and the whole Marvel/Disney company have been able to bring some of my childhood heroes to life.
When they first released the Ironman trailer, I was overjoyed because the Ironman flying sequences looked AWESOME & RDJ WAS Tony Stark personified. Then the absolute childish joy of Samuel L Jackson's the Ultimates Nick Fury post credits - Boom! I dared to dream they would go all out with other heroes, and team-ups and cross-overs - the whole nine yards. And they did.
The sheer scope of coordinating such a huge undertaking; the various directorial visions while maintaining a common thread; the writers talents to compress dialogue to it's shortest version while still making sense and actors to deliver those lines believably. The artistry of all those thousands of top level professionals blows me away.
In a way, I'm glad it's over. I've turned the last page, and I'm satisfied. I have closure. If you've been along for the whole ride, or just a part, you owe it to yourself too.",positive
"Amazing, best film yet to bring all 21 previous films to a conclusion! And brie larsons horrible acting was cut super short!!!!! Seriously though it was an emotional rollercoaster with laughs, gasps, cheers, and tears. Must see best way to conclude a series.",positive
"I can't think of any better they could have ended this phase of the MCU. I can only think of a few minor issues with this movie, and if they weren't present, then you have a perfect movie laddies and gentlemen!From the marvellous performances, to the amazing story, this film just sines in creating an amazing superhero saga. I would say all of the original Avengers gave their best performances yet, which enabled the film to feel more tense, more thrilling and more emotional.The film however, played out how I was expecting to be honest, yet, still managed to throw many surprises in there, which I think the first act needed, otherwise It could have turned tediously long. But once all that's over, you have a incredible final act to throw yourself into. I have never felt so driven for the hero's to succeed before in a movie, especially through Captain America (who isn't one of my all time favourites) Thor and Iron man, who all felt like complete bad asses in the third act of the movie.Nothing else to say...go see it, enjoy it, I think we all deserved it!!!",positive
"Avengers endgame is the culmination of over 10 years of film making, dozens of heroes, hundreds of characters supporting characters and a huge huge story that will likely continue for decades to come. this conclusion had a monumental amount of pressure to deliver a satisfying end to the first 22 films in marvel's cinematic universe. and it did.the film continues almost exactly where infinity war left off but opens from the point of view of hawkeye as he's chilling with his family at the moment thanos snaps his fingers. and as you can imagine, things dont go very well from his point of view.the first half of endgame maintains the slow steady pace of the opening scene, with a few brief moments of action as our heroes try to figure out a way to correct what thanos has done to the universe. eventually, with the help of scott lang aka ant man (who finds himself 5 years in the future having been expelled from the quantum realm with a little help from a passing rat), bruce banner and tony stark's minds, they come up with a clever plan to snatch the infinity stones from the past, use them to bring everyone back in the present, and then return them as if they were never gone. rounding up all the heroes is paced very nicely and every scene featuring thor is comedy gold. once everyone is together they are assigned their points and locations in time and we get some very clever scenes with some characters running into their former selves or relatives at points we saw in previous movies. the storytelling here really is top notch.the final act is nothing short of spectacular as virtually every hero from all the films so far is on the battlefield at the same time, with one character cleverly stating ""is that everyone?"" before they charge thanos and his army.i have very few complaints with the film. one of which is that with a film this huge it was impossible to really make the final battle as satisfying as it needed to be. there was just SO much going on that the camera had to shift focus every second from one hero fighting to another and you'll find yourself wanting to see more of whats going on in one place. everyone viewing this film will want to see a little more of their favourite hero fighting their own battle. for me it was spider-man and although i was happy to see him get some screentime fighting with the iron spider suit, i wanted more of that.my other minor issue was that i felt the female heroes scene was super forced and cringeworthy. another example of the desperate need and clear pressure on filmmakers lately to satisfy the needs of the politically correct crowd. we get it, there are female heroes too. yes they are valued just as much as the male ones. but did we really need a shot of them all coming together around captain marvel as if they all finished fighting whatever they were at the exact same moment for a glory shot of female empowerment? it was bad enough in the captain marvel trailer with the play on words around ""her"" and ""hero"" .. i just felt like this shot was completely forced and unnecassary.my final little nitpick (and this is really a personal one) was with the passing of the cap shield. i know that in the comic, steve does at some point pass the shield to falcon, but i was really expecting him to pass it on to bucky. it didnt make sense to me him passing it on to sam as sam is already recognised as falcon. bucky would have made more sense as the next cap in my eyes. but i loved the way they wrote chris evans out of the mcu by him simply staying in the past and growing old with peggy. that was fitting, beautiful and perfect.all in all the film satisfies virtually everything you would expect it to. if you're invested in these characters in any way over the years you'll love the conclusion to phase 4 of the mcu.9/10",positive
"If you have even just a passing interest in superhero/sci-fi/fantasy films, then there is absolutely no excuse for not seeing this film. If you go, ""well superhero films are for kids/nerds/menchildren"" then poor old you, you'll miss out on what is, my humble opinion, one of the greatest fantasy films I've ever seen.
Endgame is perfect. It ties up up all the loose ends from the last ten years of Marvel films and leaves nothing, NOTHING, unfinished or left untouched.
There are moments, huge moments, that leave you breathless, hopeless and high as a kite. 10 years of slow burn and build up and then bam...
This is how you do superhero ensemble films. You build up slowly, you take your time and once you're ready, you make a film that is the sum of all its parts.
Marvel has made some truly epic superhero films, the pressure has always been to make film that brings it all together and does it justice. DC/Warner failed abysmally with Justice League, a film that should blown us away but instead just blew up. Endgame does absolute justice to ten years of intricate planning and forward thinking. It takes you on a thrill ride that takes 3 hours and makes it seem like 30 minutes.
Oh, and see it at a cinema first, you have to see it at the cinema. It's just too good to see it on anything else first...",positive
"This is the real movie !
The real marvel !
The real avengers !
This is the real meaning of sacrifice !
Everything in this movie gives you the feeling that you have to do something and you should do this. If you don't , everything will be destroyed !
You know if you wanna win this game you need to end it ; but with your real hero that sleep inside you for long time.We are in the End game now ...",positive
"Most fans expected that ""Avengers: Endgame"" will resort to time travel to make everything right. It is the same idea of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"".Three moments made ""Avengers: Endgame"" terrific but not a masterpiece, the 1st one is killing Thanos by Thor at the beginning, 2nd one is the sacrifice of Black Widow, and the last one is the death of Iron Man, actually these three unexpected moments shocked all Avengers fans.I have also some negative comments starting with the purpose of Captain Marvel in Endgame!! Actually the only role for her is saving Iron man from a lonely death in space!! The other thing is the final battle, in my humble opinion, it was chaotic as same as White Walker battle in Game of Thrones, also the time travel was a bit hasty and unconvinced, especially in the way of retrieving the infinity stones.Anyway, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is the final movie in the Avengers series, and its ending is a good way to say goodbye.",positive
"Because this movie puts everything on its ear. It's a love letter to ten years for all the fans; it's funny, it's sad, it's family, it's sacrifice, it is everything a superhero team film can ever be.
There will never EVER be a film like this made ever again. Not this good. Not this memorable. And not this powerful.
It is a culmination of many moving parts that finally work as a perfect clock. And it took over a decade to pull it off.
You will be moved. You will cheer. And so help you if you don't even tear up.
We. ARE. Groot.",positive
"Okay - right from the start, this movie had a heavy assignment; To undo all of the drama that made its predecessor IW so great, for one, and to give the three main characters - Iron Man, Cap America and Thor, and, to a lesser degree, the Hulk - a suitable farewell. That a full two strikes.But, also, there were to be hope in the form of new elements out of the rich world that's been created three phases ago. And there was the be the distopic vision of a universe after ""the Snap"". There were some lost opportunities there.Apart from some comment by Cap about some whales near the Potomac, there was no real polemic as if the world was, ecologically speaking, better off in some domains. Nah, it was just bad. And yet Thanos' theory holds water; we are way too much on this planet and are stretching its ressources thin.As for the new hopes for future Marvel movie, it certainly ain't Cap Marvel who will do the trick. Falcon as the new Cap America? Big shoes to fill. Looks definitely like the end of an era.And there are the things we didn't see in that movie, like the Hulk's revenge, or a good fight from Thor, or the Scarlet Witch's wrath, etc. I understand that time travel, which everyone expected, was un-avoidable to bring back about half of the Marvel franchise, but could we have dispensed with so much haste? People wouldn't have complained if two movies has been made instead of one. It felt rushed, and many characters had a but a too brief apparition for farewell.And yeah, Thanos was reduced to an level end's action-figure baddie. And yeah there was too much spotlight on Hawkeye, again. But we also got what I consider Stan Lee's best cameo. May he rest in peace.""End Game"" should be viewed as an acrobat from which we expected another dazzling trick based on his last performence, which was stellar - but alas he crumbled under the pressure. He didn't quite fell, but clearly the best was behind him.",positive
"I'm extremely disappointed as it didn't have any cheese in the film and the film simply wasn't British enough. Thor and Loki's lovely accents were the only redeeming qualities, the rest was just terrible as i had to sit through 3 entire hours of annoying barely understandable accents with no cheese to get my love balls stirring. Afterwards I had to have several pints of tea to cheer me up, don't waste your money on this Britons.",negative
"Love u three thousand times
This movie is truly an epic masterpiece that gives the audience one hell of a ride. Thank u Marvel Studio. Thank u, Russo brothers.
Still can't believe this is the end of the original members.",positive
"If u ever wonder this is has to go 3 hours? I'll tell you the can not cut any minute out of it. Every plot makes sense and storytelling is smooth, and above all, the process is unpredictable if you haven't been spoiled ofc",positive
"Satisfying. Heartbreaking. Funny. Perfect. The best ""finale"" in the history of finales. You can actually feel your favorite characters coming full circle, redeeming themselves, pushing boundaries, and some even finally accepting and becoming the best version of who they are after a millennium of trying to be who they're supposed to be. Excellent callbacks, the one liners are brilliant. Great cameos. You'll laugh through your tears, you'll get chills.Even if someone spoiled the big parts for you, you won't see it coming, not actually. This is an experience of a lifetime.",positive

Overall Endgame was a solid movie. The first hour of the film may seem a little sluggish but the action and story telling makes up for it. The ending and fight scenes were amazing. Overall good film u recommend watching a couple times in theater and adding to your home video collection.,positive
"Awesome movie.. a special treat to the marvel fans by the Russo bros. really liked the movie, a must watch movie for every marvel fan out there. Its really the ENDGAME, a nice and sad ending of the infinity saga.",positive
"It's not one of the best movies in The Avengers series, but it's appreciable. The movie is a bit slow and has less action than the previous ones. One thing I noticed is that the right leftist thinking has come to Marvel once and for all. I imagine the next movies will be based on such an ideology. The presence of Captain Marvel and her attitudes in the plot is proof of this.",positive
"Quite good, great effects (as expected). It was interesting to see Avengers beaten, broken, a nice phoenix arc.
Only downsides are Captain Marvel (damn, that actress is wooden) and one cringy feminist scene, thankfully a very short one.
Since many of the best are out/dead (or promised to NOT have a series/movie like Scarlet Witch), I don't think following products will be worth watching. If you are really invested, I would recommend waiting for proper reviews for a few weeks (just ignore ""professional"" critics), or buy it at significant discount later.",positive
"Like much of other series , avengers gets worse with the end. Honestly, to my opinion not worth to go to cinema. Infinity wars was much better. I was expecting a great ending, not this.",positive

"I love everything about this movie.
good job for all of people who help making this a masterpice.",positive
"We got everything we wanted and more. Great storytelling, great effects, simply a rollercoaster of feelings ... i knew i should brought tissues ... but I didn't.",positive
"Infinity war perfectly meshed the missing components in terms of adding the missing members of the avengers such as the guardians of the galaxy as well as the new MCU addition Spiderman as well as introducing us to Thanos wth a lot of backstory masterfully executed. It saddened and frustrated how it ended but in hindsight set the stage perfectly for endgame which got the creative juices really going with very high expectation set by its predecessor. Unfortunately it got wasted with the Russo brother pulling continuously at the string of the worlds smallest violin turning what should have been a magnificent superhero movie into a nonstop tear jerker. Though I can appreciate the underlying theme of this movie is about dealing with loss and being triumphant at the end.. It seems the former is continuously stuffed down peoples throat for at least two hours.As a poster ealier pointed out its 2 hours of crying, some action and crying again. The climax of the movie was enjoyable though it didn't cover screen time as much as it should have when it was the main reason people came to watch the movie. Theres a lot of things that happen to the movie which either don't make much sense, either happen to quick or just illustrate lazy writing assuming the viewer will fill in the gaps with a lot of cheesy content which gets you thinking 'really'. It almost seems as though they had put thought into how they wanted the story to end but didn't put much creative thought to the journey leading to the climax as simply cobbled whatever they may have left out of the MCU in the previous movies into this for fan service. As an MCU fan I would still advise people to view it as its end of this saga but don't believe a lot of the hype that's on this review board or you will be immensely disappointed.",positive
"This was definitely a movie that I'll have in the back of my mind for a while! I saw this movie last night, and I'm still in a state of shock and awe. The last 40 minutes of the movie was an emotional rollercoaster!",positive
"I really tried to be objective here, and there is way too much to say then what I have written below. I like many of these Marvel films, but 3/4 Avenger movies has been way below average. People that said this is the best movie ever, comparing it to all time greats, you got to be kidding me, right? A new gen movie obviously, People really need to sit down and watch some classics for heaven sakes! After all the comics, this one made was the biggest failure of them all. The ol' Sayin don't quit your day job applies here. The film fails in so many ways. Where to begin. Start with a fat Thor, about as stupid as it comes. Hands the kingship over to a Valkyrie? Give me a break. Where was his power? He was as weak as hawk eye. There not all equal. Thanos would not have been able to stop the Cap. America with the hammer and Thor with the axe at the same time, impossible. Cmon Hollywood. Total nightmare movie garbage. Too many characters, way too much blah here. This was a typical sexual/racist/political movie of all the nowaday stereo types. It's like you couldn't make it more obvious. Nice try to slam Trump's 2016 win with Tony Stark's liberal comments in beginning of movie, it was a spin. H-wood must think we're stupid that we don't pick these things up. How about the sob comments by capt america? Was that even needed? Surprise they just don't use the f word constantly in these pg13 movies. Where was the hulk man? The cartoon movie was way better then this nonsense. So many loop holes. I still see no reason why Dr. Strange had to give up the space stone. Maybe he was in cohorts with Thanos. That would have been better then just handing it over. Time travel? Ok but, anytime you go in the past you have already impacted the future. Just by someone seeing you has already made a changes = the future is messed up. What would have been better is to have gone back and talking to your former self like in Batman vs Superman and give yourself a warning. Even with that it still would have a impact. But even if you follow the that plot they did, where was Loki after the Teserak grab? They missed a huge opportunity for his come back surprise moment. Who writes this crap? I'm Tired of these slap um together blah script movies with so many flaws. Cmon Robert Downey Jr, even you could have done this better. That's how you wanted to go out? Iron man 1&2 so way better then these. This is exactly why they need to keep super hero's to there own story line. Best movie of these series is Iron Man 1, Dr. Strange, Thor Ragarnok, CivilWar, Iron man 2, Thor 1, Avengers 1, maybe Capt. Marvel and winter soldier. Everything else is a F, and it was just like putting slop on your plate, military style.",positive
Went into movie theater expecting an epic finale and a much better movie than infinity war; alas it was so anti climatic so boring so full of plot holes an elephant would've passed through them - or a hulk for that matter - very disappointing movie overall!!!,negative
"I have know idea what to say about this epic movie. Going in I've never seen a movie in IMAX before. That was unbelievable to see and watch. All I can say without giving any spoilers. This movie is entertaining, epic, fun, and incredible. This movie didn't feel like a 3 hour movie. All I can say this movie was jaw dropping, epic movie. Like I said on Twitter. I haven't seen a movie like this in a long time. My rating is 10/10. Probably go see it again soon. Go see this in IMAX it's worth the money. #avengersendgame #imax #ironman #captainamerica #thor #rocketraccoon #hulk #blackwidow #avengersassemble",positive
"Yes this review contains spoilers and theories, as well as my review on this epic film!So for starters, I saw the film on Sunday during it's opening weekend and I wanted to stay on social media and refused to click any link about Endgame as I did not want any spoilers, but after seeing it, all I want to do it talk about it, share idea and theories, and quote some of the best one liners in cinematic history.So, yes I gave this film a 10/10 and I would rate it higher if given the possibility. The story was amazing, and the trailer even though it told us about the Quantum Realm and that was going to be the focus of the film; the Russo brothers added many twists and definitely unforseen endings to our beloved superheroes.The one thing everybody was bashing the movie for was the end credits, or lack there of... However, Marvel end credits usually have been added as little last minute jokes and laughs, or leading into the next film. However, this film marks the end of Phase 3, so there is nothing to lead into and the film was over 3 hours long, so do you really need a little 15 second segment showing the group eating Shawarma?One ending that wasn't addressed and makes sense with the announcement of it's release on Disney+ was the disappearance of Loki after Tony, Steve, and Bruce travel back to 2012 to retrieve the Tesseract. However, after the foiled attempt, Loki manages to escape with the Tesseract. However, the group travels further in time to retrieve the Tesseract from the facility where Captain America was created. So my question is, if they retrieved the Tesseract earlier than 2012, does that mean the one Loki has is gone? Or did it create a ripple in the timeline as the Ancient One explained to Professor Hulk. I guess we will have to wait for that theory when Loki gets his show when Disney+ premieres.And finally, the end credits didn't have any videos but there was an audio snippet of what sounded like metal clashing on metal, almost like a forge or blacksmithing. So, many people are speculating that this is Iron Man making his Mach.1 suit in the cave. Kind of like a statement, ending where it began.But my theory is it's Eitri... The Giant Dwarf of Nidavellir. I believe it is him forging a weapon which would lead us into GotG: vol.3, which is why Marvel was so set of getting James Gunn back to direct as he had the plot and the story already wrote before his firing and while Endgame was being produced. At the end of GotG: vol.2 we get introduced to Adam Warlock, who, James Gunn, said wouldn't appear in Endgame, but his presence will be known in the MCU... Next major villian perhaps? Could he be forcing Eitri to make him a weapon more powerful than the Infinity Gauntlet? Perhaps not to harness all the stones, but perhaps to harness just one (Soul Stone, which he aquires in the comics after obtaining the Infinity Gauntlet) but make it even more powerful? The soul stone was barely used in Infinity War and Endgame, but it's considered the most powerful stone, so creating a villian that showcased such power might bring the Orange gem justice.That's my review and my theories.
Thanks",positive
"Endgame. And it is. The arc that started 11 years ago comes to a crashing finale and satisfies what I was hoping to be a gratifying ending to what is being called the Infinity Saga. After a surprising and quick paced beginning, we go into story building mode for a little over an hour, which is needed for the action to start and the build up to be worth it. I am right now debating on whether to put spoilers in, or go light review.
Well, if you don't want minor spoilers, stop right here.
The original team that started the Super Group movement every studio is trying to capture is getting a facelift. Old faces are moving on/out and surprising additions to others are coming. Thanos is still an imposing figure in the movie, just not the same one as you see in Infinity War. They tie loose ends up nicely with the characters we have loved for (me) decades. I'm sad to see these characters story come to a conclusion. But on the bright side, we have more movies of these characters than many other icons get, so I can always start at Ironman and divulge myself for a wopping 23 movies over and over if the coming movies fail to live up to what has been a superb run.",positive
"I have seen a lot and I mean A LOT of movies and nothing beats this movie !!! Holy hell !! I mean just absolutely loved this movie !! The movie just is flawless ! It had me at the edge of my seat, had me crying like a baby (non spoiler), the acting from everyone was absolutely flawless and Josh Brolin as Thanos was AMAZING !!! THIS MOVIE DESERVES 100000 STARS !!!! I know it's my opinion but anyone who thinks this movie was not at least good just wants to be famous for trolling cause this movie is beautiful !!!",positive
"Didn't feel like the right time to introduce captain marvel. an extraordinarily powerful character who is absent for most of the movie when the stakes are highest. just doesn't make sense,to me it would have been a better change over to the next MCU phase if the character was introduced in the end credits like she was in infinity war.apart from that the film carried its weight and was very faithful to the arcs of the original 6 avengers. the ending was satisfying and neatly ties up this phase of MCU.not as good as infinity war but its always hard to get the final movie/episode right. endwar is to infinity war is as ROTJ is to ESB.",positive
"People are silly when they say they dont like it. There is admittedly a lot to unpack here. I personally am going to have to watch it at least two more times to catch everything. But I loved it, it was a sincere practical ending. I'm glad it went down this way",positive
"The hype when I leave the cinema was great, this because was really a good film, with nice scenes that all the fans went to see, for example Captain America with Mjolnir, the Scarlet scene or the Thor scene killing Thanos. But the holes in the scripts and the weak parts of the film cannot be ignored, time travel is almost never a good one and is full of mistakes and script holes and that's what happened in this film. In addition, the expectation was very high, especially when it comes to closing a franchise as big as this one and ended up being well below.",positive
"As the ending of such a wonderful saga, Endgame surely is breathtaking and magnificent. The storyline flows and the timeline all well made, the acting performance is awesome, and though it's also heartbreaking not give you what you want, but it give you what you need. It's like the journey of life, where the ride bring you up and down, tears and joys, laugh and cries, but it the end, you get what you need. Not always what you want, but what you need.",positive
"After Infinity War you expect smth special and brain-blowing to end the story. But this is a typical Marvel ""fight-explode-green background"" film. And this stupid/hilarious explanation for time travelling while hipocritically laughing at other time-travelling films.",positive
"Unlike Infinity War, Endgame was there for only fan service, which is not something one should look for in a movie.",negative
The best movie I have ever seen. Refrain from spoilers because the experience is unlike any other,positive
"See it in IMAX! Or see it in the biggest, loudest auditorium your community has! It's ten times over worth the price of admission. Thank you Marvel for entertaining us for over a decade and respecting our emotional investment in these stories! Woot!",positive
"Usually the phrase came full circle is used way to often without meaning but in the sense of Avengers: Endgame Marvel did just that, wrapping up 10 years of storytelling and movies all really well. This movie is really once in a lifetime and there will never be another movie like this one.What I really enjoyed about this movie is that it really took its time with the plot and when the action came it really delivered on all fronts. Sometimes it took too long to get going especially with a 3 hour run time but it was never boring and you just kept getting intrigued with the story elements. When the movie starts it's right off Infinity War and did really well to establish the consequences of the last movie and to let the characters experience the fallout of Infinity War and that was really interesting.As I said the movie really took its time with it plot sometimes it just felt a little too dragged on as it left the directors wanted to over-establish some plot points instead of just keeping it simple but I wouldn't say it's a major issue it's just that in a 3 hour runtime you don't need to over complicate the plot. However though the story was really fantastic, if I haven't said it before the Russo Brothers are geniuses they managed to wrap up 10 years worth of storytelling in one movie brilliantly from the First IronMan movie till now. They really cared for each character and managed to create resolutions for almost every single one again well done Russo's.Speaking of characters, obliviously there were a lot characters like Infinity War but Endgame was really about the conclusion of the original six Avengers from IronMan, Black Widow, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Thor. Each one had an arc and came to satisfying conclusions by the end of the movie. The really surprising performance came from Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye or Ronin who we didn't see on Infinity War and had a really nice story that involved him and his family and the events of Infinity War and how it impacted him. Robert Downey Jr gave the best performance as usual ,Nebula,Ant-Man and Black Widow we're also good in this movie and had one of the more interesting plots of the movie. Captain Marvel was fine. Chemistry between gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr was good as always. In all honesty no one gave a bad performance in this movie they all did really well so that's another plus.Now Thanos played by Josh Brolin who had a very big role in Infinity War and was a fantastic villain and was one of the best if not the best thing about Infinity War played a small role in Endgame, I mean he was still Thanos he was badass, menacing and obviously had some memorable lines. He wasn't in the movie all that much except for in the beginning and largely shows up at the end of the movie for the final showdown and that was kinda disappointing, but with the story the Russos went for you could understand why he wasn't in it that much but still it was kind of disappointing. Thanos was still a great villain in Endgame all that being said and you could fell The after effects he imposed after Infinity War. Without saying too much Thor and Hulk were the twist characters in this movie I mean they did some surprising stuff with them at first I was like Marvel what did you do but in the case of Hulk it turned out all right but Thor...lets just say I didn't like what they did to him or his arc(if that's what you wanna call it) was disappointing it's like they used hot laughs.The humor was good for the most part of course this is a Marvel movie so forced humor played a factor(sorry if you keep seeing this in all my Marvel review but it is what it is) especially in the case of Thor I mean Endgame didn't ruin the character of Thor but it's like they were trying to ruin him if that makes sense. There wasn't really a lot of action in the first and second half of the movie maybe one action scene in the second act to keep things fast paced, in fact there were like 2 or 3 action scenes in the whole movie(I'll talk about the final battle just hold on). I mean that was really surprising that a superhero movie managed to keep me intrigued for that much with so little action so again hats off to the Russo's for a compelling and interesting story. Now let's talk about the final battle, yes it was Epic I usually don't describe anything as Epic but the final battle of Endgame was truly a spectacle and I'm glad I got to see it. It was filled with tense moments, awesome comic book action, drama and truly some wonderful surprises, it had it all that I think the final battle was the best action set piece in all of Superhero movie history just truly phenomenal action.The tone of this movie was lighter than I expected after the events of Infinity War I mean it's not a bad thing, when the movie got dark and serious you felt it. Endgame was part adventure so I guess you'd expect some lighter tones in some aspect but the tone was really well balanced for the most part. The third act was really the best part of the whole movie and I mean the whole last act, there were some nail biting moments, epic action and wonderful storytelling and heart breaking scenes. Without saying too much Endgame delt with Time and some people are already saying that caused major plot holes in the movie and unanswered question were left but for me I didn't mind cause I enjoyed what the did and it came up with some heart warming moments with characters like Thor,Tony Stark and Captain America so I really don't care if there were plot holes or not caused what I saw on screen was wonderful.So Avengers: Endgame was a really great movie, had awesome characters, an intriguing story, it was fun, had funny humor, fantastic action, really heartbreaking moments and a satisfying conclusion.Sure there were a few things a didn't like for instance some baffling character decisions or some dragged on scenes but for the most part all I have to say in a nutshell, Thank You Marvel.",positive

Marvel Studios managed to wrap up eleven years in this beautiful, heartfelt, emotional, funny, and action packed film. It is a kiss on the forehead to every MCU fan. I felt so happy and joyful while watching this. Clap, cheer, be openly happy while watching this, I can guarantee that it will add to the experience. Please, go watch this movie and bask in its glory!",positive
"The movie wraps up the series nicely, but as with many finales the movie doesn't really stand in it's own until half way through.The first half is wrapping up all that happened before, and a lot has happened to so many different strong and complex characters. The hour and a half it takes to reach the real 'end game' feels both a bit shallow, and slow.All in all, the movie does what it promises, end the series, but for those who are not die hard fans, might find the end result a bit uninspired and dutiful.",positive
"Avengers Infinity wars and Endgame might very well have been one movie and therefore could have saved me a ticket to the movie theater for the second time round. It wasn't necessary for it to be divided into two parts, hell it wasn't necessary for Endgame to be almost 3 hours long considering the flimsy plot!After I saw infinity wars, I already had a suspicion I was cheated, and Endgame proved that I was right. This entire movie was trying to drag for so long and even the quasi emotional scenes just didnt do it for me. I felt nothing when Black Widow jumped to her death, which was one of the few parts of this movie that actually made sense, sacrificing someone dear to get the soulstone.But what it came down to is the cliched classic jump back in time travel plot, however it wasn't supposed to be like Back in the Future, so they say. But Captain America came back in the same time-line as an old man, so how is that not like Back in the Future?!?Also Captain Marvel was totally hyped, but didn't played much of a role in the entire movie, talk about overhyping it!You see I have been cheated.....and all of you aswell.",negative
I can't describe how many emotions went through me during the movie. It was just amazing portrait of what an complex movie should look like :) It was an experience for whole life,positive
21 movies to a perfect ending :) wow had it all. Slow start building the film up with an immense hour towards the end of none stop action adrenaline. Amazing sequence of films I don't know how it can be continued from here really. SPOILER ALERT wow we thought thanos was dead but the way he was introduced back into the film was perfectly executed and gave us the end battles we all deserved absolutely epic beyond words.3 hours long and worth every minute,positive
This movie is AMAZING! Perfect conclusion to the MCU. I'm one of those people who doesn't give a 10 unless I believe the movie is perfect. I believe that it is impossible to make a perfect movie but this movie challenged that belief.,positive

But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was!

"Please don't waste your time with this one. This movie was the worst, most cringeworthy waste of a good story I have ever seen.",negative
"No doubts about this one. Graphics, script, anticipation all make this movie the best super hero movie of all time. Every character you could ever love and more is involved in some way. It's a closure on a chapter in cinematic history we've never seen before. 11 years 23 movies all built up to this point and it didn't disappoint.All of the speculation on how this movie would play out. Though I'm quite sure anyone guess was right. Marvel stuck somewhat to form with the comics but as always went their own route too. The movie has plenty of twist and turns and laughter to go along. If you've been a fan of this series since it's inception with Iron man. You won't leave disappointed but you may not leave happy either. I could not recommend a movie more to go to the theatre and see.I think this movie is in a group of its own. And hopefully will be rewarded come awards time. Every aspect in my opinion was just fantastic. I can't think of anything really that didn't make this movie perfect. I applaud the directors, screen writers, actors, actresses and everyone that's involved. I'll end up my non spoiler with this....I love you 3000...with tears in my eyes.",positive
The movie is just amazing and justice was done to infinity war..But don't read too much reviews and over expect.. I heard about so many crying scenes.. And the movie was over and I was waiting for more... Expect less and enjoy the master piece!End of this era!,positive
"I decided to give this a 10/10 because it was a real movie going experience. A lot of people prefer Infinity War and I know why, it's because it follows the same generic mode of story telling as all the other generic Marvel movies, the Captain America and Antman movies were a slight step up in my opinion but that may be because I liked the leads on those movies.In fact Paul Rudd was the stand out for me and I identified with him most of the movie, it was very funny yet remained serious gripping me in my seat akin to The Matrix or Inception.I actually liked Tony Stark in this which is funny because I have never been a fan of RDJ portrayal of that character, yet he managed to do what the script required and well.Thor's comedy was good but felt out of place in parts given the gravity of the situation. Also Hulks new form felt silly aswell as I prefer the smart Bruce Banner and angry Hulk over the Bronx style 'I'm walking here' amalgamation we got in this film.Clint Barton and Black Widow we're both superb as usual and a movie for both or either of them would be great ;)Captain Marvel was awful and she didn't feel natural at all or even really needed, the feminism rang strong when she got every single female character on the battlefield together with no man In site to get the gauntlet to where it needed to be. Where did all the men go?The end was both sad and fulfilling and the score was survivable as we would expect fro Alan Silverstri where we could really notice some of his themes",positive
"This was amazing. The acting was incredible and most of the cgi was good. The character development was great especially tony stark.
Spoiler alertThe way they played on tony dying at the start was great and nebula. They completely made thanos much more mature and mad. Time travel is so good and better than other time travel movies (maybe back to the future; I like that movie anyway). And how they ended Tony's arc from the start to finish was good. His death was sad but he will live on. And cap was fantastic. I can't say much more because what's already been said about this movie just go see it
Conclusion.This film was great and perfect ending.",positive
Avengers endgame is the perfect conclusion for 10 years of history,positive
"First of it's awesome! Great and well deserved ending to the storyline of Ironman, not forgetting Captain America.
Can't help but a quote from The Matrix pops in my mind: ""everything that has a beginning has an end"". It's just perfect ending.
There are a bunch flaws and logical hiccups in there which kind of take away the sweetness of the film. The time ravel just brings in too many variables and questionable decisions from the characters. There would've been other much easier and more logical ways to stop Thanos. Simply only go back in time to Titan where Ironman and crew fought Thanos alone without his army, bring Captain Marvel along and you already won the war before the snap.
Other problem with time travel is that now you can bring back almost every hero from the past if you need them for a fight to the present and after it simply bring them back to the past. Which means from this point on even the greatest threat in the universe can be solved easily by bringing the needed hero from the past along.
There's also the thing with the hierarchy. Thor with the Stormbreaker was already stronger than Thanos in Infinity War, but now isn't even a competition for Thanos without the Infinity Gauntlet. Captain Marvel also seems much more powerful than Thanos even with the Infinity Gauntlet. Scarlet Witch also is already tearing Thanos apart when she gets blasted away.
Than again the mad titan looks more unbeatable in the fight against the tag team of Cap and Thor with his blade than he was with the infinity Gauntlet in the previous film.
Professor Hulk on the other hand is a great idea brings a lot of funny moments to the film, absolutely loved him!
That being sad I still think it's an awesome movie but there always is a but...",positive
"When Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man"" came out in 2008 with a witty Robert Downey Jr. as the lead man, I don't think even Marvel had such great expectations, yet in a bit over a decade, the so-called MCU became the trademark when it comes to blockbusters and ""Avengers: Endgame"", directed by the Russo brothers (Anthony and Joe), is their ""destiny fulfilled"".So, just in the absurd case you are a Marvel fan and have second thoughts whether you should spend your money on this, then the answer is simple--yes. This film ticks every single box when it comes to properly concluding the ""lore"" of the MCU and then some! It is the ultimate wet dream for any comic-book fan, a complete, satisfying sphere of everything for everyone whose focus on entertainment is centered on all things Marvel.Predictably, this film has no time for itself. Think about it, this is the culmination of 22 other works, its primary purpose being to put in order over a decade of cliffhangers, loose ends and post-credit scenes. It is condemned to carry a great burden, something that no film should do, and it carries it perfectly even if that means sacrificing its own identity. Viewing this from the point of an impartial person, stripping down all its dependencies, you get nothing more than a textbook executed blockbuster.This is not necessarily a bad thing right now, as technology isn't impacting enough to tear down the core of the art of cinema (3D, happily, does not ruin it). Yet as I watched the ending, I could not help but feel this was the end of an era not only for Marvel, but for blockbusters as well. This is, after all, the blockbuster's final form as of now making this an essential viewing despite being far from a masterpiece.""Avengers: Endgame"" might not be much more than a meta-film, like the glove whose only purpose is to be a vessel for the infinity stones, but at least it is one whose contents consist of sustained excitement, sweet retrospectives and, as usual for any Marvel film, dotted about with their trademark, perfectly timed humor--yes, even here, in the final hour.",positive

There is however a glimmer of hope with the arrival of Captain Marvel (Larson) and some new leads on Thanos (Brolin). So the gang assemble (as you do for one of these big films) and head out ready to finally make Thanos pay and possibly save the victims of his action.Unfortunately, revelations are revealed and everyone is broken even more so than the previous battle. Fast forward 5 years and the world and the universe are vastly different. Our remaining heroes are scattered to the four corners of the universe and people are trying to move on.

I can't go any further without stating that there will be spoilers in this review as I have to discuss some aspects of the plot so be wary going ahead. I will also state though I won't bring anything in that is from the third act of Avengers: Endgame.What did you do!?
Avengers: Endgame is a love letter to fans of both the Marvel comics and the MCU. This means it has all the power of the 21 films behind it. Unfortunately, it also has several of the trappings that have been in each of those films that are amplified by such a major event film.
For example, this film is one part a sequel to Avengers: Infinity War but it is also a continuation of Thor's narrative from Thor: Ragnarok. These two elements do not mix as the choices that the Russo brothers make in regard to Thor are laughable and easily could have been handled better. I can see where they are going with how Thor is handling himself after the events of both Ragnarok and Infinity War but they fumble here and Thor is not the only one who suffers.
Hulk and Captain Marvel are also mishandled in my opinion. Captain Marvel is a plot device not a character in this film. Reports came out recently that Brie Larson filmed this before her solo outing and it shows in how the Russo brothers utilise her. With regard to the Hulk and Bruce, their whole character narrative is fanservice with no real depth to it. It's a shame because I was looking forward to where Hulk and Bruce were going.
On the positive side Captain America (Evans), Iron Man (RDJ) and Black Widow (Johansson) are handled far better. With Cap and Tony, it's again further fan service but with Widow, there is a journey and it's impressive. It's a combination of great acting on Johansson's part and interesting narrative choices. In the end though there are two MVP's in Avengers: Endgame and it's Jeremy Renner and Paul Rudd. Their respective character arcs are emotionally charged and I loved it. They have quiet scenes that bookend the big brawls and it's greatly appreciated.
On the topic of the big brawls there is a fair sense of scope and grandeur. The cinematography is decent and there are several moments of awe-inspiring shots that look ripped straight from the comics. They are splash pages in every meaning of the word.
Avengers Assemble!
There are many moments that fans will cheer over. Moments that will have them in tears clutching their significant other and that is wonderful. I myself cried at multiple points in the film but I am a sucker for these tropes.
I can say hand on my heart I will cry at the end of Supernatural when it comes to its conclusion at the end of season 15 but I know that it's not all been award winning. This is the same fact for Avengers: Endgame.
There are payoffs to many narrative elements for almost every character across the MCU and some of them are great but there are also payoffs that are just jokes and they clash with the tone of what is supposedly an end of an era.
There's even a section in this 3-hour ""epic"" that comes across like a victory lap of sorts. Where the cast seems to be like - Hey remember how great this was? It's unfortunate and it felt like something out of a long-running television series.Whatever it takes
Avengers: Endgame is a tough film to dissect. In one hand I adored the emotional beats, and several of the character arcs were engaging. However, there are so many issues. The clashing of tones, the misrepresentation of characters from this film as opposed to the last film we saw them in.There is no doubt in my mind that Avengers: Endgame is going to make a ton of money that fans will eat it up but it is by no means a perfect film.",positive
"I am a very great fan of Avengers. I did like the film, and watched all Avengers. What I didn't like in this film was the premise. It was very relatable to the other Avengers, but it didn't really make much sense, even if the plot and storyline was obvious. It was obvious, but the storyline was obsolete. Basically out of context and out of date.Nonetheless, I really enjoyed watching, and the overall character animation. not worth watching twice, but definitely a film worth watching. A franchise worth watching.",positive
"Of course it couldnt be as good as Infinity War. And to be fair it could be terrible, wich it isnt. But it is still not great in any way. 1 good joke and just a bunch of revisiting past episodes, thats it. Thats End Game. They sure leaned on tear jerking hard, and it did get me a little with Nebula reaching out. but overall it just shows that going into time travel paradoxes can be funny or stupid. And here it is second one i am afraid. Not a waste of time, but far from Infinity war. They would get so ,much respect if they actually ended it with IW))",negative
I don't wanna say much but walking out of the cinema never felt so heartwarming and conclusive. Thanks Stan Lee and ofc. Robert D. Junior.,positive

But now after watching this film i realized that its ended the saga of avengers is finished.But this movie is the best movie that you will see in your life and its even beyond your expectation .Its ending is going to touch your hearts and i controlled myself not to cry .I wanna thank the cast of avengers,directors,producer,writer for giving the once in a lifetime movie that this generation will ever see.
Love you iron man (Robert)
Love you cap(cris evans)
and finally i want to say this that i did cry after watching this film",positive
"Anything less than 10/10 would be a disgrace to being a critic. I genuinely thank Russo Brother's. Its a perfect movie, all the connections they made with past, every character's strength showcased perfectly on big screen. 20 mins fighting sequence and still they were able to cover up everything, created epic moments, which we fans were thriving for years. So many hidden references, small details e.g. Tony Stark being selfish his entire life finally sacrificed his perfect life and did a selfless act for the greater good and Captain lived selflessly and dedicated his entire life for his country and people his cared about ended up finally living for himself and he deserved it. Afterall he was worthy!
I could go on forever and wouldn't be able to finish praising it. So that's that!",positive
Incredible movie!!! All around amazing!!! A beautiful ending that felt not only like a proper wrap up to everything we have seen in the MCU so far but also opened so many doors for the future. BEST MCU MOVIE!,positive
"Couldn't imagine a better way to finish this saga of 21 movies. It was a slow, emotional, fast, fun movie... all the best ingredients to make it a ten out of ten unforgettable epic movie. Well done, you did a great job! I enjoyed every second and almost dropped a tear at one point:)",positive
"Waited a year for this and it was so worth it. Lived up to expectations but actually was far better than I could have imagined. Absolutely amazing. I cried so much. A beautiful ending to this epic feat of storytelling. Hilarious, dramatic, awe-inspiring and just unbelievable. Go see this movie!!!",positive
Although it's a slow build all the emotional investments count in a film that is more about the characters we've come to love as they work through loss rather than the next battle they'll fight. Each of our original heroes complete their arcs. A fitting end to a mammoth undertaking.,positive
Absolutely outstanding end to the saga. The climactic ending was worth the 3 hour wait.,positive
"To start off, I am not a mcu fan and this review is completely non biased. First of all, the movie is not bad, nor great in my opinion..it's just an overall good film. The first half of the movie for me was very slow and laggy, however it picks up its pace later on. I haven't watched every marvel movie so I didn't really understand a lot of the references that were made so that was another downside for me. The way they handled Thor kind of disappointed me bcuz he is my fav avenger but it's ok bcuz he was kinda funny. The ending is the best part of the movie because the action, goosebump moments, and emotional scenes were done very well.
Overall, I think they could have trimmed a lot of the first half of the movie bcuz 3 hours felt very long when there are a lot of scenes that didn't contribute much to the plot. However, I think mcu fans will definetily enjoy the movie much much more than a neutral like me. It's a good movie, trust me, but not the best. Give it a watch bcuz it won't disappoint you, that's for sure!",positive
"One of the most overrated and overhyped movies of 2019, filed with plot holes, subpar acting, simplistic drama, tensionless fight scenes and a ton of CGI explosions.",negative
Every marvel fan must watch this movie.Those who going for this movie without watching other movies they may get confused while watching this movie.Those who watched all marvel movies they can understand this movie.,positive

"I love the ending for each characters. And only hate Captain Mavel, she tried to act like a ""super man"" who does not care about anyone or anything, and with a mind of teenager, she willing to jump into the enemy without thinking. Great job!
I wish the film does not have her.",positive
"Let me first start by saying that Endgame is a fine and entertaining movie that does the job. However I expected quite a lot more. Infinity War was fresh and unexpected, emotionally powerful movie. Endgame is typical Hollywood. The creators had to please everyone, from the shareholders to the audience and it amounts to a movie that takes a standard approach towards resolving the problem created in the first part.
I think the biggest mistake was the use of time travel as a plot device. It stifles creativity. But I guess there was no easy way to solve the problem of facing an enemy that is basically an omnipotent God. The creators put themselves in a corner, by creating an unbeatable enemy and had to use the cheap trick of time travel. In essence, all-stone Thanos remained unchallenged and unbeaten. I would've preferred a story-line that somehow didn't use time-travel to fix things. Definitely a thankless task for the writers, but this is not science, I think it was still possible. Anyway, with Infinity war for a moment we forgot we're watching a silly superhero movie, but Endgame brought us back to reality.",positive
"MCU have built up to this movie. 22 movies, endless battles, great heroes, enjoyable villains and now we are here.
It was dark, it was funny, it was amazing. I enjoyed it very much but will need to watch it again as there was so much.
Iron Man and Captain America got their Swan songs that they deserved as everyone knows the contracts are up.
The plan worked!",positive
"I didn't like this movie the first time, coming out of the theater pissed as hell. It took a second Imax viewing to really appreciate this film. They had a lot of characters in this film, and it was amazing that they balanced them so well.",positive
"Talk too much in first 2h.
Combat in last 30min is too messy.",positive
Greatest movie ever. Hats off to the creators and the cast. Would recommend everyone one out there to watch it. Has everything nostalgic to sentimental vibes a perfect example of what a new era movie should be. I bet even the toughest men alive will cry watching it. Respect to those who sacrificed themselves in the making of a great legacy.,positive
"The first act of this movie is a mixed bag. It tried to be very serious and emotional but they crack jokes like half the people on earth didn't just die. It leads to a very inconsistent mood, and it isn't helped by the fact that this first act is super boring and uneventful. I wish they would have found a solution other than time travel, but it was fine considering the devastation shown in the last movie, but I wish they spent more time setting up the time travel instead of just figuring it out in a matter of 2 scenes. They wasted a lot of time in the beginning just standing around talking about nothing, being sad and cracking jokes that didn't fit the vibe of the scene, but they skipped right over the whole time travel part. The second act is where the movie picks up. While not perfect, it gave the movie some much needed pacing adjustments. The cutting back and forth between the different groups solving their problems made it a lot less boring than it could have been. But the final act, I don't even know what to say. The final act of this movie was amazing. The fight scene was so epic on so many levels, if the movie was just the last act, it would have been a light 9/10. The first act of this movie is like a 4-5/10, the second act is a decent 7/10, and overall I think the movie is a 7/10. The biggest problems with this movie are the lack of emotional focus, pacing issues, and a clear distinction between the 3 acts. I literally could tell EXACTLY where one act ended and the other one started. Aside from that, I think this movie was very good, I think with a different director or a slightly different script this could have been an 8/10 movie.",positive
"Is the movie entertaning? sure. is the movie good? nope. It's actually one of the weakest mcu movies. maybe even worse than black panther and spiderman. and those 2 were really bad.so basically, a rat saved the day. Not Hulk, not tony stark but a rat. oh, and time travel. it's like they wrote the scenario in 1 day, in rehab.It's a pitty that after Infinity War, which was awesome, we got this dissapointing finale.9 stars? lol.",negative
"Though I am not the biggest fan of Marvel movies, I can say without a doubt that this had the most epic finale in a movie ever. This was not a movie. This was an experience, an event. This was a fantastic end to a decade of generation-defining super hero movies. This was a movie to remember. Also, the credits were very touching (it may be a weird note, but they are great).Though I will say this movie was a little too long, and Thanos felt a little less emotional real than he was in Infinity War. Also, it was very overwhelming in scope for such a long time, I was actually dizzy afterwards.",positive
"I watched it twice and I have to say I found it better the 2nd time. Sure, I could knit pick it apart like the negative Nancy's out there, but my rating is based on how I felt through out and at the end. End Game was a 3 hour roller coaster of emotions and thrills. I left feeling better than I felt after Return of the King. Sad at those lost, but satisfied with how the arch was wrapped up. Perhaps the fight scenes could have lasted longer, perhaps other little things could have been done. I think people are mad mainly because it didn't end the way they wanted. Sometimes great movies take turns we don't like or expect. This one is no exception. All-in-all an epic ending to a 22 movie journey.",positive
"I was in a theatre on first day release of this movie, and I enjoyed each and every single second of this movie, last 30 to 40 minutes was crazy, people were crying, or clapping like idiots, a drop of tear on my chick, when captain said, AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. just love this movie, thank you makers, thank you avengers, and iron man, WE LOVE YOU 3000.",positive
"This movie lives up to the hype, fantastic directing and story telling.This movie lifts some of the most iconic moments in the Marvel Universe straight from the comic page.Roll on the next 11 years of Marvel Magic!",positive
"Just when you thought they may not live up to the hype,
Just when you thought they have already done it all and there's nothing else that's gonna surprise you,
Marvel does it again.
Absolutely the best superhero movie ever!",positive
"I only do movie reviews if I either hate'm or love'm. This was in between, and I'm only reviewing it cuz it was a wrap-up of Stan Lee's Avenger series, where they do a mash-up of many of his super heroes like Iron Man, Thor, etc. And what a wrap-up this was.EASILY could have been a trilogy or quadrilogy, but nope: this was a LONG movie to watch (3 hours). Took me three nights.Quite a lineup of famous actors whom I like: Jeremy Renner, Benedict Cumberbatch, Zoe Saldana, and a few older ones thrown in like Michael Douglas, Rene Russo, William Hurt. Then of course there's Robert Downey Jr. with his sarcastic wit.At 356 million clams, it's one of the most expensive films ever made. No doubt: I lost count of the scores of digital artists (ya, lotsa CGI)... must be over 1,000. Quite a thrill to watch, though you may need to absorb it in more than one sitting.8 outa 10.",positive
"What a disappointing ending after a decade of films!I went into the film desperate to like it, and while it had a few twists and funny moments I was under impressed.The film starts on a ominous note, Captain Marvel flying through space to rescue Tony on his ship. Despite the ship being out of power, the food and air reserves used up, and being several lightyears from Earth, Captain Marvel 'carries' the ship back to Earth where Tony is alive and healed.So after Thanos has destroyed half the universes population he travels to 'The Garden' where the Avengers, or what remains of them, go to find him living in a shack; he was surprisingly easily defeated despite being so strong (even without the stones)
After they discover he's destroyed the stones and Thor murders him, they go about thier lives.Five years later it's interesting to see how they're doing; it's funny that Tony has escaped to the country and raised a family with Pepper (which he jokingly said he would do during Age of Ultron after seeing Clint's house)
I did like what Clint had become, a bit dark but really cool, I still says he's my favourite and deserves his own film.
I hate what happened to Thor, although it is understandable. Its interesting to see they made a New Asgard (but how did Meek, Valkyrie and Corg survive Thanos at the start of Infinity Wars?)I thought it was clever how they brought Ant-Man back, using the rat in the car impound after it was seemingly abandoned.Now here's where it really fell apart for me. Inspired by Ant-Mans story of the quantum realm, Tony and Bruce turn the quantum drive van into a time machine to test thier time travelling theory, and once its working they then suddenly gain a working time travel portal inside the Avengers headquarters?
But rather than going back to stop Thanos from using the stones they decide to split up to steal the stones from the past.Maybe they're right not to go back to stop him destroying half the universe because that would mean joining forces with thier previous selves during the battle in Wakanda, but what about intervening during the days between that event and Thanos destroying the stones?It is clever if they had to re-enact scene from previous films to fit with the story, but I felt this was only done to highlight that the stones have played a role in most of the previous film, which everyone knows anyway!?And going to events in the past let characters interact with people in the past that are gone; Thor spoke to his mother, Tony spoke to his father, Steve saw Peggy and many former Shield/Hydra agents then got to impersonate and fight himself, Banner got to speak to 'The Ancient One'.To sum up
Thor and Rocket went for the Reality stone/Aether during the events of Thor, the Dark World.Ant-Man, Steve and Tony went for the Mind and Space stones during the events of Avengers Assemble.
And when thier attempt for the Space stone failed Steve and Tony went to the army base where Steve was first trained in Captain America the First Avenger (although I think this will set some time after the film)Banner went for the Time stone, tagging along with Ant-Man, Steve and Tony during the events of Avengers Assemble.Clint and Natasha went for the Soul stone, technically this wasn't in any film until Thanos went to Vormir in Infinity Wars.It seemed rather presumptive here that Clint and Natasha both thought they were what the other loved most - Red Skull said that only sacrificing what you loved most would give the Soul stone, I knew they were friends but they were what each other love most? Natasha won the race to kill herself and Clint got the stone, presumably this is because he's already lost his family (everything he loved) but it is still very presumptive of Natasha.
If Cint had died what would happen? Last I heard Natasha loved Banner who is alive (more or less)(I would have liked to see Steve go for the Soul stone to encounter Red Skull)Rhody and Nebula went for the Power stone during the events of Guardians of the Galaxy.
I thought it was a very weak story how Thanos was able to see the future Nebula through the past Nebula, I realise she is the same person but how can they be that connected. As Rhody returns to his time they disable and capture Nebula.
It was clever that the past Nebula took her time travel gear to impersonate her future self.With all six stones together Banner uses thier own gauntlet (how did they get that? The last one had to be made by the Dwarfs on Nidavellir?) and everyone who is destroyed by the stone comes back - except Gamora and Natasha (as they were sacrificed to the Soul stone to aquire it I had thought they'd come back too?)When the past Thanos was then brought to the future by the past Nebula it began as a good fight scene - I thought giving Thor his new hammer/axe Stormbreaker stifled him in Infinity Wars, but now they had stolen Mjolnir from the past and he had both!
Then even more incredulously Steve was able to wield Mjolnir (he was 'unworthy' of Mjolnir during Age of Ultron. Since then he has become a rogue agent and is considered a criminal yet this made his worthy? Now there's a bad message to send out)
Steve even uses Mjolnir to summon lightning, I thought that was Thors power? Mjolnir is just a tool to focus that power!! Odin said so!!As before however thier combined efforts are no match for Thanos and he summons his army to destroy them. Then comes the cheesy heroic moment as a portal opens and Black Panther walks out from Wakanda, with Sam flying past and all those who were 'destroyed' there.
From another portal Dr Strange then emerges from Titan with the others who were destroyed there.
Suddenly hundreds more portals open as the Wakandan army emerges, and an army of sorcerers lead by Wong, and an army of Asgardians lead by Corg and Meek (followed by Valkyrie riding a Pagasus)
To complete the medley Ant-Man suddenly breaks through the wreckage as a giant to bring Banner, Rocket and Rhody to the fight (by his own admission Ant-Man cannot sustain that size for long, and has to rest afterwards so how does he stay like that?)Honestly I wouldn't be surprised to see a Ravenger army lead by Stallone!!The huge battle then commences with Clint, and Spider-Man trying to get the Gauntlet with the stones away. I would have liked to see Wasp do more in the fight.As Thanos orders his ship to fire down on the battleground, hitting his own men and the Avengers, Captain Marvel arrives and destroys the ship by crashing through it several times.
I am relieved that this is her first appearance in a while as she says she's been off world as every other planet is also dealing with thier loss after Thaos destroyed everything.As I said in my review of Captain Marvel film, she's almost boring to watch as she has no weaknesses and would make the others seem redundant.As Thanos manages to get the gauntlet with the stones the Avengers attack him with the same outcome as before.
In what I thought would be Thanos' downfall he was surprising able to fight off Captain Marvel (so she DOES have a weakness) then Tony switches out the gauntlet with the stones with Thanos' old broken gauntlet.
Clicking his own fingers Tony uses the stones to destroy Thanos and his army, except that it kills him too.After Tony's funeral and everyone has gone back to their normal lives (Thor meanwhile leaves with the Guardians of the Galaxy and makes Valkrie the Queen of New Asgard), Banner tasks Steve with returning the stone to thier place in history where they got them (because 'The Ancient One' said there would be consequences if he didn't)
Something that later occurred to me, the Space and Mind Stones (when they took them in the past) were inside Loki's staff and in the Tesseract which both had to be broken to obtain the Stones. So how did Steve return them?After returning the Stones Steve doesn't come back, instead an old man sitting on a bench nearby (who must have been there all the time?) reveals he is Steve and that he stayed in the past to live out his life as if he had not been frozen.
He then gives the Captain America shield to Sam and it cuts to a scene of him in the past with Peggy.Not the ending expected, and bit overly complicated. But as Tony, Steve and Natasha are gone will there be a new team in the future? And will Thor and Banner return?",positive
Amazing movie!! I love this ending. I was blown away,positive
Good but the film was lengthier. Some scenes were boring at some piont. And I didn't feel any lag on this movie but I meant boring as laggy. But the climax was literally nailed...,positive
"Everyone anticipated that this film would have a significant impact on cinema history. The very massive casting of all the heroes on one screen for one cause is actually just a tired plot that has been done before, but in this case, the twist comes from the fact that they are MARVEL SUPERHEROES.Everybody was so thrilled when Nick presented himself to Tony in the Iron Man post-credit sequence; I genuinely believed something significant was about to happen. However, this movie wrecked it by making fun of the Back to the Future theme; that film is a masterpiece; there is no sense in demeaning it. Now, your decision to go through time to gather the stones definitely threw off the solution. Something was simply left unmentioned.The stunts were nice. I agree that the assembly scene in the conclusion is fantastic. It's not good, though. I can't only laud this movie for that one scene. The film has a lot of problems. Absolute inacceptability.",negative
It suffers from having to follow up one of the most anticipated films ever and even though it is spectacular with everything I still think infinity war is better.,positive
"Not sure why so many people are so negative about this movie. The build up of 22 films to this couldn't have been better. I get goosebumps every time they come through the portals. Definitely was sad with Cap and Iron Man, but at some point you have to move on. I truly wanted this to be it, but knowing Feige and how well he's done I am excited for the future of the MCU. My only wish, I hope DC figures itself out. Truly a shame they are wasting the Justice League. It's not a competition, just do it right.",positive
The hype is promising really good ending to the infinity saga.,positive
"I really enjoyed this movie. I liked it just as much as Infinity War. I'm sad Endgame won't be on Netflix ( it will be on Disney Now, for a ridiculous price) so I can just stream all the Avenger Movies right after each other.We see a lot of great characters get a good ending. 3 hours seemed like a long time when going in to the theater but eventually the filmed picked up its pace. The beginning/parts of the middle were a little slow but they had to show emotional feelings and conversations.",positive
Infinity war was way better. Infinity war was way better.,positive
Marvel really stepped up its game in this movie and it was a great wrap up to phase 3 of the MCU. I love the effects and the whole movie in general 10/10,positive
"For some reasons I didnt find it as good as its predecessor. Story was average ,at some point it felt it is not moving at all.
Linking movie with the pre sequels is very bad specially for those who are watching Marvel movie for the first time. Acting is by far the best from all the characters and bringing back all the characters together in one movie was a great task by Marvel Universe. All in all this movie is not for non-marvel fan. If you have been an ardent fan of Marvel Universe ,this sure will be a joy ride.",positive
"What can I say this movie is amazing, it blew my mind and my expectations. If this movie doesn't receive Oscars I will be surprised.... I went to the double screening of Infinity Wars and End Game. I'm just home, tired but still amazed. The Russo brothers are beyond legendary... they need to be given a Star Wars franchise immediately. Can't wait to see it again.",positive
I love this movie 10/10 but due to iron man's death 7/10.,positive
You show us that a women! sacrificed her life to protect us from the very person.,negative
It end right now and i cry cry and cry for my favorite hero.,positive
I must say when I sat down to watch Endgame I was expecting something else. This movie totally went left an once that plot was unraveled I literally feared for the hero's because Thanos isn't just any enemy. He's brutal. Couldn't have asked for a better ending to the infinity wars. Loved it,positive
Im still in such a shock and I think I experience so many emotions I felt like I was electrified to that screen in the same time I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and all this 3 hours TAS like a 30 minutes.I don't think we ever seen more epic superhero movie.I don't intend to spoil the movie and all I'm just going to say I don't think that one watching will be enough to understand what is going on in this morning so I'm planning to go back and then I'm going to make proper spoiler review it's SaturdayI'm so glad that I am witnessing this majestic movie!,positive
I'll rerate it when I se it in better video quality. It was better than infinity war and infinity war is one of the best Marvel movies i think. Ser the movie!,positive
It was Amazing and everything I wanted it to be if you are a big fan you are going to love this one,positive
"Yeahhh....marvel took everything to make the movie they had promised, the most splendid comic flick I ,and to be honest anyone, has ever seen.
First of all do not EVEN think about predicting the following events because from the first 15 mins of the movie you will be completely aware that it is not just another heros-win film.After that , the stoy line was very clear and away of confusion,no illogical-comical dialog or narration, wonderful acting ,and of course the most important one,the well done directing by Russo brothers.The mixture of all of these mad the movie so great that I as a Marvel hater really did enjoyed it.",positive
"While Endgame is a competent enough film with satisfying conclusions to many of the characters, it is also an incredibly frustrating film due to a number of fundamental issues. Also, I could have spoiled the title of this film after I saw Infinity War if I didn't know any better to think the callback to Doctor Strange's quote was gaucheThe film starts up with Hawkeye losing his entire family, and then with Tony and Nebula being saved in the middle of space by Captain Marvel, and once he is brought back to Earth he scolds Captain America for essentially causing half the universe to be wiped out for his freedom, when really it's equally his fault for not running off to work with Captain America. And Captain Marvel acts arrogant as usual as the Avengers call her out on it, leading me to believe that the film is true to the real animosity behind the set towards Brie Larson's attitude to her coworkers. Anyways, she brings them to where Thanos is and Thor kills him like the chump he is because I guess using the infinity gauntlet has tenderized his meat enough for him to be decapitated this time around. Captain Marvel then immediately leaves after saying there's thousands of other planets going through the same thing, even though Earth is the only one presumably working to undo the destruction of half the universe's population, which is possibly more important than Captain Marvel helping an elderly alien cross a street.Fast forward five years, and Scott is brought out of the quantum realm thanks to a rat stepping on the control panel, working both as an excellent cheap joke and as a deus ex machina. Scott has a character moment with his now teenaged daughter briefly before teaming up with Avengers and explaining how time travel is a possibility if one could navigate the quantum realm, which is now a possibility. But prior to this Captain America tries to teach people to look on the bright side. Scarlet Johansen manages emoting effectively for the first time in her entire acting career.Tony Stark has started a new life with Pepper, and the two now have a daughter. The team gives Tony a vial of Pym juice and explain their hopes of time travel and undoing Thanos' snap, but Tony mocks them for being so ridiculous given that he is the only one on the team who has lost nothing out of the whole ordeal, and he refuses to help. The team tasks Bruce for the job, and he has now managed to control the Hulk and the two work in unison now. Instead of creating time travel, they manage to push time through Scott, aging and de-aging him before returning him to normal and playing the whole discovery off as a joke rather than what it actually is; the key to immortality. Tony, in mere seconds of screentime, uncovers the secret to time travel and the team is off to the races. New Asgard is a run-down mess with the few Asgardian survivors, and worse yet, Thor has become a morbidly obese drunkard due to PTSD, and this is a running joke throughout the movie. Black Widow recruits Hawkeye as he cosplays as her in the live-action Ghost in the Shell film, slaying criminals in cold blood, I guess. This is a short interaction despite these being two of the most important characters in the film. I guess it's more important for Black Widow to be making the same jokes about Rocket Raccoon throughout the film rather than explore her character more, but I suppose they have to save material for the upcoming Black Widow film.
They plan out their time travel shenanigans. They have only enough Pym juice for a round trip each, until they conveniently grab more later from the past, however, since this is an action film, it would be unacceptable for this to be treated as a heist, and instead there has to be huge mistakes in each part of their plan in sequences that are so disparately linked that the brisk pace becomes jarring and awkward, and scenes stop flowing together the way they did in Infinity War. Many interactions occur between characters which would have been impossible without this time travel, one of which being an encounter between Tony and a 70s version of his father, which might be satisfying if it weren't so contrived. There are many nods to previous films which are mostly charming, but unfortunately similar to Terminator: Genisys. Captain America has an interesting fight with himself, with younger him mistaking present him as Loki in disguise. But Captain America says ""Bucky is alive"" to distract younger Captain, which seems a bit too reckless if time-travel logic were taken with any form of sincerity in this film. Nebula and Falcon knock out Star-Lord from the beginning of Guardians of the Galaxy, which might possibly even lead to his death considering what happens after this moment in the original film. The most infuriating of all has to be when Black Widow and Hawkeye learn they must sacrifice someone they love to get the soul stone, which is knowledge Tony should have, as he was within earshot of the conversation of Gamora's death in the previous film. I guess Stark has no respect for a man who has lost his family, and was sending Hawkeye there to die, but instead Black Widow sacrifices herself. Even worserer, Nebula gets hacked via what appears to be a crossed wifi signal and Thanos learns of the plans, and a switcheroo is done for past Nebula to infiltrate the Avengers' base. On a positive note, Hulk has a great interaction the Ancient One in which we learn that Doctor Strange gave Thanos the stone willingly just to convince her to give Hulk the stone at that moment, which is perhaps the only intriguing use of time travel in the film.Anyways, Hulk does the snap and it nearly kills him despite being nearly immune to gamma radiation, yet Thanos faired better with killing half the universe and then destroying the stones with their own power which was possible apparently. And then the team gets ambushed by Thanos and nearly die, even though they should all be dead considering they were blasted before all but one of them realized the threat, which leads to another big fight with Thanos, where literally everyone who was snapped away comes back and has their moment to shine kicking Thanos' ass for a couple seconds before being shown to be a chump.Captain Marvel shows up to save the day about twenty minutes into the fight to decide the fate of the entire universe, and takes out Thanos' battleship in mere seconds, but this is the kind of thing that thousands of planets across the universe are going through all the time and they don't have a regular guy with a powersuit to help them with it thus Captain Marvel was too busy to defeat Thanos I guess, even though according to Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige she's stronger than Thanos, which, much to Anita Sarkeesian's dismay is disproven as Danvers is taken out with a single punch from vanilla Thanos, just like everybody else on the team. Somehow 2014 Thanos feels stronger than Thanos was with all of the infinity stones, which makes sense if you also consider that Danvers became stronger than all of the infinity stones by being blasted by the energy from a single infinity stone. What I'm trying to say is the MCU has become knockoff Dragon Ball Super with a massive powercreep problem in which all of the heroes are now so powerful that the enemies have to be even more powerful to maintain the underdog feel, and it's a confusing mess that you might as well turn your brain off for. Whatever, Captain America says ""Avengers assemble"" so rule of cool I guess.Anyways, there's a nod to an upcoming all-female superhero flick which reminds me of the Ghostbusters reboot. And then Tony tricks Thanos by doing a bait and switch and states ""I am Iron Man,"" then snaps the army away, and he somehow lives long enough to have a moment with Pepper and Spider-Man.Iron Man gets a pretty decent funeral and a post-mortem moment with his family via a pre-recorded message. Then Captain America goes back in time to return the infinity stones, and ends up spending his life with Peggy, which I suppose means he was her unnamed husband from the past in the previous films. He returns old and passes his shield on to Falcon. The time travel from the Incredible Hulk has greater implications than one might think. The problem is Hulk has essentially discovered immortality, though it's brushed off as a joke and a terrible mistake. There's another major problem with this; we've brought back alternate Gamora from 2014 and killed 2014's Nebula, doing a switcheroo, but we end up with both, essentially undoing Gamora's death from Infinity War. We can undo all other permanent deaths by bringing the deceased from alternate timelines into this one.
By the way, several dead-dead characters are back despite still being considered dead, which doesn't make the switcharoo feel like any less of a cop-out. Quill is left with a Gamora who hasn't experienced anything with him, but that will certainly be sorted out in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.
While Endgame is a relatively competent film, it has many positives and negatives which can make it a polarizing experience for fans, plebs, and snobs alike. There are numerous moments which are both memorable and satisfying, but there's others that are wholly unimmersive and disappointing. While Tony Stark's death was wholly expected, Black Widow's feels bizarre. The heroes' capabilities now are so grand that they together are almost omnipotent, and yet somehow vanilla Thanos was still able to beat them in a fight without the infinity stones despite Thor kicking his ass in Infinity War when he had all the stones. Basically, the MCU has become Dragon Ball Super, and what with their super safe approach we can expect a whole lotta fan service for fans of each individual character regardless of what their power levels should be. Ant-Man expanding inside Thanos would have made for a much better climax.",positive
"This is now my all time favourite movie... and it is a very weird reason why. Not a regular reason, like objectively speaking, story, characters, meaning etc. etc.. It is my favourite movie because i have never felt such a connection with what was happening on screen. It is the absolute culmination of the MCU, of 11 years of building something so huge that it needs no introduction anymore. I felt respected as a fan while also being given an absolute masterpiece that in my opinion ended in the right and simbolical way. I have went through every single emotion and feeling in this movie.And the final reason why i am putting this as my favourite movie:
*I have never in my life cried out of PURE JOY, it was always accompanied by other reasons or emotions up until now. No, this time my eyes were watering out of pure JOY. The kid inside of me who thought would never witness such a grand spectacle, just released in pure excitement and thrill.To all the people who worked on this, from all the fans, and at least, especially from me : *THANK YOU*...",positive
"I reccomed for those who didn't watch the movie but main problem of this movie is change of characters.
This behaviour and attitudes. Some people like it some didnt but if we ignore those its a good movie",positive
"There was so many plot holes in this movie and was so far off what I expected it would be. And what's with this growing trend of killing off fan favorite characters? Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and of the x-men from some unknown source that probably won't get explained until Dark Phoenix. 11 years of anticipation only to be hugely let down buy this movie. It seems to be a habit of Disney to take what is loved and ruin it. I'm tired of it and the bottom line is that Hollywood hasn't had an original thought in so long, they're only left with destroying all the things that we the fans love.Why didn't Dr. Strong use the stone to bring back Tony Stark just like he did with the apple in the first movie. He was able to manipulate time to one object (the apple) but couldn't do that to Tony without reversing Tony snapping his fingers? And what about Vision or Karen (Carter's niece that Captain America was involved with at some point. And what about Loki? He just disappears forever? There are many plot wholes left with a disappointing end to an 11 build up.Marvel, you failed. This is not a product worthy of creator who recently passed away.",negative
"An absolute love letter to Marvel. If there was a 5 hour cut, I'm down.",positive
"When I saw Endgame, it was totally worth the two hour wait. It was beautifully told and while we said goodbye to some of the best characters ever, it was still a masterpiece.",positive
"Avengers End Game is a thorough enjoyment through out the entire three hours. Not even a single moment I felt bored and full of humour and as well as emotional. Probably this may be the best of all the avengers series.Coming to characters, I always like Doctor strange. So, at first I was kind of worried because doctor strange had to sacrifice in the Avengers Infinity War. But then I also like Ant Man which convinced me that I would enjoy. Of course there is more heroic characters like Iron Man, Captain America and etc but I most liked the Ant Man and Doctor strange and I need to say that I am not disappointed at all not even for one percent. For others also, it will definitely be satisfying as the movie holds greater screenplay and perfect dialogues and more of that amazing 3D and background score which makes Avengers End Game makes the perfect movie.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame brings us where we left off in Avengers: Infinity War, with Thanos (Brolin) collecting all six infinity stones and wiping out half the universe. In the aftermath, what's left of the Avengers (Downey, Evans, Hemsworth, Johansson, Cooper, Renner, Rudd, Larson, Gillan, Cheadle, Ruffalo, Gurira) all must band together to go back in time to collect the stones before Thanos can and prevent their current reality.When the first Avengers movie dropped in 2012, it proved that Cinematic Universes can work. When Age of Ultron dropped in 2015 and more avengers joined the cast, it proved that Cinematic Universes are busy, also superhero movies need a respectable villain and a movie of that caliber needed more than one solo writer-director. When Infinity War dropped in 2018, it showed that it can subvert the audiences expectations and still entertain while not waste anytime introducing characters the audience has already known for ten years worth of movies. Finally Endgame proved that a movie can completely undo everything the predecessor has done and still be revered for its scope, for its culmination while giving certain characters well developed character arcs.Originally this movie was supposed to be called Avengers: Infinity War Part II; and that's where the first problem originates. It's kind of inevitable that losses in a Cinematic Universe would feel hollow because the actors have contracts and more movies or TV shows they have to complete outside the movie they are currently performing in. When actors contracts expire, there's a realization that they have be given a proper sendoff; which in the viewers mind means, 'don't get too attached to X'. This being a cog in a much larger clock, and setting up something even larger than itself, allows the audience to zoom out and see a bigger picture, and that picture is, 'we need to keep these characters afloat and we need spinoffs and TV shows that we can keep pumping out so we can make money'. And after watching the movie, I am baffled at what they are trying to produce, and it is impossible not to look at this movie and not see a bigger picture.As a whole, the movie is well acted and directed and also wastes no time setting up characters the audience already knows. The action is well executed with beautiful long takes and hits that look like they actually hit instead of quick cuts and shaky camerawork we are unfortunately used to by now. Downey gives one of the best performances inside of the MCU, and the special effects, which probably comprises at least ninety percent of the movie, are all excellent. Unlike Infinity War, the war part actually makes sense and is not just filler until the real bad guy shows up, also unlike Infinity War, the characters that die actually strike a nerve. But where Infinity War succeeded, the lighting is pretty bad in some scenes near the ending of the movie, also the introduction of time travel makes the timeline of the movie confusing and set up for the next movies problematic, because it is impossible to look at this movie and not see a bigger picture.If you have not already jumped onto the Marvel Cinematic Universe by now, there is no reason you should check out this movie. If you are not dazzled by a plethora of famous people jumping around a simulated environment, you're not going to applaud at the resurrection of our favourite heroes, or at the big female team up against the man, (which admittedly felt a little hollow because there is no real set up to it). Anyone who loves superhero movies would love the intricacies of the that are put into this movie. If you started at the beginning with the first Iron Man and watched even seventy percent of the movies in the MCU, you can appreciate the development of our original avengers and like the directions our new heroes are going to eventually take.So in the end, this is a popcorn movie. It is fun, as long as you don't think too much about it. It is a good ending to the Avengers while showing there are more possibilities for our remaining heroes and shows unlimited possibilities for the future, even if I am not interested in some of the spinoffs. Gone are the days, were the studios would just make a movie with a beginning middle and end. Now we make movies that set up more movies, and looking at the bigger picture, this is movie that seems large in its scale but is tiny when compared to what's to come. The big picture looks good, but has some problems in it's connecting pieces.",positive
It was great. More than just an superhero action movie. Thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie.,positive
This is definitely one of the best films I've ever seen. A brilliant conclusion to the MCU and I can't wait for more content. 😊,positive
"Some people compare the Avengers series with the Star Wars series and the Lord of the Rings series. I don't know where the comparison is. Not to mention that the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings are of the movie history level, at least in one sense, none of the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings series is a single movie about a single character. Their films have many characters, but what they produce can be called epics. Films like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are enduring classics and will be model textbooks for many years to come. So which Marvel movie is worthy of the word ""classic""? Over the past 11 years, I have followed the footsteps of Superhero movie. I have seen all the Marvel movies shown in the cinema. I can only say that I am worthy of myself. But if one only talks about feelings when evaluating a movie, what are the other values of this movie?",positive
"Marvel has done it again. I won't spoil it but it has everything we've come to love about this franchise. I think only one or two things could change to improve it, but nothing major that's for future! It felt like family on the screen, and the theater filled with avid fans felt like family too. It was a crowning achievement, Stan would have been proud.",positive
"The title of this review may lead you to believe that I am not a fan of this film - which is false. I actually like this film quite a bit, but ultimately does not deserve the 'one of the best movies ever made' reputation it is getting.Let's talk about the pros:The visuals are outstanding. The CGI team once again prove they are on top of their game here and the work here is marvelous. I must also note that the directors (The Russo Brothers) did an excellent job of carrying 30+ characters into the film and still managing to give each and every one a moment to shine.
There is also an exceptionally large amount of buzz surrounding the ending of this film (as well as the final hour in general), which I believe more than definitely contributes to the film being held with such high regard - and yes, the final hour is fantasticBUT...Let's not forget that this is a three-hour film and almost all of the flaws are contained in the first two hours.
The majority of the first act of the film is significantly slower-paced to the rest, which on it's own works as it uses the time wisely as it perfectly portrays the aftermath of the events following Infinity War. However, this slow-paced first act ultimately affects the overall structure of the film as the second and third act are much faster.I also have some issues with the second act, there are definitely some scenes here that could easily be removed without affecting the plot (and the film would actually be overall better as a result). For example: The 'diner' scene in which Hulk poses with fans is cringe-worthy at best and while it's intention is be funny is instead awkward.CONCLUSIONAvengers: Endgame is definitely a must-watch for fans of the MCU and action films in general, but let's not overrate this purely because of the final act.8/10",positive

"Starting off with 23 days after Thanos's 'big snap', the entire world is devastated and broken. The Avengers are trying to bring everyone back, but will they succeed?
Endgame ties up the loose ends perfectly, into a nice little bow. Not meant to be seen just once, this movie is funny, dramatic, nerve wracking and absolutely PERFECT. After it is over, Endgame will leave a void, like you've lost a dear friend. This roller coaster 3 hour astounding action packed cgi AWESOMENESS is bound to leave you misty-eyed.
Avengers Endgame is not just a movie, it's an experience. We love you 3000.",positive
"Avengers Endgame follows the events 23 days after Thanos did the 'big snap'. The remaining Avengers are shattered and broken, with Tony Stark stuck in space. Nobody has a clue how to bring the others back or kill the ultimate super-villain. How will this end though? - With ABSOLUTE perfection.
The culmination of the 21 Marvel movies ends ties the knots into a perfect little bow, with of course some heartbreaking losses. The ending, without post-credits too, is very satisfying. Russo brothers add a dramatic punch to the 3 hour storyline, as well as plenty of humour in the first half. The second half however, is action packed, and emotions run sky-high. The end will and has shattered me, as well as brought a ray of hope along with it.
Although jumping with the timelines, catching up with old times can be confusing, and it has stretched the movie a tad bit, but that's the idea. Of bringing a conclusion. Which it does. Who knew even end credits could also be so satisfying? Some actors do get a better screentime, although I found the distribution better than Infinity War. The whistles, shrieking, whooping, occasional sniffling and clapping throughout the entire length of the movie is proof enough of how EPIC the film is. The film is a roller coaster of emotions, funny in one. exhilarating in the next, and emotional in the end. No questions about the set design, action and special effects, it's larger than life and top-notch
It's a tearjerker, and bound to leave a void, but its feels like a good conclusion. It's a lot to take in, for sure. Did I mention how many times I said the word satisfying?
I swear, MCU will never be the same without Avengers. Love you 3000.",positive
"My mother broke tears when Tony Stark paid the price. In a cgi dominated film you know they did something right when someone can still feel emotions over the characters' sacrifices. After 20+ movies of Marvel this was an epic ending. Big applause to the actors, writers, and crew who brought this all together. Well done.",positive
"This movie isn't for everyone. Unlike Infinity War, this movie is much more character-driven than previous installments. The story, while a little messy, still came together in a way that made sense to me. The time travel was different from what we all know, and it's explained rather clearly in the film in a way that makes sense. The main story, while a little messy, was also pretty strong and held up on the screen.After the masterpiece that was Infinity War, Endgame had a lot to live up to. AT the same time, it couldn't be just like Infinity War without potentially losing the major emotional moments that have been built up to for 11 years. The slower pacing works in the film's favor, making every beat hit home and keeping me invested as it filled out its three-hour runtime.In the end, the film works for the most part. There are a few missteps and a few oddities in the film, but unless you get hung up over time travel or don't like superhero movies, you'll probably enjoy this movie to great extent.",positive
What a masterpiece that russo brothers made you should definitely go and watch and after this movie i was like damn man we are not kids anymore,positive
I have loved the mcu from the beginning. The ambition and scope was a massive gamble that has paid off on the most part. Each film added to the overall story arc to get us to the endgame. So my main question is this. Why did we need another 2 hours of build up before we got to the bones of the film. The time travel stuff was boring and predictable and went on far to long. Yes some scenes where clever like the 2 caps but to many misses and not enough hits during that sequence. Then there was thor the washout which was funny for about 2 minutes but should have been nipped in the bud far earlier in the film. So all these parts got us to the point where hulk was able to click his fingers and reverse what thanos had done. My main problem with this part of the film was that there was no proper explanation what happened to everyone for 5 years. Surely they could have put a scene in which was a reverse of the opening bit where Mrs Barton and the kids disappeared but instead they reappear to see Clint had gone. Also who has a phone that is still charged after 5 years. The last point was one of many continuity errors in the film such as nebula shooting herself meaning she should cease to exist seeing as her past self has died. Maybe I am being hypercritocal but it's certainly not a perfect film and has its flaws including pacing and lack of action but if this is the end o feel robbed.,positive
It was sad but one of the best movies ever there were sad deaths but epic scenes that wow so many people,positive
"I know that this is the end of an era but I didn't like somethings on this movie:
Fat Thor;Captain Marvel: where was she? She just appeared in some specific times;Where is Captain Marvel's cat? hahaThey tried to be funny everytime;Things were so easy to be done: I mean ant man told Tony about the time travel and Tony found out a way really fast and easy. Why he didn't think about it earlier? I mean I thought ant man would be the key for it, I mean using him because he was in the quantum realm for long time, maybe he could get some energy or something like that... but no, Tony created everything, so ant mas was useless;the movie was too long, some scenes cut be shorter;no after credit scenes: I think it would be great having scenes for the next movie;nebula killed herself and didn't disappear;they changed the past lots of times: Loki disappeared, Thor's mother.In general I liked the movie but I prefer Infinity war.",positive
"The spine of a movie is the scenario and similar to the recent popular superhero movies, this movie's is jelly. It does not include creativity and smartly combined events.First of all, weak script writers hold on to time travel concept in order to make
writing easier with lack of creativity. They do not need to stick onto a logic - they can just explain everything by time travel. This movie has Terminator Genisys impressions which I think was the least fun to watch of Terminator series.Second, I hate repeated usage of ""Deux ex Machina"" in these superhero movies. This a concept which should strictly be avoided due to lacking creativity, but trending contrarily. At the end of Batman vs Superman; while they were both fighting against Doomsday and losing, Wonder Woman pops up and saves their day.
In Avengers, when the superheroes were losing against Thanos' spaceship, Captain Marvel comes from the space unexpectedly and fragments the spaceship into parts. Why was she not around until they were beaten enough and lose hope? The writers do not leave us without a logic expression: She was busy saving other planets. But Captain Marvel is not the only superhero to poup at the end. Zounds of ""good"" superheroes enter into the scene from some magical gates to fight against the ""bad"" army. (impressions from Lord of the Rings Ghost Army - but it had creativity and logic within)1 sentence summary of the movie: While good heroes are losing against bad, many other good heroes appear somehow and they all save the world together.There is another controversial trend rising : Instead of creating black superheroes from scratch (which requires creativity), white heroes hand the superhero job over to black people. In Spider Man into the Spider Verse, the regular Spider Man hands the job to a black youngster.
This movie follows the trend, too. At the end, Captain America assigns a black guy as the new Captain America.
However, we are not seeing movies with black superheroes in the lead role. (Always side roles)
If the filmmakers are sincere, the lead superheroes in following movies must be acted by black people (especially Spider Man and Captain America),
otherwise this trend is just a forced gesture.Oh, the movie also does not skip emphasizing another cliche: the of the importance of family.So that the filmmakers have $400M to spend on a movie, I believe they can also spend some money, effort and time on creating authentic, non-cliche scenarios without cutting corners.If you are just seeking a vast variety of superhero collision without thinking much, go see it.
But if you are seeking a movie with an original, creative scenario keeping focus on a particular character (as in Terminator 1&2, Avatar and Alita), avoid wasting 3 hours of your life.",negative
With it wrapping up the Infinity Saga it makes an ending that is amazing and so sad! This movie made me completely satisfied and I just want the Russo brothers to know that this movie was phenomenal!,positive
"Avtar was best in 2001-2010 Niw this is best in 2010-2020. Best Movie of decades. I got emotional at lots of moments.

The endgame satisfies the humongous expectations after infinity war. It's also poetic that infinity saga begins with Ironman and end with him. Captain America finally gets to dance with Peggy. Final confrontation between Thanos and whole MCU characters alone is enough to satisfy the Marvel fans. Russo brothers did an excellent job in bringing all the characters to share same screen space. Will we get another interconnected huge movie series like infinity saga? I think it would be difficult.,positive
"A lot of films take you on an emotional roller coaster but for us Marvel fans, this was the creme de la creme. A masterpiece. If you nit-pick any film you'll find holes on top of holes. Continuity errors. Things that happen without reason. This movie has so many super heroes in it, the amount of logic errors are mountainous and also, who cares? We don't watch these movies to pick them apart. We watch them to escape our universe and temporarily enter theirs. This movie could have been better in many ways but it was damn near perfect with all its flaws. Reminds me of humans...",positive

"Natalie Portman is my focus; first of all she's not really even in this movie (or any other movie); The thing about Natalie Portman is that she is so f-ing hot that she could be uttering the most embarrassing lines ever written, and look like a deer in the headlights, but you are still engrossed with her look; those brown eyes and angelic figure leaves most people with the intrigue of: ""Who is this piece -and why am I enamored with her? The simple answer: She is constructed of a little bit of ""that thing"" from all walks of female life. In other words, she is stunningly beautiful and comes across as extremely bright-which she is! Portman is rare, and keeps a low profile. This also adds to her mystery and creates more and more intrigue on her part.",positive
"For a standalone movie, I give it a 7/10. Sadly, this is not a standalone movie because it just happens to follow up one of the best action movies ever - for that I give it a 3/10 to balance things out, so a total of 5/10.What I really don't get, even for people that only think of how to pocket more cash, is why they show such disrespect for their customers from whom they expect recurring revenues. I mean Marvel and in general franchise movies totally count on coming back viewers, so the previous movie literally pays the next.In Endgame's case they spent $400 million expecting to gross $2 (at least) billion, and they felt sorry for the few dollars more they would have spent to hire a decent writer to come up with a decent script - the single thing that pushed Infinity War to break away from the pack. That's a cheap attitude, which will eventually backfire.Where to start?The story is a disconnected, incoherent mess. Think of Infinity War script? Well think of the exact opposite for Endgame. There is absolutely no story connection whatsoever and it clearly shows in the way the actors perform on screen. The confidence everyone had in Infinity War simply is not here; it's like they don't really get what they are up to.The humor that flows naturally through to discharge the intense moments in Infinity War is tried to be copied here, only in a bad manner. I don't want to spoil things, but having Cap commenting on his butt, I mean, come on people..Time travel? Seriously? That was the best you could come up with to get over it? What a brilliant, original idea! Only a couple of hundred other movies and TV series have already thought of that, only to come up with a messy mindjob, regardless. Putting RDJ mumbling mumbo-jumbo quantum stuff to explain how time travel works (btw quantum mechanics has absolutely nothing to do with time in general), just left everybody in awe of what the heck he is talking about. Having watched the trailers, and the theories that crawled through the Internet, I was ready to go there and watch that, but somehow I was hoping otherwise - that was an absolute letdown, especially the way it was delivered.Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans managed to save some of it in their own way - nothing spectacular though. Others like Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo were totally crashed under the burden of the ridiculous script. As for the rest of the crew, well, ok, let's get paid and get outta here..Thanos, the more complex character of all, and the one that made Infinity War a success, appeared here just like all the other villains before him - think of Loki and Ultron and you get the idea of what Thanos has been reduced here to.All in all, Infinity War was truly hard to match and for that it made Endgame truly hard to watch. Infinity War, for its own reasons, set the bar really high. We have seen that coming in other sequels as well. What comes in mind as an example is The Matrix followed by Matrix Reloaded; the kind of standout movie that is plagued by its own successor.Infinity War followed by Endgame is not an exception. Many of us already knew that before walking into the theater. Sad to say though, Endgame eventually turned out as another example of what you get if you only do it for the money.",negative
"This movie was definitely a 10/10. So much action, suspense, and a lot of emotion. I am not one to cry, but some scenes especially the death scenes made me feel like I might. Make sure to stay for the after credit scene. Once the first set of credits are over, the after credit scene will role. It is more of a tribute to the original avengers though. After that there is nothing else but credits.",positive
"This movie is not just a movie, it's an event. A payoff after 11 years of build up. If you've not been in the marvel train, then you'll enjoy this movie.
However, if you've grown up with these characters, this movie is everything you'll ever want, and so much more.",positive
10 stars because it almost made me cry (when i say almost I really mean almost because I do not cry),positive
Great movie full of surprising and amazing moments. Thanks for MARVEL and Russo brothers for this amazing work.,positive

I was expecting more, but satisfied with what I got.",positive
"A great way to conclude the first 21 movies with this epic 3hr conclusion. The complexity of which this movie ties in/goes back to multiple other Marvel movies is unreal & makes sense. You will laugh, cheer & cry.....",positive
"A great cinematic experience this certainly is. Once again the Russo brothers and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have managed to craft a film that juggles a vast array of characters superbly well.There's also such a sense of emotional resonance and poignancy to this film, which is executed nicely in the first and third acts that concludes the arcs of many established heroes. It's a superb send off to Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, whose journeys ended in a palpable way. It was a nice touch to send Steve back in time to finally spend his life with Peggy Carter, and fitting for Tony to save the day by sacrificing himself, ensuring the Infinity Saga began and ended with him.However, I do have some issues, mainly with the fact the second act with the 'time heists' wasn't nearly as interesting or thrilling as I hoped it would be. It didn't drag the pace of the film down too much, as the three hour runtime zipped by overall, but it wasn't that fulfilling.There's also some consistency issues with how characters are able to handle Infinity Stones like it's nothing, despite it being set up in Guardians of the Galaxy that most beings would disintegrate trying to hold them. Also the Avengers are able to fashion a gauntlet from Iron Man's tech to hold the stones despite it being set up in Infinity War that a special gauntlet needed to be forged to hold them. These things bugged me a little.However, these are only minor nitpicks in what was an overall great film, which delivered a lot of brilliant moments of fan service as well has a fantastic final battle which was set up and executed with great precision.I preferred Infinity War as a film, but as an experience Avengers Endgame stands on its own in the current cinematic landscape.",positive
"This has to be one of the most overrated films I've ever seen, it was long boring and tiring to watch. The story was boring slow and at times just felt unnecessary. I genuinely don't understand how people can say it was a 10/10 film.",negative
A brilliant end to the Infinity Saga however I can't help but be put off by the amount of unsubtle product placement all throughout.,positive
"'Avengers: Endgame'... easily one of the biggest, most-hyped, grandest and monumental movies ever made. The epic culmination to one of, if not- the biggest movie franchises ever, spanning over ten years of work. The hype for this movie was unbelievable. Even bigger than that of 'Infinity War'. People shouting spoilers everywhere came along with that, of course, but that didn't change the hype. I had the whole movie spoiled for me (yep.) and I still went and watched it with the same hype. How did I find it?There is, as expected, a LOT to say:I was annoyed. But not in a bad way. I loved it. So why am I annoyed? Because of the little flaws that made this movie short of one of the best movies ever made. But I'll start with the good things:This movie really felt like a conclusion to 22 other movies. The scale is epic and not only does it complete the colossal story like it should, but it also complete's all the character's arcs in the best ways possible. It doesn't just feel like a money-making standalone film, but it goes and solves many problems across multiple films. That includes story problems, character problems, plot-holes and more. Every arc, every layer and every line is so seamlessly intertwined and concluded that it all wraps up so delightfully, and the fact that it goes beyond just solving the stories not only reaches our huge expectations, but defies them and surpasses them.And even still, along with the gargantuan load it already carries, Endgame manages to carefully and skilfully weave it in with real, hart felt emotional depth. Now, I'm not just saying this as a Marvel fanboy, but this film was truly an emotional roller coaster. It truly delivers sentiment. To prove that I'm not just saying this as a fan- many found Infinity War emotional. Was it? Well, it had it's emotional moments every now and then, but it was very much hidden under the action. I'm not saying that as a problem, but it didn't feel quite as powerful as it should have been on the emotional aspect. The action aspect, certainly, but the dramatic side- not so much. This film, on the other hand was powerful on both aspects. It delivers great action along with emotional depth. This movie makes you feel happy, sad, angry, mesmerised, supportive, hopeful and more. A true emotional roller-coaster, filled with laughs and cries alike. Just like in Infinity War, where each character had a chance to shine in terms of action, this film gives each character a chance to shine in terms of action and emotion, raising goosebumps and making everyone scream in awe as it should, making this what might just be my favourite MCU movie yet.So, the story's magnificent and the impact is great. Oh, and the visuals, as usual, are great. So what are the flaws of this movie?Apart from the lack of storytelling through the camera, a problem which Marvel has always had, there were other things too, but they are hard to get into without some very minor 'kind-of' spoilers, so skip to the conclusion if you want to avoid them:MINOR SPOILERS: Thor in this movie, is basically a character played for laughs. He suffers from PTSD, but his reaction to it feels very silly, and is basically there to make fat jokes, drunk jokes, etc. That would have been fine if he used the rest of the movie to redeem himself, and although he does gain hope, he is still an alcoholic, and is still a target for 'fat' jokes. This makes his emotional scenes in the movie lack depth, and it doesn't feel as satisfying as it should have. Another small problem: Hulk. Hulk's character arc was perfect, but it was again, unsatisfying, as his arc completed in the beginning of the film, and there is no real Hulk action. Had this been done at the end of the film, however, it would have been perfect. Maybe this was to cut down on the already lengthy run time of over three hours, but if they're already going for an epic scope and a conclusion to over twenty films, even a four hour movie would have been fine by me. There's one more thing that isn't really a flaw, but I feel like it needs addressing. The time-travel part of the movie often has plot holes and the movie feels like it's constantly, desperately trying ot write itself out of them by making it's own rules. However, I wouldn't lower the rating for this, as I always think that it doesn't matter if a movie has plot holes as long as it still makes a good story out of it, which in this case- it did.There is one more thing which isn't really a flaw at all but just another something I feel that needs addressing. MAJOR SPOILER though:MAJOR SPOILERS: Like I said just now, this is not a flaw and one of the best scenes in the whole movie (probably one of the two most sad- for me at least) is Black Widow's death. Now- it's not the fact that this character died that is a flaw, obviously, but the fact that at the end, when practically EVERYONE was in the huge battle scene, she was the only one not there. It's not a problem, but I would have just loved to see just one massive fight where everyone took part, and the fact that she was the only one that wasn't there, as she died, was just so unsatisfying. I would have just loved to see just one massive fight where everyone took part, but it won't happen. Not a flaw, but I just wanted to put that out there.CONCLUSION:
'Avengers: Endgame' is definitely flawed, but it does almost everything and more a truly epic conclusion sure to deliver a goose-bump-raising, emotionally-powerful and hugely entertaining finale that delivers justice to it's ever-growing franchise.",positive
The Russo's did a FANTASTIC job with this one it focusses on the Original Avengers while they go back in time we see references and a lot more the Final battle was One Epic EPIC oh wait the most EPIC battle I have ever seen,positive
"I will try to not reveal anything about this movie because everything new will amaze you. It takes you well back in time and references other movies that just fit in perfectly. It gives shock and seeing all the characters on screen felt the wait worthwhile. Although this title did had some confusions from previous references, it still worked out. This is a must-see movie and I hope it will be enjoyable for everyone else as well.",positive
"This is an epic,or,an war epic.It probably one of the most epic films ever made.It is not perfect,but still one of the best movies ever.
Just as every marvel(the good ones) movie,it borrows a special genre.In this case,the war epic.It is magnificent to watch,with one of the best CGI effects people have ever seen.So,the flaw isn't the visuals.The character developments have been established by earlier films,and this film only deepens them.So,the characters aren't the problem,either.The biggest problem of this film is the plot.
The more convoluted a plot gets,the more frequently a plot hole appears.This film juggles a lot of plots,so naturally,a few plot holes appears.
Fortunately,this doesn't change the fact that this was a visual masterpiece.Unfortunately ,this sets up a high standard for cinematic universe finales.And the DCU.Let's just wish some film will achieve such greatness in the near future.",positive
"Pure cinematic mastery. This film was perfect from start to finish, there was not one scene I didn't enjoy. It's unbelievable that marvel can still raise the roof after 10 years.This was the most satisfying conclusion to anything I have ever watched. Most films fall short if they're ending a trilogy or saga but endgame didn't fall Flat it was triumphant and breath taking. Please see this film!!!",positive
"As a fan that still believes that Iron Man was most definitely the peak Marvel movie, I can't help but feel that this movie is very entertaining plus genuinely touching at the end but also spectacularly full of booming plot holes that DC gets smashed for in their films.Most obvious is that when Tony snaps his fingers, he is technically removing all evil from the films/MCU (as even Marvel couldn't be so daft as to think the finger snap will only target story specific villains).This mean any future villains will be some contrived fiction! Sorry Marvel, but major stuff up in film lore/logic.What was everyone doing during the finale? They bring everyone back, with little reasoning, just because time travel, yet most do little throughout. The gathering of female superheroes was banging, yet resulted in 30 seconds of titular edification. Marvel kicked a huge own goal with this effort. Captain Marvel, who I love the daylights out of, and is without doubt significantly more powerful than Thanos, still takes a beating at the hands of a far lesser being - yet she has the power of the Tesseract flowing through her, and Thanos, with no Infinity Stones attached, just ragdolls her.Probably the most noticable goof is that Peter Parker stays the same age even when he goes back to school, yet Ant-Man's daughter gets older, and Morgan Stark is like 4 years old. This literally couldn't happen as Spider-Man wasn't in the Quantum Realm.",positive
"What this studio has continued to do over the last decade is absolutely incredible. I can still remember the absolute thrill of sitting down in the theater and witnessing the creation of the MCU in the first Iron Man. Now, 11 years later, as a 19 year old, I can easily say that I experienced the same feelings I did all those years ago. I do not typically write reviews, but this movie deserves to be written about. It has moments where you laugh your ass off and it has moments where your heart is in your stomach. While I could write/complain about all of the things that I was upset about, or all of the things that caught me off guard, in the end the Russo Brothers made an absolute masterpiece that is there cherry on top of one of the greatest franchises of all time. I couldn't be happier with this film, and I couldn't be more excited to see what Marvel Studios has in store for hardcore fans such as myself.",positive
"Was very entertaining, marvel hasn't really put a foot wrong compared to DC.
Feels like the end of the franchise too an I need not need to see anymore from the franchise. Thanks for the memories maybe?",positive
"I am a big fan of the MCU, I have watched every Marvel movie ever released, even the not so good ones prior to the MCU. I thought Infinity War was incredible and this simply did not follow up the hype for me. The first two hours were pretty boring for me, I didn't like the fact that they made Thor into a punchline for the entire movie, it would have been fine if they did that before the time jump, or made him somehow get back into shape, but it was just dumb. The Hulk was not a physical presence for the second straight movie now. Black Widow's death was the one that I felt the most, Stark's end was touching while Spidey was there, but when Pepper stepped in, her lack of emotion made me feel nothing also. The fight scene at the end was great, but other than that, it was a so-so movie for me.",negative
"Uhhh so goood... I guess bigger is better and this is huge and I love it, the fights: great... Plot: great... Emotion:OOF (Would have been more emotional if it hadnt been spoiled... That isn't there fault tho) Comedy: great... Only issue the woman fight scene where literally all the women gather together and fight and we only see them, i agree women are important but i wanted to see everyone fight... Equally",positive
Avengers endgame is great but it has to be like smash bros the characters should be more like normal characters more from nintendo this time hulk is mario doctor strange is cloud and iron man is samus.,positive
"I really want to give this movie a ten but I hesitate because it doesn't follow its own rules on Time Travel. According to Bruce Banner and Ancient One, one simply can not go to their past and change it. Whatever happend in past is set in stone. If you try to go to past you end up in different timeline.
The 3/4th part of movie plays really well, with everyone hopping from timeline to timeline in order to get infinity stones to correct what thanos did. The battle was the best in history of cinema.
With all that aside. The ending where Steve Rogers goes to return the infinity stones to their respected timelines he gives them all back but doesn't come back. He stays in 1940 with Peggy. So far so good, but the problem is that he stays in different timeline than the main timeline. But at the end of the movie he comes back to the main timeline. They should have given explanation about this. Even if we think he managed to get here by another timeline Stark's device or Doctor Strange, it still doesn't explain the shield given to sam wilson. In battle Thanos shatters his shield, but apparently the shield comes back to him. There should also have be explanation of this.
With all that said the movie is certainly not a disappointment. It is the well deserved end to 11 year old Infinity Saga. You should definitely check out this and all the other films of MCU.",positive

Without a doubt the best of the all the marvel movies,positive
"Up till this morning Avengers Infinity War was my favorite of the MCU films. Avengers Endgame is now my favorite and not just MCU, but all time. Greatest story ever told in films. PHENOMENAL",positive
"I loved the film, it was amazing, the CGI is absolutely unrivaled by anything we have out there at the moment at this scale. The characters all came to their right and the acting (as always) was perfect.Why would I rate it anything lower than a 10/10 then? Here's why:
The ""time traveling"" aspect created plot holes so huge that it made it impossible to fully enjoy just how brilliant the film was.
1. The Avengers decide to travel back in time, Scott Lang and Steve Rogers warn the others to avoid Time Paradoxes, to which Bruce Banner/Hulk states that ""time does not work that way"" and that past and future events cannot happen in the now and the future cannot happen before the past, yada yada, essentially stating ""Time is Linear, the future is set, the past cannot influence us, we cannot influence it"". This by very definition means that if time is linear, a new timeline would exist if you change anything in the past, which means that they CANNOT go back to their own timeline, or they could've never gone back in the first place.
2. They have time-travel which according to hulk, won't change the past if they change their now, but more than that, THEY HAVE AN INFINITY GAUNTLET AAAANNNDD TIME STONE. How Gamora died, Black Widow died and Iron Man died, and weren't brought back to life makes absolutely NO sense. Gamora came from the past before she was killed by Thanos to 2023 and she and Star Lord could start things fresh and be together, why couldn't the same be done for Tony Stark and Black Widow? If Gamora could be ""saved"" then the statement ""I tried everything, she cannot be brought back"" about Black Widow is just wrong. Tony stark, could've easily been saved as well, in the same way that Dr Strange won in his own movie, he could've let time restart until the best outcome was achieved.
3. The MCU quantum realm is worse than the DCU speed force. When I say that I mean, it's a term used whenever it would be too hard to actually explain a real way of working and throwing a fancy word in is just easier. Ant-Man felt the 5 years as 5 Hours in the original shrinking down, then all of the sudden 3 years could become 3 seconds, it's understandable if you could effectively pin point the location of a superhero and bring them back, this is something they could do perfectly, when Hawkeye went back in time he DIDN'T WANT TO come back to the future before seeing his daughter, he could however not avoid it, because Hulk had him tracked, so he was pulled back against his will, yet at the end of the film Captain America cannot be brought back and stayed in the past for an extra 40 years, because he wanted to, something that was proven impossible by Hawkeye.I feel like the writers felt ""the fans are retards, they just want to see their favorite heroes on a big screen"" and they were right for the most part, but some of us noticed, and we were offended by how little you think of us.",positive
"I don't live in America, so I never got my hands on all the amazing comics.
But even I, after all these years, knew things like that the next cap America would be this guy
The Cap America thing doing what he did, also comes from the comics and was hinted at earlier
This Thor is not the only thor :) that was known for a while too.
Yes, captain Marvel is marvelous... Everybody knows it by now that she could've done a lot of things on her own...
Would that've been fair to our other beloved characters? Not in my opinion.
What's with all the Ronin/Hawkeye/Barton hate?
He does have comics too you know :)They gave a lot of answers, it's not possible to please everybody :)Do a little research before you start bashing films.

"As the conclusion of the current MCU, it does a great job. Everything ties together well. Wouldn't be surprised if they had this whole movie script all but finalized 10 years ago. Even opened a few new possibilities of future story lines.
Mildly disappointed with how Captain Marvel was utilised.Aside from the MCU stuff; as an actual movie, I had far too many problems with it. From certain fight sequences, to one dimensional characters, to forced diversity, to pacing issues.TL;DR Great MCU conclusion, decent movie",positive
"It was normal movie but captain marvel ruined it. She was, very overpowered and she was strongest character. Adding her in this movie was very big mistake plot was coll tho but it wqs ruined by capitan marvel",negative
"This movie has everything. Comedy, action and tear at your heart strings. An all around superb movie. Absolutely well directed and the actors were bringing their A game. You have got to see this movie. If you saw Infinity War this movie is the icing on the cake.",positive
"It's the perfect conclusion to this story that began 11 years ago. An emotional sendoff to the heroes whom we grown up to. Thank you Marvel and all the actors, I can't wait to see what's coming next.",positive
"Everything about this movie is amazing, the time travel, the battle, everything!!! Iron Man and Natasha's death did hit me hard though but it was heroic!!! Love this movie!!!",positive
"Hawking used to say that everything has imperfections and our universe it self created by imperfections. BUT THIS MOVIE HAS NONE!
awesome!
Just awesome!",positive
"I thought the movie was good. As good as many of the others. They're always at least fun and a few were great.
This one is good but that's it. I think Avenger hysteria and hype is what's driving the super high ticket sales. Yes they had a billion dollar weekend but I wonder if it will slow down now.
I knew people who saw Titanic 2-3 times and a few up to 8 times when it came out. This is not one of those movies.",positive
"Endgame was a phenomenal movie it had so much emotion, jokes as usual and that final fight!!! That fight was incredible I love you 3000 marvel and I can't wait for what you're going to do in phase 4",positive
"I went to the cinema today to see this movie. I didn't want to wait for the dvd release. In my opinion Infinity War had some great moments and the ending was beautiful in its own way. I expected a movie as good as Infinity War or even better because of the many positive reviews. What I liked about this movie was that I couldn't predict the things that happened in the movie. But they didn't surprise me either. The time traveling stuff was interesting but not very overwhelming. The ending wasn't nearly as good as some people (including RDJ) were saying. All in all, I think that I should have waited for the DVD.",positive
The movie starts of with immediate heartbreak. The movie is well paced and edited. MVC (MOST VALUABLE CHARACTER) is captain ameirca. He stole the movie and it was more of an captain America movie. The movie does a good service to the 6 Og Avengers and doesnt leave a moment where your crying laughing or aweing. Its amazing.,positive
"This movie is great, don't get me wrong, but it just feels off especially since it chronologically comes after Infinity War which is just the Pinnacle of movie-making.I did not like that it didn't show much of the world after the Snappening and that they fixed it all by travelling through time. It didn't feel natural.TL;DR: Great movie but still a bit of a disappointment.",positive
Was well disappointed with this. I liked bits of it but I am finding difficulty recalling them.,negative
"Any Marvel fan would enjoy the movie no problem but having a sister who doesn't enjoy most movies and getting her to cry to a movie she doesn't know much about now that, that is an accomplishment my friend.The movie is literally for everyone all you have to do is have a little context and you'll fall in love with all the characters and you'll end up being back to their beginning listening to their story and becoming a true fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",positive
"Growing up on the MCU films has given me a connection to these characters that makes this movie amazing. My only problem with the movie was the step backwards they took with Thor from Ragnarok and Infinity War. But not A big enough issue to lower this from a 10. Well worth the 3 hours, doesn't feel long at all. In fact the pacing was pretty quick.",positive
"If you've not seen infinity war (which as a stand alone film is better then this) and a fair chunk of the other MCU films then you're gonna hate this. Yes there are plot holes, and a a couple of truly cringeworthy moments pandering to the feminists but overall its a wild ride, its refreshing that it wasn't 3 hours of constant battles (yes transformers I'm looking at you) that just get tedious. There is a story and character development.
The 3 hours shoots by, but, you really need to see quite a few of the other MCU films to appreciate it, its not a stand alone film and I'd imagine makes no sense at all without knowing the history - you have been warned!!",positive
"Just when all the fans and critics think Marvel can't make any better film than Infinity War, they prove us all wrong with this amazing flick. The 3rd act is absolute feast and do watch it in IMAX 3D. All the characters were extremely well written & performed. I literally cried in atleast 14 scenes. It was so emotional in some scenes. Do yourself a favour, and watch all of the 21 movies before to feel the emotional quotient.",positive
"First off, hats off to the Russo brothers, they have crafted something spectacular. Something that will be remembered for years. It isn't easy to make something like this. To culminate 11 years of movies, 21 films, and do it by tying things together, honoring the fans and most importantly honoring the characters. Yet the Russo's have pulled off just that. I've seen it twice now.Now before we get into the positives, let's get the nitpicks out of the way. (Don't worry I won't spoil anything). The movie isn't perfect, but is damn near close. Some aspects of the first act felt sort of rushed, but I suppose it was necessary in order for the film to touch on all the aspects it had to touch on. Even though the climax is absolutely mind blowing, there are some decisions they decided to make in regards to a character that I felt could have been written differently. At least that's what I was thinking while watching it, but the film's final moment made me forgive all of it. There are some other minor nitpicks here and there, but I'm not that kind of person, so let's get into the positives.Believe me, it's hard to discuss this movie without getting into spoilers, but I'll do my best. The first act is a little slow, but at no point did I feel bored(some people might, BUT NOT US). This act was necessary to establish the dire state of our heroes and of mankind in general following the events of Infinity war. This part of the film definitely focuses more on character development as well as drama. The film then really gets going, and my oh my were they successfull with the middle act. They did a great job of honoring everything that lead up to the endgame, and the comedy was perfectly sprinkled throughout. I won't say much more, as this review is already getting long. But I have to state again that this is an epic (and I mean EPIC) conclusion to the infinity saga. They make some bold decisions. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will definitely be satisfied. The whole theater clapped as the credits started rolling.What a film, check it out no matter what. Thank you Joe and Anthony Russo.",positive
End should have to be different ironman must have to live this may have disappointed the audience,positive
"*spoilers*This final massive movie in the massive MCU franchise reaches an end to the massive buildup after 22 movies, and is also the continuation/ending of the Infinity War movie. Obviously, the makers of this movie were given carte blanche to do whatever they like to the superheroes, since a few were killed off or forever changed in ways that cannot be recovered. I'll leave the plot to the Plot Summary section and review the good and bad elements of the movie (as opposed to the many overly-emotional reviews and votes here that see only black or white):Let's start with the time-travel, since most people seem to be having problems with it and it is the major plot point by which they try to fix what Thanos did in Infinity War. In fact, the writers did an interesting job making use of time-travel without it feeling like a cheat. They simply changed the rules of time-travel used in other movies in order to avoid the usual time paradoxes. This may feel like a cheat to some, but, obviously, nobody can claim to know how time travel could work. And if you pay attention, they stick to their own rules consistently, which is good.Here is the explanation for those that missed it: Timelines can be changed, but when they are changed, they split only for the people involved. I.e. You cannot go back in time and 'fix' the timeline for other people because those people would remain in that alternate timeline that you left behind. You can, however, change the timeline for yourself, and the past/future all proceed in the order by which you experience/d it. You can also change the timeline for the people in the past, but, once again, that would not affect the timeline that you left behind in the future.So, to make this clearer with examples, there are at least three timelines for the people in this movie: 1. The one we know according to the superheroes where Thanos wiped out 50% of all life. 2. The timeline for Thanos himself (and his friends) that has now been changed when he jumped forward in time. He didn't wipe out 50% in his timeline and he changed his mind and wanted to wipe out ALL of life this time after he saw how ineffective it was in one possible future. 3. The alternate timeline by the people in the past after Thanos jumped forward. Their timeline split and they experienced no Thanos!There is no problem with changing timelines. The only problem is that they needed to fix their own (#1) for the rest of the world, and going back in time would not do that. They needed to bring something from the past (the stones) in order fix the present timeline for everyone. The only reason Captain America had to go back to return the stones was so that alternate timeline #3 would not be wiped out without the stones. While he was there, he stayed there, which basically created his own personal alternate timeline that followed #1 with #3. All clear now?This new method of timelines achieves something important: It doesn't cheat by going back in time and undoing/changing it. It forces them to be creative and to do something in THIS timeline in order to fix the problem. Thus avoiding the typical cheat of time-travel.Now for the rest:Killing off Black Widow, Iron Man and Captain America (technically he wasn't killed but he lived his whole life elsewhere so he can't continue here and now in a sequel in this timeline so it's the same thing..): This was actually very good and brave. I wish they had done this sooner, then the superheros would actually feel more vulnerable and human. Iron Man gets a strong ending to his character arc and a touching send-off. Cap also gets strong character development here.The mixing of so many superheroes in one movie is bad for several reasons. First of all, it's like mixing fifty of your favorite foods together. They work nicely alone, but together, it becomes an overblown mess that doesn't work. Second, not all superheroes are fun for everyone. So mixing foods you do not like together with the good ones, will simply ruin the whole salad. Third, even with three hours, many of them are neglected.Hulk is ruined. Someone very misguided thought it would be clever to mix Banner and Hulk into one person. Except that the whole fun of Hulk was his uncontrolled fury and his split personality.Thanos became too powerful in this movie. I agree with this complaint. This is inconsistent with what we saw earlier.Captain Marvel has got to be the worst character by far in the MCU. Her personality has all the charm of an angry gnat, her obnoxious feminist attitude is toxic, and her super-powers are so badly defined, they can do anything and everything as needed. Unlimited and/or undefined super-powers are boring and are guaranteed to ruin any super-hero movie (which is why I also dislike Superman). Her presence in this movie almost ruins it completely but thankfully they used her as little as possible (probably because they realized how ridiculous her powers are). Most of the stars I removed were because of this character.They have increasingly made Thor into  the point of ridiculousness in a series of movies. And in this movie he has reached a peak of silly uselessness. It is kinda funny though so I don't hate it. But Thor fans will not be pleased.The final fight is a massive spectacle on one end, but so overblown and full of CGI it makes me yearn for the simpler superhero movies. The inclusion of the whole universe simply isn't as relatable as a local problem in one city. It's just too much. I enjoyed earlier simpler super-hero movies much more than this one.In summary: A mixed bag. It's good that they finally put an end to this overblown series of movies that have gone out of control. It's not anything close to a classic in my book, but it's difficult to ignore since it concludes the series and it does have lots of fun stuff despite its flaws.",positive

If you have been following the Marvel Franchise for a while now you will watch this movie and realize that this movie wraps up one of the most compelling storylines about superheroes we've ever seen in a very classy way. I don't think it is better than infinity War but it is by far the best way I can think off to end the Marvel's Avengers Franchise. Brilliant!,positive
1st hour and a half in I was ready for it toend so long and dragged out the last 30-45 mins made for good watching but that's it,negative
"This film is very, very great and is the end of 10 years of a series of superheroes. Thanks Marvel",positive
"This movie follows the other movies in the past of Marvel studios however Infinity WAr was better and has more well made story than this.
despite my feelings the movie is good but not perfect
by the way the movie shows at first the heroes broken to finally solved their problems",positive
First film to make me cry since home alone 4 on VHS in 2011,positive
A must watch film. An emotional rollercoaster filled with humour and emotions. End of a great era. Masterpiece of Marvel and Russo brothers. Kudos to them,positive
"I have never cried watching any kind of movie ever but Avengers Endgame touched me deeply in my heart. This movie is everything you want and more.
PS: There are no post credit scenes in this movie but pay respect to everyone who made this movie happen.",positive
"It was great even though I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending. Iron man could've stayed alive bcoz his iron man suit absorbed the power of the 5 stones so he could've been injured but didn't hv to die. Black widow dying I can deal with a bit. Cap America becoming and remaining old was stupid. They could've shown him old n told the story of him meeting his love again n then used Hulk's time machine to bring his young self back. But it malfunctioned n didn't work again. Sigh. The dialog was a bit much, all in all, but I guess it was necessary to some extent. I liked the movie and will watch it one more time at least, maybe more. Haha",positive
"Okay, so I saw this film yesterday and i was distinctly underwhelmed.
At three hours in length it seriously overstays it's welcome. It turns out there is only so much of people in spandex hitting each other that I can take.
At the end of the last movie, villain Thanos had snapped his fingers and killed half the worlds population.
Endgame picks up five years later with the sudden reappearance of Ant-man and his idea to use magic technology to travel back in time and gather up all the infinity stones so they can snap all the dead people back to life.
Even by comic-book standards that is a far fetched and really dumb plot.
So time travel means it's a literal greatest hits movie of previous marvel cannon movies. Although at times it felt too much like a cheesy clip show.
Far too many characters have to have their fifteen minutes of doing something which is why this film is easily an hour too long.
If you were looking for an original story you will be disappointed. Even the big battle finale is just a tired re-run of the ending of Avengers: Infinity War.
This is a really poor movie that misses most of it's forced attempts at both humour and pathos.
I genuinley do not understand the gushing great reviews this film is gettting.
It's a bit of a bloated mess.",positive
Best avengers series am gonna miss them everyone should watch this,positive
"That is not a self-serving review title. I rated the movie a 6 after reading a variety of reviews here on IMDb. The 1-star reviews are more poorly written than I've ever seen before, though I think that's because the Avengers have such a global fan base that more non-native English speakers are weighing in with their (well understood) disappointment, which is cool.I didn't have to read too many of the 9- or 10-star reviews beforehand because I was already committed to seeing this movie after Infinity War, and anyway I read some article on a news website about all the gushing, raving tweets from early Endgame viewers so I was actually fooled by the hype from a non-IMDb source for once. But, in retrospect, the 9's and 10's here appear to be mostly from the corporate shills and fan bois exactly as one would expect.So, I went to the middle of the pack of reviews and found a lot of really well thought out reviews in the 6- and 5-star range. Since there are already so many good reviews, I'll just pile on, buck-buck style, with some random musings...Was anyone else wondering why Ant-Man didn't call his daughter ""Peanut"" when he saw her again? To him it was only a little over 5 hours plus a day or two, but he still understood the vast amount of time elapsed in the main timeline. Either way, you'd think he'd still be using his pet name for her.OK, I have new respect for that scene in Iron Man 2 where Tony invented a new element (I think it was called ""triangulum""). You remember, when he used that giant monkey wrench to get his laser ring aligned? I always thought that was silly, but it took him an eternity compared to how quickly he solved the time travel conundrum in Endgame.Oh yeah, sorry for burying the lead... Infinity War was way better and I am quite certain that many film and MCU fans will just consider it to be the end of the series. I think I might be doing that right now as I type.Hahahahahaha. Sorry, I am just laughing thinking about how pointless Captain Marvel's movie was. They shoehorned it in at the end of the series, right before Endgame, and it was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the narrative.Solo movie or not, Captain Marvel's brief ex machina appearances at the beginning and end of Endgame could not have made any less sense or been any more of a cop-out. On the other hand, I fell for the Captain Marvel hype machine also, so I guess Disney has the last laugh (and my ticket money).OK, I admit, I really liked Captain America's hammer-wielding moment - it's definitely my favorite part of the movie. That was his version of Wonder Woman's ""No-Man's Land"" scene. I guess it didn't hit me until reading all the reviews afterward that this cool moment came at the expense of Thor's reputation (i.e. that's why he had to be fat and mostly useless for the entire movie, just to set up that scene). I can see why Thor fans are enraged.Ummmmm.... really? Send the two most human and normal Avengers out to get the most outer-spacey and scary Infinity stone? Yeah, right.Since Hulk usually ruins most of the movies he's in, I'm actually glad he was a Banner hybrid for the entire movie. Really, Thanos should have dusted him and left Peter Parker, but I guess we needed somebody really lovable to be dusted in order to make us care about Endgame.Dang, the Hollywood pecking order is tough! Bradley Cooper rates higher than that Peter Quill guy, even in cartoon raccoon form. I know, Taylor, I can't do that - mix actors with characters - but I can't remember Star Lord's name. Oh yeah, Chris Pratt. I only remember from tabloid articles about his love life. To be fair, I guess Rocket really is the most entertaining of the GotG so it makes sense he gets the rabbit's share of Endgame screen time.Hahahahaha. Sorry, I'm just laughing again remembering how the Winter Soldier always brings his high-capacity assault rifle to all the epic battles between gods, hulks, titans, space aliens, laser plasma metal jet suits, meta-humans, etc. It seems pretty effective though. He should be the official Avenger of the NRA.Was it me, or was it way too easy for Thor and Rocket to get their Infinity stone? If you're going to send the Avengers off on 3 side quests, at least try to keep them balanced! Then again, Infinity War made me want to go back and watch Ragnarok and Dr. Strange; Ragnarok and Endgame now made me need to go back and watch The Dark World, and so on, and so on...Endgame proves that there is absolutely nothing - nothing - that Hawkeye can do to make him seem like a legit Avenger. I'm sorry, he just doesn't fit in with the rest of the heroes. I don't know what it is, he just doesn't.If you're going to mock other time-travel movies' ""rules"", you better come correct with your own. Endgame definitely does not do this. I haven't seen one movie so unfairly diss other movies since Harold & Kumar went to Guantanamo and dissed Eurotrip.I'm sorry. Iron Man has survived a lot of blasts before. I think he could have survived the Infinity Gauntlet snap.I get that it's a big Marvel movie thing for the heroes to run around without their helmets/masks on way too often so you feel a big personal connection with them rather than thinking you're watching a cartoon (spoiler alert - these movies all seem like cartoons anyway), but this went over the top in Endgame.Captain Marvel out in space and ripping through Thanos' ship without her helmet? Iron Man and War Machine running around without headgear? Come on, it's just stupid and reckless - and it cost Tony Stark his life!Since Chris Evans upgraded from Johnny Storm to Captain America, I think it's completely fair that Anthony Mackie gets an upgrade from Falcon to New Cap. He has a nicely trimmed beard. But he damn sure better take some of that super-soldier serum to keep it real.I can't remember what other movie made me cry this much. I think there was one. Interstellar? Maybe. Infinity War? No, I don't think so, I think it had only two tear-jerking scenes, Endgame had three or four, I lost track.Endgame is a huge letdown compared to Infinity War. It's at least 30-45 minutes too long, has an uneven pace, way too little comic book action, and it contains lots of stuff to make certain characters' fans really mad.Even so, I think the best reviews are still in the 5- to 6-star range because even the disappointed fans realize what an impossible task it was to try to wrap up the story after Infinity War. The producers and directors at least gave it a shot, even if they missed the mark. Maybe not even Hawkeye himself could have hit that target.",positive
"I will write this review as a way to unload how frustrated I feel after watching this movie.First and foremost, Tony Stark's plan to bring everyone back after a 5 year gap is absurd and selfish. After 5 years you should be able to balance the choice of leaving everything as it is OR going back and changing everything back to how it was. Keep in mind 5 years is a very long time to have been pronounced dead. The paperwork to bring these people back into the system and the burden they will now be on the economy and Social Security, at least for a while, would be enough to bankrupt a nation. Conveniently, all MCU's family and friends were either fine or they had all vanished together so having them come back unharmed, albeit 5 years later, is a relief. That is not likely the case for the rest of the world though. Most of the people coming back are coming back to a drastically changed world. Most will be homeless, they have no jobs, no way of getting a job, not soon enough, anyway. Some will have lost family members and beloved pets during that time, to old age, suicide, accidents and all sorts of natural causes. And some, if not most, will be coming back to a world that moved on without them. Their loved ones may have already found others or have been changed so drastically that they're strangers now. If you watched Tom Hank's ""Cast Away"" and recall his hopelessness after coming back to life to find his house sold, his insurance cashed, his job taken, his industry changed, his wife remarried... Now multiply that by half of the Universe's life forms and you have an unmitigated tragedy of cosmic proportions. All so that Tony gets to keep his 4-year-old?
No. Tony Stark's toughest choice should have been that. Am I willing to sacrifice my daughter to save half the life in the Universe? After that, snapping your fingers knowing you will die should be a piece of cake.And then the time travel ordeal... If the operating theory is that you cannot change the past then you should be unable to change the past, PERIOD. The only things that can happen are the things that have already happened. In that scenario, it is plausible to assume you'll be able to go back in time, steal the Infinity Stones unnoticed and then but them back... But all of this is only possible IF they have already happened. Complicated yet theoretically possible. You can even justify Thor's conversation with his mom or the Ancient One's chat with Banner because we were unaware that these things had already happened then, even if it is our first time seeing it. But then you have the Cap fighting with himself and telling other's he's with Hydra, Loki's escape and the cap moving back to the past to grow old together with his long lost love. You could argue that the Cap made himself forget the fight with the scepter and lived secretly in a basement for the rest of his life, but REALLY? And what about all the undercover Hydra operatives that will soon find that the Cap is not really on their side and hence must know of their own involvement and what about Loki? How was he still a prisoner for the end scene in Avengers when Thor escorts him back to Assgard and where he is later seen in prison? And how are we reconstructing the Tesarract and putting the Ether back into Natalie Portman? Or CAN you change the past after all? So why not do the unthinkable and kill one baby (Thanos) to save half the Universe? Send Hawkeye and Black Widow to do it. Why not travel in time to beat Thanos at Wakanda, now with the help of the entire team, including all of the dispersed heroes and Captain Marvel? Or did we just create 6 different alternate realities and timelines but somehow feel good about our victory in just this one? And is the Cap comfortable going back to 1945, hanging his shield and watching history unfold without altering a single thing, knowing full well all the lives he could've saved (think Vietnam, Kennedy, 9/11, etc.)?And how does every single main character survive the final battle? They blew the Avengers headquarters to smithereens yet they're all somehow unscathed sub-level 20, just brushing off the dust. Or when Thanos made it rain fire? I get some are meta-humans but others have latex suits and some body armor, nothing more. How are there not more casualties?I could've lived with Thor's beer-belly, the new Hulk and the rest of the idiotic jokes if the movie itself weren't a joke already. The logic seems off and I am just thinking about this now. These people had 10 years to write a better story. The movie was made painfully long because of gaping plot holes rather than by great writing.",negative
"After this we could all learn a few thing about quantum mechanic.
Poor Thanos! In one moment I felt like it is unfair match up. So many of them and so few of his man. That's what you get when you mess with the humans of the planet earth.
I would really like to avoid spoiling because this is something you just need to see to believe. Most epic battle in the history of superhero movies and series.
Twisted and tangled story line which you must carefully follow from the beginning to the end. Story that sums up this whole franchise, this masterpiece of Marvel's story telling. They took us on an amazing journey and reminded us on many great moments from previous movies.
You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer and applause, you will ask yourself what now, sitting there waiting for the post credits scene just to realize there is no one because 'Part of the Journey is the End'!",positive
"Loved the movie!! Amazing ending to this entire phase. Just don't want anyone to forget that this entire franchise is a rip-off of DC Comics... Thanos = Darkseid. Captain America = Superman. Avengers = Justice League. Etc, etc, etc. DC will always be first/best above Marvel. Only difference is that DC execs have lacked any vision since they ripped off Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster so many years ago. Get your act together WB/DC.!!!!",positive
"Either bitter DC fans or people with short attention spans seem to be dissing this magnificent film. In order to get the most from Endgame it really does require you to have seen most of the previous MCU films. It's emotional payoff is probably the most rewarding of any film I have ever seen. It's funny, it's sad, it's exciting at the same time. It's not perfect, no film is. Perfection doesn't exist. It's an unattainable construct. However I truly feel it is the best possible version of the final chapter of the MCU any fan could have asked for. Nuff said.",positive

"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a culmination of the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which started with ""Iron Man"" in 2008. After Thanos wiped out half the universe in the 2018 film ""Avengers: Infinity War"", the Avengers intend on finding him to undo what had been done, only to discover that Thanos used the stones to destroy the stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes the quantum realm, and after meeting up with the remaining Avengers, he explains that the five years for them was five hours for him, so he comes up with a plan on how they could use the quantum realm to go back in time and get the infinity stones. With the help of Tony Stark, a quantum tunnel and matching quantum realm suits, the Avengers go back in time to 2012, 2013, and 2014 to get the infinity stones. Though the Thanos of 2014 finds out about this, and with the help of the 2014 Nebula, he is brought back to the present to use the stones to ensure half the universe is wiped out after Bruce Banner used the stones to resurrect the fallen half. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is an extremely satisfying, enjoyable film that definitely feels like the end to the Infinity Saga. The film itself is emotionally driven, has great visual effects, even better acting, and an amazing soundtrack composed by Alan Silvestri. I and many fans are excited for the future of the MCU, especially after such an amazing film.",positive
"After watching the movie, I'm actually glad it's all over. A massive build up and so many MCU die-hard fans oversold it. Don't get me wrong, I liked the Marvel movies in general. But after SOOOOOOOO many of them I'm over it - and this movie didn't really help that. There was nothing new here: the same cliched lines, the same tears and long stares and fancy speeches, the same rivalries started and finished and referred to with a gentle (yet sickening) smile... You get the idea. It was good, but in a boring, ""I've seen this before"" kind of way.
I truly hope this is the end of these massive big production movies for a while.",positive
"I really liked this movie, but i have to say that Infinity War was a bit better than this. Only because infinity war had more memorable moments.
But the memorable moments in here do pack a serious punch.
I don't understand why people are hating on the way Marvel changed Thor, I find it understandable, and Thor still shines as a god in the end.
Also surprised by the ammount of casualties and the characters who died.
And the final battle feels like Ready Player One, and that is definitely a good thing.
The humor is there, and i teared up once.
overall, i would definitely go see it a second time.",positive

Would lnt say disappointed at all, but simple things that would ha e made the movie that little bit sweeter.Although this movie was EMENSE!",positive
"This was nearly perfect. Trust me. It is the best film the MCU has to offer so far. As a fan of the franchise for nearly a decade (around two-thirds of my life, I am 12), it really left me satisfied with the conclusion of the stories I've been following for most of my life. I still remember my obsession with Iron Man 2 and Captain America: The First Avenger (primarily the latter) when they first came out when I was very young.All the storylines I've been following for the better part of my entire life so far getting wrapped up (for the most part) really put a smile on my face. Infinity War was one of my favorite movies when it came out. I was mesmerized by the amount of material packed into those two and a half hours of runtime, but Endgame put all that to shame. The three hours of runtime gave the movie a lot of leeway with the plot, and it put all that to good use. It almost felt like two or three movies packed into one.It does have a few flaws, however (although not severe enough to remove a star). A lot of different things were happening at once, leaving me somewhat discombobulated, although not too much. I won't dock any stars because of this, however, as the ending more than made up for it and some of my discombobulation may be accredited to the loud (yet admittedly fun) theater (as me and my friends were watching the first screening in the whole city).Overall, I'd say this is a ten from me. You'd be doing yourself a favor if you watch this, even if you haven't watched any of the prior movies (even more so if you have watched even only just a few of them).",positive
Didn't think they would beat Infinity War but man they did. By far THE GREATEST MARVEL FILM EVER MADE.,positive
"Endgame was basically the perfect end to years worth of movies. Great scenes that gave goosebumps, funny scenes that gave laughs and the Thor, Cap vs Thanks fight was worth admission prices Alone",positive
"This film has it all, action, laughs and the occasional tear. There is very little to complain about this very well though out end to the Avengers series.",positive
Marvel Avengers Endgame is a combination of 10 years of Film making. It is viewed by many critics as been a top film of the year. Went to see it for Tom Vaughan Lawler as he is a great Irish actor. We see ups and downs. Like most comic book movies it falls flat in the final third of the film. If you are taking your kids to see it don't three hours is a lot for children and trust me they won't sit still. To conclude Endgame is the Endgame for cinematic crossovers possibly,positive
"It is a precious movie with a gratifying ending. This time the revenge is complex and the plot is interblended, almost outsizing any of its previous installments. It witty, amusing, thrilling, nostalgic (prepare to cry), charging and glorious. That's how an epic is concluded.",positive
"I thought Endgame was a good movie. Not awesome, or amazing or anything else. Just good. I liked it but didn't love it. And I thought it was a little too over hyped and overrated. In my opinion, it is not the best Super hero Marvel movie ever. It starts off a bit slow. Not a whole lot of action in the first half of the movie. It does have some funny moments and when the action kicks in, it is great but about the same as I've seen in other Marvel movies. There are some surprises but I didn't cry 5 or 6 times like some have claimed they did. The biggest surprise is the ending which is a shocker and a tearjerker. I did cry at the end as I'm sure everyone else did and will. No spoilers.
I can't help but think that if Endgame was a DC movie, I don't think Marvel fans would have given it such rave reviews. Although I have seen some Marvel fans review it too, and they didn't like it as much either. At the viewing I attended, I could tell it had mixed reactions. There was some applause at the end but others, like me, just seemed a little disappointed.
Well, everyone has their own opinion. You will either love it or not. Regardless, Endgame is still the movie of the year and will be the top box office gross for a long time.",positive
The worst of all the avengers sequence. Boring apart from some cool action scenes. Stupid scene when CA lifts thor's hammer wtf. Also we were expecting Dr Strange to show his real powers and see him more in the movie as he is the most powerful,negative

"Assemble for Marvel's latest triumph encompassing a vivid story, grand style, striking visuals and overwhelming heart.It is unbelievably difficult to give a full-blown rating without spoiling anything, but all I will say is it has surpassed my expectations. I can't recall the last time I felt this way about a film since perhaps the Lord of the Rings or the Dark Knight films. And after 11 long years, the Infinity Saga is now complete.This is where an era ends, and begins anew with what appears to be a brilliant future. The only concern I have is just how high each new MCU film will have to jump after a this film has set the bar so high. A fitting end to an enduring saga.Stan would be proud.",positive

Although there are some plot holes in the movie the epic scale of the whole thing holds it up. The last 50 minutes of this movie is the best thing marvel has ever done,positive
Following all the hype about this film went along with great expectations - Film had good characters and storyline but failed to live up to my expectations - Great film for the children but not a 10/10 film,positive
I am in love with this film completely. The whole film left me completely depressed but satisfied with the ending,positive
"Unfortunately, this movie was not as good as everyone said neither is as good, the only good part is the last 3rd and even then it is a bland super-hero movie. It is neither terrible nor amazing, it's just above average and would be below average if my least-favourite ""hero"" (Black Widow) dies. The hype surrounding this movie was understandable but wasn't lived up to. The time travel is contradictory and stupid, on par with Looper's time travel, i cannot say how utterly bored i was during this mildly ok but contrived movie more. Overall it was ok, with good action, effects and production but the rest was lacklustre at worst and mediocre at best.
Just my opinion though.",positive
"Just in few words:
You go to the film thinking it will be even better then infinty war and thor ragnarok ! Both were great, heroic and very entertaining!
But here is what you get from 3 hours of watching:
Thor ""god of thunder"" who almost killed thanos n th last movie : a chubby, ruined, drunk addicted man ! His storm breaker can't affect thanos that much!The Hulk : he was afraid and hide last movie so you expect his super comeback with a massive ragging revenge : turned into brucebanner attitude with a zero readyness to any fight and even hurt his arm during the film ... well, the character ruined ...no hulk!Iron man :dissapointed and look like a sick man all of the film ! Then died at the end !Captain marvel : the beauty superman of the mcu ... the unstoppable, the proud , well the one we saw a week before in her own film doing miracles and it was clear the she will save the day and lead the attack in endgame ! When all ruined in infinty war nick fury sent her a message just before he vanished .. it was like ""well if things reached that level we should summon the super girl .. so what we got at end game: no rule at all , didn't show up for most of the movie , then when showed up she did nothing important , nothing big .. well captain america did better than her I cannot understand how! Even her good look , she cut her hair boy like !!Well what was left in the movie?! The real super characters were Hawkai and captain America who should be by far weaker than the above heros and thean thanos of course !!Final word i watched the movie and asked where are the avengers?!",negative

"The first hour is too slow and a bit too melodramatic, rather wasteful and boring. The second hour raise it a bit, still not exciting enough though. The final hour is finally where endgame really picks up, and the ending was done nicely as a closure to a great Marvel-eous cinematic journey. It does leave some leads to possible continuation for some of its characters, mainly for Guardians of the Galaxy 3.",positive
"The movie was very fitting for the ending of a phenomenal 10 years MCU run. But I must admit that I didn't like the ending. The ending didn't leave me happy. My favorite character is Iron Man and like always Iron Man is forever the hero. However, he was the hero with a sad ending. 🙁
I am unable to watch this a second time.",positive
"What do you get when you use cheap plot twists and rely on the worst character in the Marvel movie universe to sum up the effort of millions of hours, passion and execution? This dumb ending. It would have been better to leave it with half the universe dead than to create this tripe. Just one person's opinion. So many irrational elements, it isn't worth explaining to those without an iota of sense. It's Hollyweird's salute to the inane world they think we all want to live in.",positive
"This movie was TERRIBLE. First off there was NO reason for the movie to be three to four hours long... I think that was part of the strategy honestly make you think its so epic it had to be a nearly 4 hour movie.90% of the movie is just acting, trying to figure out getting the team back together, or undoing what has been done. Outside of one little battle at the end there is virtually no action in the movie at all. Additionally the action you've seen has already been seen in other movies.This is a franchise that does indeed need a complete reboot. This movie shows you how old and tired it really is. People will see it because they want to see how things end and honestly I have to give credit to the powers that be here... unlike DC they have slow cooked this movie over a decade.Iron Man is making his what 100th appearance LOL.This movie is going to be shoveled tons of money because of over hype, and because apparently its the end of the road for this group of actors.I must say however I'd hate to see anyone else playing Thor and again I'd like to see more Thor movies but that's about it.Scrub out the hype, and the franchise and tell me honestly was this movie a GREAT stand alone film? NOPE!They stretched this thing out for every single dollar. Nothing new to see here I'd skip even though you wont.",negative
"Wow. Simple and pure. I started this journey watching Iron Man 1 back in 2008, and left the cinema thinking finally, a super hero movie done right. Reflecting everything I loved about comics and enabling me to relive my childhood on the big screen. 11 years later Marvel brings out the endgame. A beautiful conclusion and tribute to what has been a joy for me to be partake over the past 22 movies. Given the sheer amount of characters in the mcu, they have done brilliantly giving every one heroic screen time and really embracing each of the characters as best as possible. I was in tears at the end. Not out of sadness but out of pure gratefulness and joy of having experienced this journey. Endgame is a masterpiece in terms of entertainment and concludes this generation of heroes in the most appropriate way possible. This was the star wars of my generation and honestly I can't help feel a tinge of sadness of how things turned out in the end, but simultaneously so grateful and content with how it was done. All in all, I just wanted to say Thank you. Thank you for making an incredible series of movies and really doing justice to my childhood and to the marvel universe. Avengers....Assemble",positive
"The movie is amazing. I never thought they would ve able to surpass their own amazing job with Infinity War but they did. Where the movie truly shine is in its third act, it is just beautiful. I felt like a little kid watching the whole thing. Simply astonishing.",positive
"I can't remember a film that not only lives up to the media hype but blows it out the water. It's truly amazing the plot is solid, the humour is there, but also evokes real emotions. Thank you Marvel you a fitting end...",positive
Simply amazing. Best of the marvel films by far. Great creative writing.,positive
"THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIMES !I was sad, happy, angry, calm, I am glad I bought the tickets 2 weeks earlier!!",positive
Spectacular film. Spectacular performances. Not just a great superhero movie but a great movie all round. The Russo's smashed it.,positive
"Please, of you listen to people saying that this movie ain't good...listen to them. They're right. I give 6 because to me under 6 is unwatchable. So, it's 6 because i just watch. No emotions about it. The plot is absurd and with many gaps. It's deus ex machina for real.",positive
"I know this is different from marvel END GAME, LORD OF THE RINGS FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.
You only see maybe like 30-40 seconds of a large scale battle with this large scale of a train rolling battle in the end game is way better then fellowship of the ring.",positive
"The final installment of the the Avengers was a good and entertaining ending to the series. While the plot line was predictable for the most part, there were enough plot twists to keep you entertained. CGI is first rate and there is plenty of ""eye candy"" in this regard. Pretty much what you would expected from this type of film and Marvel. Those that like the MCU are likely to ""love"" this installment. While I enjoy these films, I didn't think EndGame was ""awesome"" but definitely a movie I would watch again.Character's stayed within their expected lanes so to speak with some differences with a few of them (will leave them out here to prevent spoilers). I would have preferred to keep all the Marvel characters in their lanes. While this was annoying at time, it was didn't distract too much from the film. I also would have liked to have seen more of Captain Marvel but she was brought in a the correct times to support the story. Just not a major part of it.Again, if you like the MCU or the DCU, you will like this one. If you are more into strong plot lines and characters, you might like this one.",positive
"Nope. If your into mindless garbage this is for you. Seen the death of Iron man coming for the past five years. literally been telling my girlfriend to prepare for it for the past five years because marvel is just so damn predictable. Thanks for proving me right guys. plus it's the same 4 storylines for EVERY movie. Very tiring. Only reason I went is because my girlfriend is a marvel fan.
You might say I'm a little biased since I'm DC all the way but I still enjoy a good superhero story no matter who makes it. Also, time travel all of a sudden? Fat Thor? Come on guys. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is cause of Jeremy Renner. Great performance. And the graphics were good. Except Thanos. Still looks like he was hand drawn in at the last minute. Just like in infinity. Check it out. You might like it. Probably will cause the general public disagrees with me and falls for this crap time and time again but me? Just nope",negative
This film just contains so many great moments that you need to see for yourself. It provides emotional gut wrenching moments and hilarious moments. It is also the perfect way to bring together 11 years of MCU movies,positive
"Their won't be no more waiting for the greatest fans in the world including me...whoever comes and goes those actors character will always remembered in our heart...this movie made us laugh, cry and more than that showed us how to love a movie... Whatever we think that's gonna happen in this movie just the opposite will be showcased...this film is outstanding the final scenes in this movie is mind-blowing... Just enjoy.. No words to describe... Chris Evans (Captain America) and Robert Downey Jr. (Iron man) love u beyond this film..thank uuuu...",positive
"There is a problem with returning the stones to their original time in order to maintain the same timeline. Thanos would still be alive, and on the same mission. That would throw them into an endless loop with no happy ending. It was still fun to watch.",positive
"Some scenes could have been edited down a bit.. But why NOT make it EPIC, with one more joke or two?
Also, would have like more from certain characters and less of others. More action would always have been nice too.
But when all was said and done, this movie going experience was just about as good as it gets... IF your a Marvel fan, and have been following it. If not then it wasn't made for you YET, go catch up and watch the last phase. Amazing Time!
Impressive acting caught me by surprise too. And the pay offs are great fun.",positive
Such great movie with just amount of ingredents. Sad that there won't be anymore. At least now we have amazing 6 hours long movie to watch over and over again.,positive
I genuinely respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its great conclusion. 3 hours of visual treat i must say. Going with 9/10,positive
Paltrow and Downey are the two most insipid actors on the planet. No matter the role they play it the same. Banal. Wooden. Worthless. Arrogant. Boring. I can only imagine how much better the films they disgraced would have been with real talent.,positive
Easily the best franchise in history. Taking 22 different chapters of one amazing story and cramming it into one concise ending. This movie could have lasted 5 or 6 hours easily and Anthony and Joe Russo managed to squeeze it down into 3 hours. Amazing.,positive
"Ok film, but seems more lika a nostagia train back ten years rather than adding anything new.
I loved the first Avengers, it had the right mix of action, humour, interesting characters and sstory. This however was a lot of repetiton. If anything it had almost to much resemlenst to Infinity War and didn't add much new. Some scenes just seemed like copy paste, and some of the backtracking seemed unesseary.
The acting was great, the characters are great. The movie held my interest but I wouldn't call it a masterpeice.It was a nice finish to the lineup of movies we have gotten from the MCU the latest 10 years, and I do look forward to seeing more of them.
But as always there are some plotholes that you can't really get past. The fact that noone noticed that Nebula is missing, including her partner who was right infront of her before teleportation. Had they just spent one single minute looking for her they would have noticed she was picked up by Thanos and had been prepared for the entire 3rd act.
The idea that haweye should run the infinity stones into battle with several thousend of Thanos warriors was another thing. Why not keep them safe as far back as possible, call in anyone of the Avengers with some actual skill to keep a sheild around them.
Same with the car, instead of tossing the glove like an american football so that all characters could have their 5 minutes of screentime in the end battle was just dumb, have Strange open up a portal under the car and transport it to the building. Scott, Hope and Shori could work on it, Thor could use his lighning to power it up.
And at the end, the final straw was to watch Tony die from the damages, when Strange could just use the stone right in fron of him to rewind time. He has done it to an apple, so why not save Tony Stark.Theese little things makes the film less enjoyable that it could have been. But it's still a good film and an obvious must for anyone who has seen the others.",positive
Definitely the end of an era...Figure the studio will reboot at this point.,negative
"This is the best finale to a saga. There are infinite cool references from the start to the end through dialogues, music, costume, sets, e.t.c. The time traveling sequence was clever and so was the intial first hour which dwells on the emotional complexity of the characters. The final hour battle was intentionally fast paced and rushed for targeting multiple viewings. There is no more scene in the history of cinema more classy and massy than portals.",positive
"I don't know why this film is getting one out of tens. I've seen films that are far worse than infinity war and the have scored nines and tens, have you people no sense of taste? Anyway for me I enjoyed this film, I will agree it's not perfect but the pace of the story, the final battle scene and some of the characters stories concluding it tied up the infinity saga well. There were some great comedy moments as well as some emotional fair wells. It didn't feel like three hours as it was entertaining, don't watch with all the hype watch with an open mind as a marvel fan and you will enjoy this film.",positive
"This movie is all that is expected and more.Without saying more to spoil it, it brings the audiences through all the emotions above.I would recommend you go watch it.",positive
This movie is the greatest movie I have ever seen so far. The greatest conclusion we can get for marvel and a wonderful warp up for the infinity saga. I mean so parts of the movie were a bit iffy but overall this is a great movie. I give it a 9.2/10,positive
"... if you were a real marvel fanThis endgame is a masterpiece, really what true fans want from this franchise and really entertaining, only wished it was longer!!Everything from acting, story, fight scenes, suspense, twists etc. It's all up to my expectations and to what I am looking to see when I go to the movies to watch the MCUI watched this before it even airs worldwide as I have won a avant-premiere ticket, it surely was worth it and I am proud to be one of the firsts that have watched the movie before it airs!I just wish there was more!",positive
"It's not like infinity wars, but not less engaging :)",positive
"We were never going to see something radical at this stage.
it's a very entertaining move but it's not as good as Infinity War ( or Thor Ragnarok).
As the summation of a long story arc it works well enough. But there are so many characters here that it's impossible to give anyone real depth. Most appear as cameos more or less. The one thing i felt at the end was that it was over stuffed. The last battle which aims at total spectacle suffers from this surfeit of characters. There were a few occasions in the film where i felt like i had missed something. Particularly the introduction of Captain Marvel. I haven't seen the standalone so maybe i am missing a chunk. She just seemed to come out of nowhere and seemed out of place. And the Hulk stuff was off for me ( the protracted 'selfie' scene is a good example'). The treatment of the Hulk character was also a bit of a fail in the Infinity War movie imo. Thor has a beer belly and is an alcoholic? that was a fail for me. Where did that beer-belly go?
Some of the humor is a little off in places although the new 'Banner Hulk' trying to get into character in the jaunt to New York was very funny and naturalistic.
Infinity War also had a great focus on the Thanos character whereas here he gets very little time and regressed to a pretty standard comic book villain.
All that being said, there was a need to have resolution ( as i understand it) and it would have been failing if it didn't try to please as many as possible. it's a hard film to overly criticize. It's a comic book superhero movie. Just not a truly great one. As a resolution it does it's job. Oh, and the visuals are fantastic : )",positive
"'Avengers: Endgame' is a film that manages to serve the 21 MCU films before it in a way that is almost magical, and near perfect. The film does a wonderful job at tying up and concluding so many storylines that have been present throughout the last 11 years and 22 films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film manages to out-do itself and delivers on absolutely gigantic and epic proportions. While the film isn't perfect and there are some slight gripes and nitpicks I definitely have, it is perfectly satisfying in the way it manages to close itself up. 'Endgame' offers a justifiable conclusion that can best be described as epic.",positive
"The plot holes in Endgame can't be denied.
I mean come on, how far away from earth were Tony and Nebula when they ran out of food, water and air. Then Capt. Marvel gets them and their ship home all safe and well. Must have been in Earths orbit by that stage, just calculating re-entry while blacking out.
Many lengthy scenes of nothingness, and then many unexplained scenes of action/importance.
Thor (my favorite character) ended Infinity War and started Endgame as the supremely powerful god of thunder, then turns into a pathetic (not brooding, but blubbering) mess which he doesn't fully recover from by the end of the movie. And apparently Stormbreaker lost its mojo too.
Hulk is essentially a no show as well.
Ant Man is still defying the physics laid out in the first Ant Man movie.
14M+ possibilities of the future, and only one works? But Dr Strange can't tell anyone, or it won't happen! So every problem they encounter or cause is the exact right thing to do?
Everyone snapped back into existence after 5 years, and just go on with their lives like nothing happened. Apparently the entire world just stopped, awaiting their return, or everyone at that school got held back 5 years.
Oh, don't forget to look out for the strangely setup all female mini battle in the final fight scene, that was just weird.",positive
"A fat overweight Thor throughout the film, a rat walking across by chance a device to bring Ant man back, weak storyline, weak battle, did Dr strange know all along? Was he the real hero? As soon as you got suspense.....safety was round the corner !!!!Just rubbish",negative
"In 2008 with Robert Downey Jr Iron man was released, this was when the soon to be called ""the backbone of the MCU"" if Iron man would have failed at Box office or with Viewers, there would be no MCU. Now look where we are, At the final chapter in the ""Infinity saga"" this proves that The MCU has made it! Now Avengers Endgame itself was perfect, it was everything a conclusion should be, It wrapped up every story arc, it had a way to represent memories and old times, not to mention the great visuals and sound editing! I'd say it was a perfect 10 for me, mainly because it wasn't a jumbled up mess, it actually had a focused story!",positive
"I wasn't a big fan of marvel movies but when I watched infinity war and Thor Ragnarok, it caught my attention. After watching those two movies I thought it wouldn't be that good but it was amazing 100 times better than I expected",positive
"This heartbreaking yet beautiful and satisfying work of art is a truly great end to the Marvel universe's 3rd phase and I would still be satisfied if it were the end of the Marvel universe altogether. It is a visually stunning, masterfully written and delicately polished story of a battle against a god. I think the performances were the best of the MCU and multiple scenes almpst had me crying. The comedy doesn't feel out of place and the pacing is near perfect, especially for a 3 hour film. This film will be remembered for generations to come, so if you havent seen it - be one the first generations to do so.",positive
"Thank you MARVEL studios for the 10 years of journey. The movie was brilliant and mind-blowing. 3 Hours felt like nothing. I only watch any movies once in the cinema, but this one, I wouldn't mind to watch it a couple more times. Will watch it again this weekend. The best movie I've ever watch in my whole life. Go and grab your tickets now, you wont regret it.",positive
"I enjoyed the film and there was a good mix of comedy, emotion and action. I get why some have said they were a little disappointed, but many are breaking the events down far too literally, I mean it is fiction guys.....Films like this rarely live up to the hype and this one could do with being 20 mins or so shorter.",positive
"This is not sequel of Infinity war. This is the end of all 21 movies. I'm so happy to watch this movie, and all MCU movies from 10 years ago. thank you all.",positive
"So lots of people say this is the best Marvel movie, as many fans of the mcu I was really hyped to see 'End Game' after 'Infinity war' but yes, I got disappointed by the not nearly as good as Infinity war story line. The acting again is great but the movie is just to long and there are many plot wholes. If you've liked Infinity war, you'll like this movie too but it's just not nearly as good as Infinity war. The first 2 hours feel like a never ending story but the end is alright especially the last battle saved this movie for me.",positive
"You did???Great me to!!!!I mean WOW! Just wow. Great movie. Ticks all the boxes.Look if your reading or indeed writing the bad reviews.. just stop. Stop right now. Some people woke up yesterday excited to watch the biggest film in history, and others woke up with the same excitement for another chance to whine and moan. Nothing will be good enough..... we all know the type.I had plenty of theories about how the film would pan out. They were blown out of the window within 20 minutes. It kept me guessing, laughing, and on the edge of my seat, maybe the odd tear here and there!Any real Avengers fan is gonna love this movie. Fact!! I just cannot see why you wouldn't.. unless your a born spoilt brat!!If you didn't like this movie... ask yourself why? To be different? To ""cool""? Because you hate superhero movies and you was dragged to the cinema by your partner or friend and you actually wanted to see Pet Cemetery? That's maybe understandable, maybe!! But do not say your a Avengers fan and not like this movie.Sorry I think I'm still hyped up from the movie!!If you haven't seen it i am jealous- Enjoy! Have fun!",positive
"I loved Infinity War and I honestly couldn't wait for Endgame but I came out of the cinema feeling underwhelmed. I expected so much from this movie, the critic reviews made it sound like it was everything us fans wanted from the finale but it just wasn't.The fat Thor joke got old quickly. The Hulk was disappointing, the film would have worked just as well without him being in it, even in the final fight scene.I did think the Hawkeye and Black Widow scene was filmed and written very well but not much of a fuss was made about Black Widow dying! Where was her funeral??Really the film is all about Captain America and Iron Man. Too much screen time given to these characters. Would have liked to have seen a longer battle scene and more of those who had previously been turned to dust.",positive
"Comedic, emotional, action packed...... this movie was honestly fun to watch, but for a movie that was supposed to give closure to the many build up movies preceding it, it was ultimately disappointing.there are many flaws to the movie, but the greatest two in my opinion was Thanos and Captain Marvel.starting with captain marvel i think she was a mistake to the franchise. first she is ridiculously powerful, the problem with this is that in endgame they had to nerf and buff her across the movie, for example she is able to completely run through space ships but is not able to beat thanos. Also her strength kind of under-means the importance of the rest of the avengers.As for thanos, he had amazing character build up and development in infinity war, yet they completely ruined his character in end game. Not only did they chuck out modern thanos out of the window and went with a time travel plot, but they also made the past thanos more irrationally more evil and rash, for example he feels no sense of urgency to attack the avengers initially despite the fact that they hold the infinity stones.Fun movie but disappointing",negative
"First things first, I must admit that 3H is very long for the bladder. A good 40-60 minutes aka the build up phase were focused on PTSD from Civil/Infinity War and overcoming it by using Ant Man Quantum Realm as a catalyst to the story. There are some funny moments but it's a safe bet to run into the nearest toilet and not miss much. I think the trailer give it all away. If you were able to somehow skip pr didn't watch the trailer, the effect would be much more enjoyable.Now, the remaining aspects of Endgame were simply Marvelous! The plot might be as simple as stop Thanos from gathering the stones by getting it first, yet the duo Russo Evil geniuses managed to pull down a magnificent script so godly connecting more than a dozen movies to one cohesive story. So many plot twists kept it from being predictacle, it's awesome to delve into relationships that were unthinkable at first glance.You could also felt each cast fighting their hearts out and resolving all these deep emotional encounters.Art and directions were all top notch and oh man the action scenes were so EPIC and massive in scope. It'd be a waste not to watch in the big screen.Also, the pinnacle of this movie lies on Thanos performance. Endgame really show how he could remain calm and collected, his ability as a master strategist, all while possessing unyielding conviction to his ideals not losing to any of the Avengers even on his unavoidable true death. All these qualities make Thanos the best Supervillain in the MCU, period!Overall, YES i would recommend to watch Endgame at least once. I only deduce 1 star because of the 180 minutes mark, and one because maybe it's just me but some action are out of nowhere and felt like trolling.PS also need MOARRR Brie Lawson 😘PPS I left saddened knowing this era is going to end, how some deaths are real and how other upcoming superhero movies needed to up their game to left a lasting impression now that this epic saga was concluded.",positive
This was an EPIC and FUNNY movie! The ending was so cool and emotional.,positive
"Now that it is is gone from theaters, I am finally making a review. It still does contain spoilers though. I love how there was many plots like Thor in 2013 Asgard, Iron Man and Cap America in 1970 New Jersey, and other funny stuff. It was worth watching for hours. As usual in these movies, it ends in an epic battle where everyone fights. Thanos (who died twice) and all his army get snapped in the end. We get some sad scenes, like Iron Man's funeral, but we do get some scenes where everybody is happy. Best movie ever.",positive
"The story was well written, seeded with humorous as well as tearful scenes. It tied together the multiple stories of it's legendary characters with decent closure. Were there plot holes, yes, but this is sci/fi fantasy. am I going to spoil it... no, I encourage you to watch it.
Positive note, no hidden agendas or political propaganda to sour the material regardless of characters portrayed... no animals mistreated in the filming thereof...#hailhydra

I just loved how they executed it so beautifully. I really enjoyed. Marvel studios killed it perfectly and I am hoping to see similar movies in the upcoming period.,positive
I walked into the theater buying snacks for supposed to be the biggest hit of the spring well i must say i did not expect much however what i got was stupendous so so good loads of laughs action and adventure so much fun i do not recoomend taking the youngest of kids and also as this is a long movie if your theater lets you refill your snacks then you should do so,positive
"There's no doubt this was a big budget movie with so much money spent on sfx and acting talent, and what was left over was spent on the story. I'm sorta glad it's over 'cause I don't know if I could take many more fights where the good guys hit the bad guy 100 times until they are almost dead, then the bad guy comes back and hits the good guy 100 times, yadda, yadda, yadda.
The only thing in this movie that wasn't predictable when watching was the explanation of time travel which did not make sense at all and how captain america didn't completely mess up the future with his actions at the end still confuses me.
I had some problems with how at the big battle when spiderman comes through the portal he is slinging webs at something to swing into battle yet there is nothing around him in the sky that he could possibly secure his webs to. I also had an issue with Captain Marvel flying in and singlehandly destroying a spaceship but then when she has the gauntlet suddenly all these female heroes come out of nowhere to protect her. If only they played a beyonce song and had a big girlpower sign in the background so we understood that girls can be heroes #metoo. Scarlet Witch goes from almos destroying Thanos to a sidekick for Captain Marvel in the space of a couple of minutes.
Maybe cut 30 minutes off the movie and it would've been a lot more entertaining. As it stands it's worth watching, just don't try to convince me it's the best movie of all time and worthing of a ten out of ten score. In fact don't even try and convince me it's the best marvel movie in the series.
Come to think of it, with the earth under such a massive threat you'd think they could have called on more then just the Avengers. Where the X-Men and Fantastic Four on holidays?",positive
"For the most part it is a great movie with great action and content, sadly with several key flaws in writing of storyline. Although Hulk has overcome his ""I'm not coming out"" phobia after the trashing from thanos, we never get to see him back in full swing with all of his rage and power - he has been essentially emasculated and is left that way...now becoming a big green nerd . we then progress to the changing of the timeline flawed logic. They are all very quick to theorize you can't change too much in the timeline..no matter how much you are tempted when retrieving the infinity stones to change back history (as well as returning the stones after the correction to timeline)...and we see that both hulk and stark stick to this agreement. But then at the end when Captain America goes back into the past to return the stones to their original owners (with Thor's original hammer) he turns into Donald trump and selfishly and greedily goes back and lives out his life in the past with Peggy Carter, only to return to the present an old used up but apparently happy man (although somewhere in the past he lost thor's original hammer). Hulk, in spite of obviously being in love with Natasha, changes the past and yet still does not bring her back from the dead. And then Stark has his chance to change history and again avoids the temptation of bringing Natasha back to life. Totally out of character to be so selfish and change history for himself. As well if he does choose to change the past for himself why not bring the two dead avengers back to life??? He would be the last avenger to act so selfishly!! Also there is the unanswered issue of the mind stone being returned to the past - assuming the vision is the rightful owner...why isn't he alive then in the present?? Thor's character acting like an imbecile for the entire movie was also disappointing. But the movie did like a whack of action into it. Well worth watching still",positive
"Infinity war was way better, in my opinion. There was a lot of plot holes in the movie to begin with. They had many cringe bathos moments and they crammed in too much emotional elements just to make the movie a n uplifting finale.",positive
"In the movie they say that the time travel will not affect the past?! How is that possible?
Thor even stole the hammer from his past!!!
He left him without a hammer!!!!Hulk basically he didn't have any fight! He did not even got revenge from the last time he fought with thanos.Captain Marvel could just have killed the Thanos without the stones all by herself!",negative

"I don't want to write much in here because you can't really go into the story without spoiling it. All I can say is that it's the pay off the fans wanted.I haven't been as emotional in a cinema for a very long time; I honestly don't know if I have been. This movie is a wild ride of laughs, gasps and tears. The three hour run time feels more like two, which speaks volumes for it.There are a few questionable points that can be nit-picked and require somewhat convenient story points to explain, which originally had me giving this movie a 9. However, upon further thought, the impact this film had on myself and the fans who've waited 11 years and 22 outings for a conclusion, deserves the highest score available. Possibly even purely for the final showdown which as an absolute spectacle.I don't need to tell you to go see this movie, but I'll do it anyway.GO. SEE. THIS. MOVIE.",positive

"I am definitely disappointed after the epic Infinity War movie, perhaps I had my hopes too high, I don't know. However this was a snooze fest! The first 45 mins is all filler and the last 15-20 mins after the big battle was excruciating all fan service and slow paced intending to pull at your emotions but I (and many others) felt nothing. I really felt like this movie never picked up and focused too much on romantic drama that it lost its humorous edge that the last movie had. The laughs in my sold out theater was sparse and underwhelming. It also became predictable with a lot of plot holes. The big death at the end felt forced. There was no reason for it. Overall this movie fell flat, I can't believe there are such high reviews across the board.",positive

We knew going in that there would be some slow spots in the beginning and scenes that would have us grabbing for the tissues just to set us up for all the adrenaline pumping action they could squeeze into 3 hours of film.That said, they should have had some pull to cut down on the half hour of previews before the 3 hour marathon even got underway.But the biggest flaw was not using that post-credits time to give us a quick retrospective of Stan Lee. Just a quick replay of his spots in some of the previous movies and a big THANK YOU STAN would have been sufficient and would have kept a few more people in their seats to watch the credits.",positive
"Just wanted to express my gratitude to Marvel. Thanks for giving us such an amazing 11 years, we are really fortunate to have lived in this era.",positive
"I need to be honest.. I love the Marvel universe, but this isn't the best movie. On its own, I'd never rate it this high, but as a part, or end, of the current universe it is ace.
Mind blown, total overload and yet it manages from big to small, going from all to one hero in a way that works.",positive
An excellent movie in all respects.Some DC fans are on IMDB giving it 1 or 2 stars - they are easy to spot and ignore.,positive
"This lives up to its name, great movie. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat, every part was worth watching.",positive
"I'll try to avoid many in the way of spoilers here. The movie stands well enough on its own two feet. It is a long movie, but about half of it tells its own story in and of itself, picking up where Avengers Infinity War (2018) cliff hanger left off, the other half saluting the franchise in a hat tip that I think is about as fitting a farewell as any you will find in cinema these days. Social engineering agendas aside, I will credit the makers this much: classy!If you have not followed the franchise for any length of time, never mind from the opening Incredible Hulk and Iron Man installments, there are a plethora of hat tips, teasers you might say, to whet your appetite. Even the most recent addition to the MCU, Captain Marvel, had its share of hat tip teasers, including its post-credits scene. Those moments will probably mean more to you, however, if you have followed the franchise.There are a handful of story arcs they could probably develop more, Spider-Man, for instance, perhaps even Capt. Mar-vel. But as franchises go, this was a strong ending to a fairly well stitched together set of interwoven story lines. You will not find any post-credits scenes here. I find it a little bittersweet, but like I said, those hat tips, in-credits acknowledgements, are the post-credits scenes, I think. More salutations for the folks who helped make it such a great franchise.Now if only much of the work generated by the franchise went to U.S. citizenry, but we will not go there for purposes of this review.",positive
"Wow, that was a major anti climax. With a title as 'Endgame' you'd expect it to surpass every story before, not an endless get together, 1 major battle where 1 action here solves it all and then a lengthy farewell. Wished they would have spent more on a good script instead of on 1 big scene full of CGI",positive
Kathllen Kennedy at LF take notes.... this is how you WRAP Out A saga! WOW! WOW! Some parts brought me to sheer tears. The cast was phenomenal on every level and I think every superhero got to have their spotlight.,positive
"Not a superhero movie watcher, watched this because everyone else were talking about it, well when you watch it's it's feels like a really good one with Nice memorable moments, and then after finishing when you think about it, it feels weird the film feels more like a tribute to avengers film than an Avengers film, I'd say Infinity war was better but kids who's love watching superhero films will find it great for sure.",positive
"The movie is average, but severely overhyped. There is nothing special and this really needs to stop being said as Marvel's best movie. Everything that it tried to add in the name of science fiction was extremely confusing and despite trying to make it seem logical, it simply comes off as mumbo-jumbo and in the end you are left confused wondering what just happened. It does not have any substance. Unlike Infinity War, which managed to hold itself together as a film, balancing all aspects such as action, emotion while also keeping the audience engaged and being understandable, Endgame is simply confusing. It is slightly redeemed by the final battle scene, and the visual effects and action is commendable, it does not completely redeem the film and it still remains an average experience.",negative
"Epic !!! What a ride , some really heavy scenes as our heroes battle with their sense of guilt from losing to thanks previously
As they pick themselves back up theirs some great laughs and interactions with older selves once they find a way to manipulate time
The final battle scenes on earth ate truly amazing and and the original Avengers stand their ground and go for to toe against the mighty thanos
Captain Marvel battlefield entrance is spectacular and what a brilliant conclusion as the batan is passed from old to new",positive
"The Best Marvel movie ever seen. Emotional and comedy and Goosebumps scene...
Go watch in theatre",positive
"I need to add on to my review.
I really liked all the girl power in this movie. The team up during the final battle was so epic. I also loved seeing Valkyrie again.
the jokes in this movie, aside from the fat ones, were brilliant. My fave was the ""america's ass"" joke by Tony and Scott.
The moment when all the dusted returned made me cry tears of happiness.
That being said, there was one thing about this movie that I hated. I really did not enjoy how the russos handled Loki. So you wanna keep him dead, fine. But why would you not at least give him one scene with thor? Maybe a vision like odin did or heartfelt talk with past loki like thor and frigga did? Endgame is supposed to bring these characters full circle? Thor got left out of that. Not only did he not even mention his bro but he acted like it didn't affect him unlike frigga's death or the snap victims. Instead we got a past Loki escaping to who knows where and will probably not make up with his bro. Remember Loki promised Thor that the sun will shine again? Well the russos only put that in there to break your heart even more. Unless the sun shines in a future movie, I doubt that we will see it shine on Thor and Loki again. We can always hope.",positive
"Avengers endgame is an epic conclusion of 10 years of hardwork by all the stars, crew membersand every single person who made contribution. The Epic conclusion to 22 movie marvel movies. The Movie has a hell lot of action and Emotions. It made us cry and laugh at the same time. Experience it yourself in your near theatres. This movie is a gem and will be watched for many coming year.",positive
"This film was the climax of the entire infinity saga, and it did not disappoint. One of the best films I have ever seen. And trust I've seen some really good films.",positive
"It's the only superhero movie that I gave a rating of 10/10.
But you can not NOT give a high rating, it's an end of a magnificent saga of great movies and I love it",positive
"That being said .. this movie is okay
decent time traveling storyline ... i give it a 8 because i wasnt really feeling the whole feminist scene in the middle of the battle field 2 out of all those woman can actually make a savage difference the rest are just wak
FAT THOR
Fat thor was awesome and funny .. and i liked him but i kinda wished they would have carried his infinity war character into this movie they made him weak and not as strong,
it would have ben awesome to see THORS depression reveal SO much ANGER towards thanos THAT HE unleashed the full power of the ODIN force , NOW THAT would have ben epikHULK
i love hulk but man they really wrote him out of both movies
it would have ben cool to see HULK finding out about the death of natasha ramonoff and then go into a FIT OF RAGE turning into WORLD BREAKER HULK now that alone i would have givn the movie a 10 ,, he would have destroyed thanosi felt like cap marvel was compeltly useles thruought the whole movie and probably shouldnt have even ben in the movie
and hand down my favorite scene was SCARLETTE WITCH showing thanos whos bossall in alll i give the movie a 8 .. for the final battle scene wich was pretty awesome
-2 cause of the slow pace,
lack of skreen time to baddass characters,
the forced fem fatale scene in the middle of the battle field
other then that its pretty good",positive
"I haven't written a lot of movie reviews but I have penned down my share of restaurant reviews which means I do understand how this paid publicity works and all of that.
And I am starting my review from this statement as I did see some negative reviews here, initially and I was like "" may be all these niners are publicist's reviews""
But then after having watched the movie I would say that may be the reviews which are in tune of less than 6 are from the ""bad publicity"" fraternity. :)
Like good & bad, ying & yang .. when there are paid people to write excellent reviews the vice versa is also true.
For the very first time I felt that the reviews giving them a 3 or a 4 saying ""meh"" are really not the true reflection of Avengers : Endgame.The movie was extremely well made .. the story knitted very well .. a mix of the past and present .. and all of those perfect comic moments as you would expect ..
I enjoyed it from the first scene to the last and everyone present in the theater did too .. when there are laughters and gasps and cheers and sobs and people wanting to stay back after the movie .. in a 3 hour movie .. in America .. it means it is absolutely a beast of a show.
Endgame is a perfect saga .. which will go down as one of the best of the best.",positive
"Barring a few shoddy fillers here and there, Marvel's Infinity War saga has been an otherwise enjoyable experience otherwise. However, Avengers: Endgame fails to live up to the expectations set up by its predecessors. The concept of time travel, while quite alluring is ridiculously tough to get right and the Endgame is brave but poor attempt.The movie is riddled with plot holes and at many places the scenes just feel redundant. You could very well skip a decent part of the movie and trust me, it would hardly make a difference in the end. Major characters like Captain Marvel, Thor and Dr. Strange were underutilized and definitely warranted more screen time.There are a few positives that would still keep you going. The fight scenes are great as usual. Characters like the Iron Man and the Hulk manage to salvage a decent part of the film. The ending is quite predictable so despite the great action scenes, it fails to leave any significant mark.",positive
"I honestly think all these reason make no sense, EVEN within the Avengers world:Captain Marvel can negate the desperation of Stark and Nebula's situation and fly an entire spaceship to earth without any effort.Captain Marvel explains she has to attend to other matters. What is more important than Avengers' mission? She should have been summoned immediately when there was even the slightest opportunity to undo Thanos' snap. Why not give the Avengers a new pager?Thanos is almost immediately destroyed when they find him. A cool battle scene would have gotten the movie off to a better start.5 years later....Ant man is brought back by a rat.Ant man's daughter seems to have aged more than 5 years.Thor is a beer belly de-masculined moron and never gets back in shape. Such a waste. It would be like watching a Rocky movie where Rocky never really fights.Tony Stark can invent a time machine in a few minutes but still does his own dishes. Why not use the 5 year time gap to explain this more logically even within the suspend your believes Avengers world.We now are in an MCU where time travel (without an infinity stone) was invented.Time Travel also means instant space wherever you want to go travel. So many opportunities to get the infinity stones straight from Thanos surely. Why not get them just before he destroyed them instead since they know the date and they know he is alone? Their first mission in the movie was based on going there with the knowledge he still had the working stones AND they had Captain Marvel on their side. Why not try this for real first when time travel is available instead of big problems they will inevitably run into (running into themselves etc)?Weird Time Travel rules to explain why they can't destroy Thanos as a baby but a lot of these rules make no sense considering what happens (old Captain America).Nebula doesn't tell Hawkeye and Black Widow about the soul stone sacrifice.The second soul stone ""sacrifice"" is nowhere near as dramatic as in the first movie. Even the same music is used though.The Hulk/Banner is still useless and never gets his revenge fight with Thanos. What a waste.Time travel is not like Back To The Future at all .... but it is. But Back To The Future 2 handles past events from the previous movie better. It shows the highlights, here we get some background stuff (elevator ride in 2012 etc). There was a better movie I reckon if they had to collect 6 stones from major events from the previous movies and get involved in these more.Thanos is a bumbling idiot who now wants to destroy the entire universe and start again rather than his far more reasoned mission in IW.Thanos doesn't need the stones to be immensely powerful.Captain America brings the infinity stones back (also the soul stone?) with a briefcase.Stark can place all the stones in his nano suit without anything happening to him (compare to Thanos getting each stone). But yet it destroys Stark if he uses all the stones.Gomaro knees Quill in the nuts. So stupid and heartless. Quill - Gamora relationship is erased. It feels like the Data 2 approach in Stark Trek.Gamora is mostly absent from the movie even though she played probably one of the most major parts in IW after Thanos. She's not even at Stark's funeral. No one cares.Captain America can use Mjolnir.Even with both Mjolnir and Stormbreaker Thor is of not much good even though he almost single handedly destroyed Thanos' army with Stormbreaker in IW.Seeing the snapped superheroes come back was cool but was left very late. Also we didn't really see the implications of normal humans coming back.Peter Parker and all his classmates (some unsnapped I assume) still in high school 5 years later.The 5 year time gap would cause so many problems. Where did people snap back? At their homes if they were in a plane? What if their unsnapped loved one was living with someone else by then? I really think the only way to have gone with this movie is if the unsnap happened straight away or the original unsnap was prevented.Younger Nebula can use the time machine to get Thanos and his army into the Future. Why can't older Nebula immediately send them billions years into the past where they would burn up in a young universe.Many individuals without physical power were on the battlefield including Mantis I believe. So weird.With the time infinity stone Dr. Strange surely could reverse Stark's death.",negative
"I'm 24 yrs old, and I've always heard about how people felt when they watched the empire strikes back in theaters for the first time and claimed that it was the moment they kept telling their kids about all those years later.
Well, this movie made me feel that! It left a mark in my memory and my heart and I WILL tell my kids about it should the time ever come. I started watching Marvel movies as a teen and finished them with this movie as an adult. I will still watch whatever they bring next to the table, but Avengers: Endgame has definitely taken the spot as my favorite Superhero movie and one of my all time favorites for the rest of my life.",positive
This movie was a true experience. I enjoyed every single second of it. It was epic.,positive
This has an awesome plot twist. It is action packed and funny.,positive
It's incredible film he have every butterfly thing .I like it,positive
"I think this is a good action superhero movie even it's not as great as Avengers Infinity War. But it still a good continuation from Infinity War and still entertaining, especially for the final fight between the avengers facing Thanos and his army. The final fight was very exciting and made me feel goosebumps every time I watched this movie. Thank you Anthony amd Joe Russo for giving Marvel fans what they deserved🙏",positive
"In this movie we see what amounts to literal years of character and even actor growth. It's truly an incredible feat that we may not see the likes of againI'm a bit of a character growth fan personally. I like seeing how characters change over 5-6 seasons of a show or over 5-6 movies in this case. As an example we have Tony (played by RDJ of course), who at first is the exact kind of uncaring billionaire we love to hate and it's not until he's subjected to his own tech that he learns about accountability and most importantly, how far he's willing to go to correct it. A lot of the problems they faced in the MCU were because of, or about him. I'm his 3 solo movies he creates his adversary, and the same in AOU.Granted though, avengers 1 was more about Loki and Thor than the more human characters. IW was about Thor finding a weapon to fight thanks while everyone else held the fort and in Endgame, Thor really took a backseat while literally everyone else did the heavy lifting, which was kind of refreshing to see as there's only so many times you can watch him single handedly destroy an army, and he's learned his lesson from IW and when fighting Thanos, he's literally ALWAYS going for the head which in the end makes him predictable and beatable (again). But yay character growth(?)As a mid-30s male I'm not ashamed to say this movie ruins me every time I watch it.",positive
The movie had a very good ending scene it was great to see the final battle it totally worth 11 years wait.inspite of a good box-office collection I believe that movies story line was poor it has so many plot holes time travel concept was too much confusing.and one thing I hate most is that. They totally ruined the character of thor and hulk they used them very poorly.i really starting hating the captain Marvel her acting and facial expressions are so dull they made her over powerfull none of Marvel fan will ever agree ghe fact that she is more powerful than thor and hulk and her dialogues was very dull and poor where was she when thanos was. Messing with the world and time travel concept was very illogical not the greatest superhero movie of Marvel I have to say because they destroy the character of thanos totally in the infinity war thanos was a worthy villan man behind a mission and then come the endgame Thanos 😏😏 they could have made a better than this I have to say but as a Marvel fan am not going troll the movie. Because they gave a very good tribute to iron man and cap thank you Marvel for endgame this review is not negative I just write some of the things from the endgame and I wrote it.,positive
"Yes, I know it's been 2 years and that's a long time to be bitter, but I am.This film was amazing it goes everything up that needed to be and gave us the beginning of a new marvel phase. I loved the comedic elements the most it wasn't as serious as Infinity War. My bitterness is though why the needed to kill off Natasha, the character deserved her happy ending and to be a part of the big finish. However Pepper Pots DID NOT. I don't get why she had such a big (ish) part in the story ending.",positive
"Thor is over weight, hits the bottle, plays to many video games, has a jib at some other gamer on the headset, freeloading buddies eat his food, the house stinks and he has a front veranda! and he's Mum tells him to eat his salad! OMGNow as for the rest of the movie, Thanos and he's space cruiser is frightening, that guy is so bad he is as bad a feral cat in a tissue box.I think Captain America is the total good guy and yes he does have a hot ass and so does Peter aka Starlord. Those 2 in Super Gay Hero Movie would be so cool.
I like Dr Stange, he is good guy, Drax, Groot, Mantas, AntMan, War Machine, Falcon are cool, SpiderBoy, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Bucky, The Gatekeeper, Rocket and The Hulk is too,As for Captain Marvel, ... where the hell did that come from and what's worse, it's a 'woman' WTF.The battles are revealing and memorable.The movie does move at a slower pace that former movies.",positive
"The most hyped up soap drama of all time. lots of nothingness and pointless battle
Thanos just sucked in this movie",negative
"Marvel and DC comics have been the heartthrob of teenagers and young @ heart persons since a long time. What makes them special is from visually appealing great picturization to simple fact that these super heroes lives in every young heart. The emotional attachment from Iron man to Hulk to Spiderman to Captain America to Dr Strange needs no explanation.
Infinity War , set new standards regarding super hero movies and every Marvel lover was impatiently waiting for the sequel just like Game of Thrones.
Avengers End Game eventually brings finally everything to its end . Did End Game justified the level of its predecessor Infinity War? The big question was how to get rid of the most powerful villain in history of Hollywood named Thanos. Snap of the finger Game over. Infinity War just put emotions into this epic journey of Marvel super heroes. End Game comes up with logic, theory, science and emotions to make it one of the best classical story ever told just like Lord of the Rings Trilogy.
The screenplay writers must be applauded for making such a fine and satisfying end to such a great movie. The 180 Mins from start to end scene is a perfect visual presentation of a great class. From application of quantum physics to time travel , the movie goer finds everything perfectly placed just like that. From comedy to action to emotions it's a never ending joyride of rollercoaster, which leaves you emotional by telling 'Stark has a heart'.
From the cheering of the watchers in the theatre @ entry of Captain Marvel to great punch lines to Entry of Dr Strange to the last epic battle to the final Snap of the Fingers its once a life time experience. Thanks Marvel for such a brilliant end to Avengers End Game.",positive
I don't have any words for this movie just awesome. I think if this movie was 20 min shorter it would surpass 3 billion mark at the box ofiice and guess what is the only movie that I think deserves that. A perfect ending for a perfect start.,positive
"Now i see all these bad reviews talking about how there wasn't enough action? how it wasn't suitable for kids? or the fact they didn't utilize every single character?Let me just say all this is complete bologna.. this movie from the very beginning tugs on the same heart strings that IW pulled on.
Everyone who complains about how they use time travel in this movie is just an old head thinking that Back to the Future are the only rules of time travel that apply to every movie. Get over your nostalgia.Also any complaints about any of the ""OG"" avengers should be taken very lightly, before you see the movie yourself bc the performances they give you are unmatched from any other superhero movie besides Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool (personal opinion)
And about the all the other characters who were introduced after the first Avengers movie it is because Marvel and the Russo brothers wanted to pay homage to these characters that have been with us for more than 10 years bc THEY DESERVE IT. PHASE 4 will be for all the new characters to have their own saga for THEM and letting the OG's finish this one should be respected bc it is a HUGE risk obviously, and they knew that. But still took it for the fans.....This movie is for the ""sweaties"" as the late and great Jon Schnepp would say. This movie is for everyone who has been on this journey with marvel since Disney/Feige came in and changed the way we will watch superhero movies for forever.I tip my hat to all who had part in creating such an azming film. Thank You Thank you Thank you!!! i can't say it enough!",positive
"No words to explain, but the movie is its own worth. 1000000 stars ✨.",positive
"Watch in Theatres and you'll love it, it's gurantee",positive
Looking forward to whats next! The culmination if all the storylines with a satisfying ending. A+,positive
Unfortunately after all the hype leading up to the movie I was rather disappointed. Infinity War was always going to be tough to top but was disappointed with Endgame as it felt as a walk down memory lane. The fighting scenes were not as good and they seemed rather one sided. Also was not such a fan of how they changed certain main characters appearance - for the worse in my opinion.,positive
It was The best film I wached I like all of marvell comany films but it was diffrent this film exited me and I really like it,positive
"Just ordinary, nothing special from this movie with almost 3 hours duration",positive
"Just a first impression. Minor spoilers only; not going to say who lives and who dies, though I will give a plot point or two away, so don't read on if you haven't seen it yet.I'm a big fan of Marvel's movies, so don't think I am trolling. My honest opinion is that the movie is fun, has a three hour running time that doesn't feel overlong, but doesn't really do anything we haven't seen before, in the way Infinity War did. It lacks something and does a diservice to some of the characters by making them comic buffoons.Time Travel? Really? More End Lame than End Game. At one point some of central characters reel-off time-travel movies, and they don't really come up with any variation on the standard cliches involving such movies. The redo of previous movies is enjoyable but hardly brilliant.Really like Chris Hemsworth as Thor. The writers have turned him into a joke here. Not the actor's fault, he does a fine job, as do all and sundry with what they are given. I didn't buy what they did to Hawkeye at all. The Hulk has done nothing over two huge movies. He was ruined, too. Some of the film is much too broad in its humour.So does this mean the the events of Winter Soldier and Civil War plus all the previous Avengers' movies didn't happen? Trying not to give anything away but parts of this fall into X-Men Days of Future Past territory. Or Deadpool 2. It's confusing and it feels like a rip-off. Cosmic Marvel seems to have taken over everything, and the more grounded movies feel like a thing of the past.I will have to see this again before I give my final opinon. At present I feel a bit disappointed. Much of the movie is fine; the ending is a retcon., like Brand New Day in the comics. And I hate retcons. The central theme just didn't grab me. All in all, Infinity War, Winter Soldier, Iron Man and the original Avengers film were much better for me.",negative
"Masterpiece , if you are fan of superheroes then this saga ends on a big note and this is masterpiece to show-off this saga",positive
"This is as much a review of the reviews as it is to the movie.
First of all, I hate time travel. It can be an easy solution for any conflict but it inherently contradicts any logic created to justify it. Time travel is BS. It can't happen. If you want to follow Einstein or any new age theoretical physicists, it can't happen. The past already happened and there's no changing it.
That being said; Marvel established rules for their narrative. And changed them. Hulk said time travel couldn't change the past. But he was just posing a theory. The Ancient One saod, for some reason, reality relied on the Infinity Stones to remain stable, so Cap put them back. Does that create alternate realities? No Cap has survived 75 years o give his shield to Falcon, changing his own timeline, not creating a new one. So what are the consequences of time travel? Only the future can say.",positive
The film does a great job of connecting to all the Marvel movies from the past. The 3 hr run times seemed to fly past.,positive
"So many bad reviews from people who don't understand anything about good Sci fi movies. Maybe (Dc's justice league) was better hit !? Let's be honest people (I sence a little jealously in the air) cause the reality of things is you will never get the opportunity to be in a movie like (Avengers) or will ever have a superhero movie of your own. So you can say all you want about the movie. (Avengers endgame) was the best Sci fi movie in 2019.
Good follow up storie, good jokes, funny moments and good drama, and good Sci fi action that will make you want to be in the movie yourself. (that scene were Captain Roger's wields the hammer of Thor ) thats a scene to remember, and let's not forget when Tony did his part to save humanity (I was blown away when I saw him wield the infinity stones, the expression on Thanos face is just precious) but it's a pity that we will never see Tony stark as iron man again, and many other characters like (Loki, Captain America, Vision, Black Panther, and many others). If in 20 years from now they make new movies with new actors, they will never be as good as the ones we saw while growing up, they can try but they will never be good enough. And to end my review I say this, End game was and is the best endding possible. And if you haven't watched the 23 movies that changed Marvel's history book then you don't know what you are missing (there are many more to come in the next 2 to 3 years) so I suggest you get started :P :)",positive
"Film is way too overstretched for its own liking and becomes a monotonous affair for most of its part.Story also lacks coherence and the screenplay seems way too predictable.The script is too convenient and at some point becomes hard too digest.Best part of the film remains an adorable hulk,hillarious Thor and an enigma of perfection Captain America.Battle scenes are the USP of the film.
Overall it is a one time watch at best.It would take an Endgame kind of an effort to sit through this movie again.It could have been easily trimmed by almost 30-40 minutes but the compulsion of showing each and every character without weighing their usefulness make this movie a soul missing drag",positive
"I actually saw Avengers: Endgame the first day itself and lost my voice for a week, but I'm reviewing it now because I've seen it today in 3D 4DX, the best version of a 3D movie having talking rats and purple giants. And about the movie, it is 3 hours of satisfying nods and callbacks to our beloved MCU movies, and every second of every MCU movie has built up to this excruciatingly awesome, epic, gargantuan conclusion which is worth every bit of hype. I'm not gonna say anything about the story because, believe me, you don't wanna know it. And Robert Downey Jr. deserves the Oscar for the best actor. The directors and the screenwriters have done a splendid job giving the most satisfying conclusions to Tony Stark's and Steve Rogers' character arcs. Special shoutout to Alan Silvestri for his electrifying and goosebump-inducing music, I almost had a cardiac arrest with his music. This movie is the best of the best movies, the very best. Thank you, Marvel. Thank you, the Russo brothers, Thank you Stan Lee, and Thank you, Robert Downey Jr. for entertaining us for these 11 years. We and the universe will surely miss Tony and Steve. We love you 3,000, Marvel! Thanks!",positive
"Big Marvel fan!! Wanted to get that out of the way before I start!Its just that the way Infinity war was directed and handled overall, Endgame had to up its game and thats where it fell a bit short, I feel. I knew time travel was always in play(so its not even a spoiler); however the direction, screenplay and science of time travel part was weakly handled. I am a huge time travel concept fan(Primer and Time crimes being the best). With the slow pace in the 1st act establishing the foundation for the rest of the movie, I thought they would do justice to the science, implication and the wit of time travel. So I expected a mature take on it. Three things could have been better to complete the time travel ark:-
1. The ripples it created in the alternate timeline were spoken of but not addressed at all when things started to go south in the original timeline.
2. Smart inserts of how original movies had certain scenes which were inexplicible then could have been attributed to this movie's time travel plot. Eg. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the russtle of leaves heard by Hermoine initially was understood when the time travel ark started. Something like that would have made a true Marvel fan giggle with delight. Missed a trick there.
3. Hulk explained that putting the stones back in its place will kill the offshoot timelines - meaning it could possibly invalidate the movie's timeline too!! But that was not addressed; am sure story writers had thought this through, just couldnt translate that in the screenplay.Its best moments can be summarized under 2 points:-
1. Humor (not top grade...nonethess prevalent throughout the movie)
2. NostalgiaBest handled characters in following order:-
1. Iron Man
2. Captain America
3. Thor
4. Hulk
5. Hawkeye andRaw deal for characters which were seemingly important for Phase 4 of MCU
1. Black Widow
2. Thanos
2. Dr. Strange
3. Spiderman
4. Black Panther
5. Vision (no screen time??! Unless you consider Howard Stark's driver Jarvis's voice)Although, I seem to be cynical rather than delighted fan with this review, overall I enjoyed the movie; worth a re-watch to catch the missed 1 one liners :)And if someone at Marvel is looking for Ideas to cash-in on nostalgia, Captain America's final scene can be a movie in itself(and hopefully someone will consider in future)!!!Good Luck Marvel...for Phase 4!...Looking forward to!",positive
Go into this movie with high expectations. The highest you can possibly have. And then watch as it complete blows those expectations out of the water.You will love it x3000!,positive
"If you are a Marvel fanatic,watched all the movies and were actually looking for a culmination,You must have enjoyed it a whole lot. But as a standalone,this movie was not at all worth it. Considering all the hype and marketing,this movie was boring. Way too long and was tedious in the first half. It picked up in the second half but wasn't enough to compensate,It relied way too much on humour and the progression was painfully slow. Me,not being a Marvel fan and after watching just few movies of the series stands disappointed. It was inferior to infinity war for me.
Just my 2 cents",positive
"Gave it an extra star because the ending was a fitting finale. If you haven't seen this at a movie theatre, then just wait for it to come to Netflix or whatever streaming service Disney will release. I was in the theatre for close to 4 hours and it's just not worth it.",negative
"Like many others, I spent 11 years of my life with this universe. I remember the first time I saw Iron Man, right before I started high school. I have loved everything about these movies. Yes, some were rougher than others, but all in all, each film added to the overall Marvel story, and its the first time we got to see a universe built like this. I will forever be thankful for what Marvel has given us in these movies, but I do have some detailed thoughts on the final film, Avengers: Endgame. This will be a decently sized review, so get comfortable.To start, I do want to get out there that this film was pretty great when it comes to a conclusion. I felt emotion time and time again for my favorite characters. I laughed, I got choked up, and I cheered very loudly. The dark tone that it starts with is amazing, and you can feel the deep sadness within some of the living characters so it really adds a great tone to the story. I originally wanted to keep this spoiler free, but to get my point across, larger spoilers will be below. If you havent seen the movie yet, go watch first, then come back and give this a read and Im sure you will agree with me.SPOILERS BELOW:Thor was saved in Ragnarok and Infinity War with his character development. He has lost almost everything. You feel his pain in Inifinity War when he talks to Rocket on their way to Nidavellir to create Stormbreaker. He fails at the end of Infinity War as well when he doesnt go for the head of Thanos, and you can see the feeling of regret right in his face after the snap. They did this beautifully to Thor, to give him some anger and vengence. It might be a darker plot point, but it served him well with everything he had lost alreadyAt the beginning of Endgame, we see the Thor that we knew for quite some time. He's ready to find Thanos and end him once and for all. They find where Thanos is hiding by tracking the use of cosmic energy from the stones. After traveling to Thanos' hideout, Thor ends him once and for all after he realizes that the stones have been destroyed deliberately so that nothing can be undone. Then we get a time jump to 5 years in the future. This is where things get rocky.After the time jump, we see things have changed. Some have decided to move on with the fate Thanos created, and others have barely let go of the memories of the fallen. When Ant Man returns and explains the quantum realm time dilemma, they want to develop time traveling capabilities so they can retrieve the stones from different points in time before Thanos is able to get his hands on them. After Tony rejects helping with this idea because he now has a daughter and a happy marraige with Pepper, they go to San Francisco to meet with Bruce, or should I say Professor Hulk.Before I talk about Thor, Id like to talk about this giant Hulk issue. They ruined Hulk altogether for me. Hulk is now mixed with Bruce's mind and voice because he feels this is the best route to resolve his issue after the gamma radiation poisoning. But hes not the full size of Hulk either. Hes a half man, half Hulk that acts like the weak person Bruce is. With what happens in Inifinty War, why did the Russo brothers decide to go this route with the character? There was so much conflict between Bruce and Hulk, and they decided to just let that go and shift the characters in an entirely different direction. The only real purpose he serves all movie is helping with the science behind time travel once Tony changes his mind to develop the technology. There is also one scene where he uses the stones with Starks's gauntlet because hes the only one who can physically take it, but I mean thats it? Thats all you can give me after years of buiding up love for this character? A giant green, peacful man thats really smart and strong? I was incredibly disappointed by this. It ruined a large aspect of the movie for me. However, that wasnt even the biggest disappointment in this film. Now onto what I started this with.They absolutely ruined Thor as well. After the time jump, Professor Hulk and Rocket go to a Nordic village thats called New Asgard. Whats left of the Asgardians are living here, and surviving peacefully it seems now. We get to first see Valkyrie who tells Hulk and Rocket that Thor wont agree to see them. So at this point, it would be safe to think Thor has gone into a dark place filled with regret and sorrow. What we actually get though is much, much worse. We get a drunk, fat, and comedic Thor. He has lost himself completely and all the character development went out the window. Again, I have no clue as to what the Russo brothers were thinking in doing this. It wasnt funny, it wasnt smart, it wasnt Thor. The rest of the time, Thor just keeps getting sad and emotional and then telling a joke to try and turn the mood around. This is not the Thor everyone loves, and not the Thor I even like one bit. Hes fat, with long dreads, and a beard full of crumbs. I was hoping they would serve Thor and Hulk justice in this movie, but you get absolutely none from them.All in all, this is 100% Captain America's movie. They really should have just titled it Captain America: Endgame. Everything about him in this movie is awesome. Hes a true hero with the best leadership skills and Chris Evans performances as Cap will surely be missed. As for other characters, the development and emotion was great. The two biggest issues were just Hulk and Thor. Everything else worked well.I wish I could write a seperate long ass goodbye letter to Tony Stark, but I dont want to get too carried away, this review is long enough already. All I have to say is thank you to Robert Downey Jr. for pioneering one of the greatest movie universes ever created. Tony Stark will go down as a hero and will be greatly loved and missed. Thank you again to everyone at Marvel who worked hard to give loving fans these 22 movies. You are the real life heros.",positive
"A ten in the book. The previous movie kinda was a bit of downer towards the end because multiple movies were announced a little too early. This movie has many surprises and completed many story lines and also planted the seeds for future story lines/heroes. 3 hours of movie that is paced perfectly is what you will see when you watch this. Putting yourself in the movie mentally is probably the best way to approach this. Imagine the Thanos snap, imagine the Avengers being in shambles, imagine Tony Stark and Steve Rogers approaching you to join them in one last fight. It was an amazing movie, with an unforgettable end.Final thoughts: The next movies has a lot of potential to lay down w.e it wants. We are in it for another 10 years Marvel! Bravo!
Kinda Spoilers but not really:
Thor and Banner get the short end of character development but if you think about it ""That is as human as one can be."" Its natural for them to act and become what they are in this movie.",positive
"I think film is entering a post-cliche phase, where tired tropes are no longer tired, but are now just accepted tools in a storyteller's toolbox. Certainly we don't need to enforce originality on all forms of art. I adore this film. The entire MCU is a breathtaking opera, and this is the ten-year grand finale. You *do* need to see all twenty-one previous films (in chronological order, hopefully, rather than release order) because taken on its own, ""Endgame"" would be a mishmash, with so many of its call-backs missed.I think film is also leaving the era of the auteur, and entering that of the committee. George Lucas may have been the final straw, as when Disney (the originators of the committee method, from what I can tell) picked up the mantle of that particular franchise, their natural choice to revert to committee decisions dovetailed with everyone's need to get franchises out of one person's control. The MCU was planned out ten years in advance, so that almost at once -- and certainly by Ultron -- ""Endgame"" was being envisioned. Seeing how all the disparate threads meet and find either their resolution or their own inspiring arc, that *in itself* is amazing. Knowing that, in the most crucial moment of the film, we get a familiar call-back to a much earlier part of the MCU, elevates the experience from one of possible bewilderment to outright joy. It's no wonder that other directors would defer this type of blockbuster to the Russos. I only wonder how anyone involved in the creative process could have kept these secrets to themselves for ten years. Knowing that this film makes its predecessor seem like a prelude, and all the other significant milestones in the franchise series seem like blips on a radar, it must have been nerve-wracking to know how all of this turns out and still feed us those ""massive"" revelations in the earlier films.When in the right context, a superlative experience. As good a film experience as you will find. Yes, if you don't gel with the film, it could strike you any number of odd ways, but most people are on board with it being a new classic.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is excellent, for a movie that had to be so much The Russo's did a really great job of doing so and giving the main characters the proper send off along with delivering a great end to the MCU's chapter for these beloved heroes. The heart of the movie is Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, their characters in the movie and their conclusion were all perfect. There aren't even words to describe how Spectacular it is, it's not only the best Marvel movie to this day, but quite possibly the best superhero movie ever. This is a movie that gave me everything I wanted and more. It's even worth mentioning how conclusive and satisfying this movie is, in the middle of the humor and exiting action scenes, at its core it's and incredibly touching and emotional story of redemption. It's definitely a movie where so much effort, care, and love was put into, almost as Marvel's love letter to every Marvel fan. I was invested in this movie the second it started. It's a touching, very well written, fun, and extremely well made movie. It's such a wonderful movie that's so well made.",positive
"If you're marvel fan ignore rating and watch this asap
And i love this movie 3000",positive
This movie is my favorite movie ever. You need to see this movie. There was nothing wrong with it.,positive
"I was a little taken aback by this movie. It was not nearly as tightly written as Infinite Wars, it had multiple plot holes, sloppy moments, wooden acting. I don't know how they managed to screw this up, but they kinda did, didn't they? In fact, I'd say this is the worst Avengers movie. However, as entertainment, it kept me interested enough to warrant 7 stars. But overall just a surprisingly disappointing end to an era in the MCU.",positive
Just can't say thank you enough to everyone that had a hand at making these movies come to life. What an absolutely beautiful ending to such an amazing journey.,positive
"Its great, enjoyable, with some of the best moments, but its obvious that Infinity War was the better film. Think Infinity War like Star Wars V, and Endgame sort of like Star Wars VI.Endgame sadly suffers from absolutely lazy writing, from hyping up certain characters only to give them less than 15 mins screen time in this 3 hour film, to misuse of comedic moments because they did not want the film to drag, to plotholes which no sense at all, all the way to featuring few big fight scenes and occurrence of problems driving the plot of the film. However, they did piece a well made movie at the end.This film is certainly the original Avengers' swan song, some characters will not be seen again and to see them one last time here is an emotional experience, and they gave it their best shot in this film. Some characters were treated SO well and its amazing, some were absolute let down and disappointing to the point that Endgame did not need them in this film at all, which is not nice because some of these characters will continue with the new Avengers roaster.Visuals are top, sound effects as well, good humor, plot is okay but can be better, acting 95% of the cast were great, emotional connection is here so you will tear up in a few scenes. Enjoy the movie, all the events from the first film, Iron Man, leads to here with a fitting conclusion. Please note there is nothing during the post credits scene other than sounds of a blacksmith hitting something. Thank you Marvel, thank you original Avengers.",positive
"Infinity war was very good, had solid direction, acting from Brolin, and many genuinely moving moments. There was also plenty of comedy, but also plenty of awesome scenes, mainly involving Thor. There was also lots of great character moments.Endgame ruins everything from Infinity war from the opening bell. It seems they have forgotten how to make movies. The direction and acting is awful, attempting to be serious and have drama, but failing miserably. On almost every technical category I would give this movie a C, direction, acting, editing, score, cinematography, etc.The battle scenes are just so awful, boring, ugly, lacking an weight, or pace, or anything. The only American director I have seen pull off large battles well is Mel Gibson in The Patriot, We Were Soldiers, and Hacksaw Ridge.The central plot of this movie is a huge derivative mess, with the plot to get the infinity stones to bring people back lifted whole cloth from Dragon Ball Z (gather those dragon balls and make a wish), and the time travel... Where to begin.The time travel plot they attempt to be clever by saying time travel doesn't work this way or that, but then go on to make a huge mess of any kind of logic or consistency. They basically just use multiverse theory (ala dragon ball) but then have huge holes throughout. Having seen quite a few excellent takes on time travel, this has to be the most lazy.Speaking of time travel, that whole section of the movie is just a huge waste of time revisiting the events of past movies, which I see what they were attempting, but just because you have lofty reasons in your head for doing something doesn't make it any less of a poor decision. They thought they were being poetic by heavy handily reminding the audience of the past and tying it together, but that is the most brute force way you could possibly tie the past to the future, by having the characters go back there. Was there nostalgia? Was there warm feelings of seeing those things again? honestly not for me. I don't work like that. I just saw the heavy handedness of it, and it turned me off.As far as characters go, no one here was used well, and none of the characters had time to really do anything. I was so impressed by how so many characters were handled so well in Infinity War, but this was the complete opposite. Then characters were outright destroyed, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man, actually I will stop because I realized they actually ruined all that I can think of, except perhaps for Ant-man. Almost no one here was their character, every single one just about was the same, a cynical, cruel, angry, bad person. Just genuinely bad people, virtue less, nothing good. There was no heroism, none of the good qualities that make you like being around people. I didn't want to spend one minute more with these people.So to sum it up, this is a bad movie in execution and fundamental story telling. It also fails me personally because I go to a movie about heroes to see heroes, flawed, but with some shred of goodness that makes me like them. No one in this movie is likeable. Maybe Ant-man comes through unscathed.",negative
"Shocking start and a very shocking ending according to my perspective. What to expect in this movie is lots of emotions, laughs and surprises. It's a movie to remember",positive
Fruitful movie with lots of surprises. I believe i didn't witness a better movie than this.,positive
"I really like every single part of the movie, at any time i was watching the movie i was in shock every second in that movie is to die for, really a masterpiece",positive
"Not a massive marvel nerd but have watched most of them and this is far and away the best of the ensemble movies.After the throw everything at the wall approach of infinity war this was a welcome change of pace , there was masses of fan service, so much in fact I was a little lost in parts as there as some Marvel movies I haven't seen.Thor and Hulk were wasted characters again, but Hawkeye and Black Widow finally got the screen time they deserved, Ant man was worked in well and the pay offs for Stark and Captain America were done really well.There were a couple of scenes that could have been cut and it wouldn't have made a difference to the whole thing but that's being a bit picky.Overall i enjoyed it, not as good as Iron man 1, Cap America 1 or Captain Marvel but got 2 visits to the cinema from me so it was good enough.",positive
It was really amazing! Definitely one of the best marvel movies!! Worth watching!!,positive
This is the wrap up for all the MCU Movies. Epic Ending. Must watch before you die.,positive
"2 things:
1. Can someone tell me what happen to Thor's hammer? Capt. America left with Thor's hammer & returned with his own shield. What the heck did he do with the hammer?
2. Did no one notice Thor's beard. OMG, it changed so much from scene to scene...it's ridiculous. Not only the style but the color! I lost count how many times it changed.",positive

"Well. Went to see it opening night and came out so disappointed. Was reading reviews when going in (without the spoilers) that were so great only to be hugely disappointed!!! No spoilers in this review as none are really necessary. To much time on empty characters (Hawkeye), way to long to bring back the half that are gone so most of the movie was wasted with slow plots that will be destroyed in the end. The captain ending is stupid. How many holes are there now!!! And boring hulk!!!! Why???? Infinity war was on a different level and this just fell off from the beginning. I felt like when I watched the NEW Star Wars movies. Total waste and let down. I think they forgot what got them this far and just caved to making the almighty dollar in the end.",negative
"I went in feeling I was not ready for the ending.
I laughed a lot and cried a couple of times.Some characters story are beginning some are ending.
But For me I feel that they were respectfull to everybody and I can honestly say that I am at peace with this ending. Ill deffo go again this saturday.A well deserved 10 for the end of a decade of filmmaking!!",positive
"IT never fails that the Marvel Comics Movies come to life with something where the good trample on the evil. Something we all need to see these days in a world where there is more doom than bloom in the happiness of life! loved this movie as it keeps the tale of the ultimate prize of winning while sitting with your Judas so to speak. It's so hard not to be sad that they did get rid of one of the ones that I think needed to stay. Even if he did get fat in one of the last ones, but he did come back with a heart for the good. and It really did cost him this time. I recommend seeing this movie because it has the greatest amount of laughter with a wonderful cast and keeps me on the edge of my seat. NO matter if it supposed to be make-believe, but i love al of the thoughts I get from being courageous as I watch this movie overtake the bad thoughts that others bring when they have no imagination to fufil the best they could have in life. if they only believe. But not like what happened to THOR.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is the ultimate showdown to what marvel had built over the past 11(12 at the time of this review) years. The characters that you know and love all facing off against the Mad Titan himself, in a do or die mission. Each character has his or her unique backstory and has different emotions and empowering motives to do justice. It's got a ton of action, but what's amazing is that it's got more character as well. It builds up to the finale, but it's the build up and suspense that leaves us in awe.This movie will make you cheer and make you shed a tear.",positive
"This movie was truly made for the hardcore fans of the MCU, it was filled with action and comedy, it was truly something special. In this new film we get to see these characters that we've known for over 10 years, we get to see it all come to an end.
This is the perfect movie to end THE INFINITY SAGA. I cried a lot, some where tears of joy, and others where tears of sorrow. But all together this movie was spectacularly amazing.
Definitely one of my favourite movies of all time.",positive

"It was a great movie. The action,comedy,acting was amazing.Hats off to the direction,the story. The actor done a really amazing job.Full of fun. So amazing .",positive
"It's a great movie, Amazing Direction.But they shouldn't have done this with Thor & Hulk!
I think it was more of only Captain America and Iron Man thing. I know it was their last movie and they deserve a farewell but there should be a balance, its an Avenger movie afterall and not another Civil War!The action sequence suddenly became everything about Women Empowerment out of nowhere, just because Captain Marvel had the gaunlet.And for god sake hammer is a Thor thing! Lets just settle with that? First Vision and now Captain America, everyones worthy but you mess with the Thor, make him a couch potato the entire movie.
Thor of the present can kill Thanos of the present twice. But he can't harm Thanos of the past at all? Great!The humour was better than ever but the action sequence wasn't as well as the Infinity War.",positive
I watched avengers endgame last night and it was amazing. Don't wait for the post credit scenes there is none.,positive

I went to see this with high hopes but wasnt sure however i went to see this and boy was i impressed the action was full and exciting and even the humor was funny i do suggest if your theater lets you get extra snacks as the movie is long in lenth so so good though also keep it away from small kids the violence is too extreme for their little minds,positive

"The avengers has become a phenomenon that cannot be ignored in contemporary pop culture. Before its release, ""Avengers: Endgame"" showed us its box office influence.

"Thanos' personality change seems to confuse most people, but I found it quite understandable. His whole life had been in pursuit of a certain goal, and then he saw it all undone.By the way, I saw this one review saying that time travel was unrealistic, apparently you haven't been paying attention to the ludicrous power sources, actual magic and reality warping gauntlet that's at the center of all of this. With that said, Hulk's explanation of how theirs works is bogus.",positive
Not enough Action to justify the final battle.. Really... being the End of an Era... lifetime movie... come on.. Infinity war has an 9 pointer from me but this endgame... I don't know... just a bit disappointing in the action department. No Thrill at all. I guess a few folks are right... Fan service Movie...,positive

"Just saw the film. Beautiful. Funny. Sad. Awesome. My friend and I can gladly say this film summates the vigorous journey that we have all been on since the first Iron man in 2008. The Russo's have wonderfully done it again, with this film out-shining many of their previous films, and many of the other marvel films. This film has the ability to manage a complicated storyline having eleven years and twenty-two films lying on its shoulders, and yet still is able to incorporates stunning visuals, brilliant acting, great dialogue, beautiful cinematography, score, and more. The film is hands-down, the best film marvel has created. It beautifully captures the true heart, love, and pain that these films have always produced for the fans. It is amazing. I myself, will be remembering this one for years.Enjoy it, you earned it. The long await has finally come.P.S. I feel like this film is honestly Oscar worthy. Robert Downey Jr's performance is amazing, where he beautifully captures this extensive journey of material in film, which all started with him. His time and effort, which has created this cultural phenomenon deserves praise. Also, the Russo brothers. These comedically genius brothers have positively made their mark in cinema, through this film. If they do not receive a nomination for either best director, or the film isn't nominated for best picture, I don't know what the academy is doing. I know they don't normally go for comic book movies, but this, this is something different.Have fun people.",positive
"Without throwing any spoiler I would say that it was obvious that it won't be a happy ending movie but the expectation that we had for this movie was sky high. Whatever you're expecting, you would find much more in the film. Truly epic & and the nearly perfect ending to a long journey but it does not mean we wont see anymore Avengers Movie in future. It not a conclusion for the entire Marvel series but it defiantly concluded some of our favourite heroes journeys. Go and experience this masterpiece you won't regret it.",positive
"What an incredible motion picture. The cast were truly fantastic, but Renner completely stole the show.Amongst other fantastic performances from the likes of Downey Jr, Paltrow, Hemsworth, Johnasson and Holland, Renner's portrayal of Hawkeye stood out.A character who is criminally under-appreciated in the MCU has a good amount of air time in this 3 hour block buster and deservedly so - Renner, while unlikely to receive any award nods, undoubtedly should.",positive

But Sherlock Holmes 3 is on floor.",positive
"This movie made me cry three times. I laughed. I almost fell out of my seat(no joke). The way this movie was written, was absolutely ridiculous! There is no extra scene, but there is a very important detail, at the end. And it is a great ending to the almost end of phase. This movie is worth the wait at lines, the crowded theaters and the three hour wait. Must-See movie!!",positive
"Where to begin.
Endgame needed to do A LOT in terms of ""landing"" characters, and drawing conclusions. After all, this movie is leaving you with impressions that for many of the characters, will be the final one (I'm not calling out deaths here, simply that we don't at this point know if Marvel will make more movies including a lot of the characters here). The stakes have perhaps never been higher for any movie ever made. Do they succeed? Oh yes. Yes they do.One of the reasons, I believe, is because the actual plot of the movie is genuinly plain and simple: Can we reverse what Thanos did, and also kill him?
While this is by no means an easy task, the simplicity of it allows for the movie to work towards a finale with a 2 hour build-up, that largely centers around quick, well thought out and highly rewarding ""dives"" into our beloved heroes and their own personal stories, while they try to ""solve the problem"". And this was a REALLY smart strategic move from the writers/directors, I think. This type of character-first type of approach, makes it easy to bring in a lot of references, which to anyone who's even just seen half of all previous Marvel movies, should result in a permanent mini-grin from beginning to end in fan-service galore. No matter who your favorite hero is, chanced are you'll be very pleased.In all fairness, the movie is a bit slow in the beginning. At least I can imagine it is for those that don't appreciate all the references as much as I do. But man does it pick up. I don't know who you are or what you have seen before from Marvel, but as said, the plot and the ""mission"" is simple enough - and the real actual endgame of Endgame will not disappoint you in terms of action, humor, or heartcrunching twists and turns. I laughed, and I cried, all while at the edge of my seat.I'd say there's no question about whether you should watch it or not. If only to witness a movie never before created, that wraps up 21 others - go watch it. But besides just telling you this, I do want my review to be ""helpful"" (even though people will anways click those buttons below based on whether they ""agree"".) But in order to try and be helpful: If you have seen all or most of the movies leading up this and wonder if you should rewatch something before watching Endgame, then I suggest Spiderman Homecoming and Guardians. Maybe even Guardians 2. I won't say they are in any way important to understand any major plot points, but there are references and relationships from these movies that might give Engame a stronger emotional grip on you if you have them fresh in memory. With THAT said, you'll get tidsbits from possibly every single movie from the Infinity saga, so nothing will be wrong in term of warm-up-movies. Those are just my personal recommendations :)Have fun!",positive
"Storyline is okay but not good as part 1.It is little bit confusing on some places like go back in past and how they know where to get the stones. In first half, I am literally waiting for thrill. First part of film is very talkative n i think unwanted scenes. All characters looks alive but x factor is invisible.Caption Marvel role is short but sweet. Hulk factor is not there. Actually Marvel fail to give waitage to all the characters as in earlier series of avengers.Bright sight of the movie are comedy scenes, action scenes, plotting, visual effects and sound effects.It's not like money I spent is wastage but as per expectations it not fulfill the legacy.First time I am writing the review but It all true for my perspective.",positive
"My first review, as this movie totally deserves it.I think Infinity war and Edgame are both amazing movies. Nowadays is hard to make a movie and satisfy everyone, as people have extremely high expectations and we are being so spoilt. Some people saying that Infinity War was better, but cmoon.. its so hard to make something even better than Infinity War. But i think MCU did an amazing job with Endgame.",positive
I realize that I'm getting old. I almost fell asleep watching this movie. Kids will definitely like it. A lot of actions that make no sense. Iron Man\Tony Stark is one of the overestimated character.,positive
"I watched the franchise only to know some important twists in plot and to brag with people who are interested in this stuff. However, I missed some parts(because I am not a fan of Marvel).But... I didn't understand the whole movie... who were the characters who returned to life? what relations did they have to main characters? there are still many questions and it was not so exciting.so, I didn't enjoy the movie, sorry, Marvel fans.",negative

"Endgame is mind blowing it exceeded my wildest expectations. Yesterday I watched it in Centaurus on smaller screen with low sound quality still enjoyed a lot. It is impossible to digest this movie first time there is so much going on, Trust me no one is prepared for this 3 hours thrill ride.
Anyways today i watched it again in Arena bigger screen better quality and sound and I enjoyed every second of it. Could've been 20 minutes shorter though but still no complaintsSigh... this is indeed end of an era.",positive
"As a die hard fan who has watched all the MCU movies on hall from Thor dark world to Endgame it was a really wonderful experience to witness the 2nd last chapter of phase 3 and the infinity saga I loved endgame from the moment the movie started and till the post credits scene
There were many moments where Endgame made you cried made you feel to scratch your head and made you feel just keep hooting for your heroes but like every movie as a die hard fan I watched it almost 8 times on hall and 3 more times on pc and I can say that there were many flaws in the movie and there were many scenes which could have been better so much for eg (the captain America fight) they could have brought another reference of comics to this movie of old thanos meeting the future one but nothing is ever perfect but I can say this was close to perfect
And of endgame ever comes to hall again for some days I'll watch it and so will any marvel fan
Goodbye the original avengers you will be forever alive in my heart
I love you 3000",positive
"This movie was priceless. Even though most of the movie was them time traveling, but the final fight scene where all the vanished return is worth waiting for the movie to end so you can use the restroom.",positive
"This is a masterpiece. Don't listen to the bad reviews they have no idea what they are talking about. This is great at showing character development, especially with Tony Stark. Probably the best movie I have ever seen.",positive
"As the continuation of the ""Avangers: Infinity War"" movie, this film was successful to make the audience feel very curious about the end of the story. This film tests whether you are really Marvelous or not. When you watch this film, you will feel every second of this film is a pity to miss. Three hours duration of this film feels nothing for me, even I wish it could be a little longer.A continuous story from previous films makes this film very interesting to watch and also difficult to predict the end of this film. Anyone who might miss the previous Marvel films related to this film might not understand the parts related to this ""Avengers: Endgame"" film. I think the camera and sound effects is perfect. Each of actor and artist successfully plays the hero character entrusted to them very well.A good teamwork is very highlighted in this film. This film teaches that the optimism in achieving a goal, even though it must pass a big challenge. When I watch this film, I feel touched by the struggle and the sacrifice made by the team. Every scene from this film has its own meaning, even It's not hesitate to shed tears for some sad scenes. I want to watch this movie again and again because i just want to say that this is one of the best Marvel films. If possible, I want to give 11/10 rate for this amazing film.",positive
"This may perhaps be the most underrated film of all time. It was quite good, not great but still this movie got nowhere near the love and attention it deserves. It got nowhere close to the amount of money it deserved, so sadly I don't see a sequel coming our way any time soon. I guarantee this film will be more popular in 5-10 years. Ignore the mindless hater drones who attack this movie. Also to the mindless haters who continually dislike my reviews please stop now. Overall 7 out of 10 I liked it.",positive
"The Thanos we see in the beginning of the movie, the new-age super villain who thinks he is in the right, unlike the classic ""just evil without a purpose"" trope, gets replaced with a younger Thanos at the end, who is ruthless, arrogant and overconfident.That's good though! It doesn't destroy or deconstruct Thanos as a character. The character development of the original Thanos feeds right into the whole reversal of his development.The young Thanos was showing psychopathic tendencies, since he hadn't yet faced his own personal ultimate sacrifice. He had not yet fought to obtain the infinity stones. He never had the character development the old Thanos experienced. Never had to push Gamora to get the soul stone. It just landed on his lap.Having not faced such burdens, and poisoned by the illusion of ""assured victory"", he acted just as his character at that stage would have.Same with Nebula; none of the events had happened that would change her forever. Not having been exposed to the true love Gamora offered her, she never went over the tipping point; not even after seeing the future Nebula.""What did it cost? Everything"" is the punchline of Infinity War.Not for the young Thanos. Not for the young Nebula. None of the essential scars on their souls that would tip them to wherever existed when they traveled through the time portal.Also, Ironman, the true godfather of the MCU, got the sendoff that he deserved. It was a good decision to give the final snap to Ironman.And the Captain America send-off was so sweet, it was the perfect scene to end it all. A dance in peace with the one you love.Amazingly well done movie, with some small plot holes and minor disapointments here and there.",positive
"Initially I was pretty impressed by this movie. Great effects, time travel aspect of it seemed interesting, the deaths of many important characters was a nice touch. So I went to see it again, and boy, is it painful when you look at it with a bit of critical eye :PFirst of all, the pacing is all over the place. First part (let's call it 'grief chapter') is just... boring. Then we get the 'mumbo jumbo time travel chapter' when they figure out the way of building time machine to go back in time (it's the part when at first I was like 'suspend your belief and enjoy the ride', but you just can't ignore glaring holes in not only plot, but also logic on a most basic level). Then we have an epic battle with some cool moments (Cap+Mjolnir) and then back to boring grief again.Thanos feels like completely dfferent being. He's way stronger and less interesting. Time travel stuff was a mess, not only because of the paradoxes it presented but also on a most basic causality level. Hawkeye got way too much screentime. Weird Hulk felt like a cop out, Thor was turned into a joke. Captain Marvel was not present throuought the movie, she appeared for couple of minutes, kicking absolute crap of everybody.All in all, this movie is just a nice fan service. People wanted to see Cap happy, there you go. The person who started it all - Iron Man, also ended it with the bang, splendid. Asgardians of the Galaxy? Yay. You can't deny though that taking all of the other things into consideration (plotholes, time travel issues, continuity problems, pretty uneven ensemble of heores), we got a movie that's just messy.",positive
"If you kept away from spoilers and you purchased your ticketto go see the long waited Endgame...well, you will might end up after 3 hours of watching it, just like me, dissapointed. I know I was! What a mess !
Of course it is intended to patch screenplay holes up, or cut ties with actors that are no longer part of the franchise... But , I mean, come on!
Some of the make-up effects are just terrible, and yeah it is a very important Avenger with a very disturbing beard and wig to begin with!
Plot, caracter developement, lines, ughh...my expectations dissapeared, you know, snap of fingers!
3 stars given for the few laughs here and there , my favorite characters and 1 epic battle !",negative
Funny. Lovely. Action. Epic and at the same time full of meaning. Everything is going perfect,positive

"Seeing a movie like this was an awesome experience. Avengers: Endgame, had all, comic moments, dramatic moments, painful moments, battle, personification of love for humanity, heroism and finally JUSTICE and happy ending. This film was the end of a glorious era in world cinematography.",positive
"As, we all know that this is the 22nd installment to MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) which they started in 2008 with a bang from ""IRON MAN"". So, it would not be exaggeration if way it is another diamond in MCU's kitty.Lot of people still getting difficulties to watch ""Avengers Endgame"" in cinemas as all the shows are full for this weekend. This is showing how the people are waiting for this globally to be released.I would not share story or plot in this review, however would like to share how the ""Avengers Endgame"" starts. It starts as, all the remaining super heroes (who got spared from the Thanos snap in Infinity war) trying to find the Thanos. So, that they can get back all infinity stones and reverse back what has happened.
Finally, with the help of ""Captain Marvel"" they got the location of Thanos. A very quick and small fight scene has shown, and Thanos got killed. Ha Ha Ha that's not the complete plot of the movie. (You got to watch the movie on screen to know the full story - sorry).Now, the ""Avengers Endgame"" started, how they assemble the remaining team, what they do next, is Thanos really got killed etc.I also wanted to complement the screen time of a lot of our characters, the Russo Brothers did this so perfectly and i believe that they should oversee a lot more of the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.There are few surprise entries of superheroes which will amaze you.There will be some moments where you will be like freezing and trembling too. So, thank you and once again for the epic word, ""Whatever it takes"". Glory to the Avengers and may it be the one and only that nobody can break its record.",positive
"This movie was great. It was full of tragic moments, plot twists, new concepts and more. The ending was great, and I walked out of the movie theater greatly satisfied. It wrapped up the MCU in a great way, and will make all future films more memorable.It was just great!!!",positive
"He movie was OK. Nothing spectacular. They need to find the infinity stones again for some reason. Then they go back in time to find them. Hulk snaps then Iron Man snaps and dies and, Hulk doesn't?They have war again? Why I don't know maybe for the stones? I don't know. Infinity was better way better. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.",positive
Amazing movie overall the plot was fabulous and the end was very emotional the movie is dedicated towards a simple value that is unity and working together it's amazing that how every hero comes together and works together to save the universe overall amazing movie I'm giving10. The action is amazing the vfx are amazing the directory is awesome and the height of characters and the traits is amazing every character has his own stories and that stories are meant to be shared with the public because there so inspiring highly recommend you to watch this movie this is an amazing film and hats off to Marvel for creating such a must piece.,positive
"The directors made thanos in Infinity war a necessary evil.
I always knew they are never going to top it.But they didn't even come close to respecting the ultimate character they build.They disrespected Thanos.He may be bad,but he has a rootable gole.""ONE MAN'S TERROIST IS OTHERS SAVIOUR""",positive
They wanted to make a film and tell a story with CGI. They failed. Why are actors giving their faces for this? Its the only human thing left in it. Everything else is just CGI. Tells me nothing.,negative
"Avengers Endgame is an SUPER AWESOME movie .
It actually made me cry and I'm a crying person.",positive
"I've never come out of a film not being able to process what I've just witnessed! This is a masterpiece 10 years in the making! Every aspect of this film is perfect, Marvel and Russo brothers have topped everything that has been done in the past! Avengers: Endgame has scaled heights that I didn't even know were possible!A 10 out of 10 doesn't do it justice!!",positive
Great movie. Great ending. Great actors. Miss Iron Man💔 the most,positive
"Avengers: Endgame, ends a saga that has been created since Iron Man released in 2008, the film starts as it should start in a breathtaking scene. Throughout the film we show how the world was after the snap of thanos, or what the universe of marvel calls: the blip, in the first act of the film focuses more on the avengers trying to reverse the snap of thanos and also has some very epic scenes and many references in the second act of the film, finally the war which we have waited for 11 years and 22 films. The final scenes are simply one of the best scenes in the history of cinema. Anyway, Avengers: Endgame is the biggest event in the history of cinema, the best superhero film in history and deserves the box office that it won, what I think is bad that Avengers was despised in the awards, but for Marvel it doesn't matter, for me Avengers: Endgams is a film made as a declaration of love to fans and an end of a cycle and one started a new.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is my favorite MCU movie and my all time favorite as well. I loved the message that the movie gave: That everyone deserves a second chance and that every Journey reaches the end of the road sooner or later. I also loved every single thing that I saw in it. From Tony's Daughter to his Sacrifice. Iron Man may not be everyone's favorite but he gave his life to save the lives of Trillions. And when it comes to Thanos, he is by far, the best Villain in the MCU, since his quotes are so true, but trying to save Population the way he did, no matter how right he sounded wasn't the appropriate way to achieve it, even if it was the only way to do it. If you watch this movie and Avengers: Infinity War before Endgame and you pay attention to Thanos' Interesting Quotes, you'll see that (theoretically) he wasn't wrong about his actions.",positive
"So emotional especially if you've been invested in the series. Cried countless times, a masterpiece if you're a long time fan",positive
"As a longtime fan of the MCU and even more so the comics, I felt kind of empty inside after watching this movie. There were a lot of changes from the comics that I can get behind, but more that I can't.First thing I can't understand is how they didn't implement Adam Warlock into the story; even though they teased him in a end credit several movies ago.Second thing I don't understand is why they need captain Marvel to stick out so much as the strongest hero, even though she doesn't hold a candle to lets say Thor in power levels that you can find in comics or wikis. I get that Hollywood want to look progressive and cool with centering more on badass female characters. The scene in Avengers infinity war were Scarlet witch gets assistance from two women was cool, but now there's a scene were like 20 women assemble during this huge last arc fight and I just think they're forcing it to hard.Third thing are the millions of small plot holes I found in the movie, which I'm not gonna go over, because my review would be ""infinity characters"".The visuals of the movie were great. The one thing I did find a bit off putting were the Hulks facial features. Otherwise didn't notice anything.
9/10 VISUALS.The acting was great for the most part. RDJ and Benedict Cumberbatch among others never dissapoint. Some actors are not of the same caliber but overall very good acting.
8/10 ACTING.The thing that bugged me if you read the beginning of my review and have made it this far was the writing of the plot. Not considering the plot holes or the comicbook backstory screw ups, time travel is so lazy. A rat stepped on a control panel to save the galaxy basically. There were some funny/good stuff in the story aswell, but the good just cancelled out the bad for me.
5/10 STORY/PLOT.So my final Score is approximatly 7,3/10 (22/30) aestheticly pleasing, with good acting and ok story.My friend who isn't a big comic fan used my rating system and got 7,7/10 (or 23/30) so appears to be slightly more enjoyable if you aren't a huge fan.My rating system is as follows...
1/10 appaling
2/10 horrible
3/10 very bad
4/10 bad
5/10 ok
6/10 fine
7/10 Good
8/10 very Good
9/10 great
10/10 masterpiece
(Always rate story/plot, acting/voice acting and visuals/animation seperatly and do the math)",positive
"Takes me back to the 70s and the big movies back then...Jaws, Star Wars, Close Encounters. The experience I had with this movie is exactly like I had with those. But the best way I can sum up this movie is with one word. UNFORGETTABLE!!! If you are a huge MCU fan you will love, be happy, and proud of this movie. It delivers in spades what you hoped and wished for.",positive
"Well... enjoyed the final hour of the movie more then the rest of it. Iron man dying sad yes, captain America deciding to stay in the past was probably an ending that was needed for him! There were plenty of plot holes... I mean just out of the blue iron man figures out time travel... ok that was too easy! At least make it a little more challenging! Leave that aside there was also how thanos all of a sudden doesn't need the stones to defeat the avengers... yeah should have made that a thing the first time he appears but oh well... just a money grab. Didn't need to be 3 hours maybe 2 and halfish hours. Either was enjoyable but too long and dragged out story. I do however see how it got to 2 billion though. Loyal fans!",positive
"The half part is boring, and its not really fun to see so many super hero, not a really good inspiring story or no story at all. Glad it finally ends.",negative
"This is my favorite movie of all time. I it love, i watched it 3 times in the cinema. Best movie ever.",positive
"This movie wrapped years of marvel movies I have seen and it was epic, people are saying it was slow it was boring, I don't think they understand how the movie was the story had emotion with that emotion you lived the last ever marvel avengers movie.This movie is just amazing it has thrown everything in the mix and I would say if you have not seen this movie your are missing out.",positive
"This movie was actually a 11/10, but I have to make it balanced.",positive
"Avoiding to see any theories is very hard these days, so almost every possible scenario was in my head when i was watching this but still how they will pull this off i am glad i didn't know. I was a bit disappointed only on the fact that they way of ""fixing"" things was something ""easy"" to think but i am happy because it was Hard to actually do it! I almost cried 2 times in the middle, and of course the end.... i cried like a baby 2-3 long times....movie was short for me... felt like 1.5hours. not 3.Without talking any spoilers they did an amazing job on ""visiting"" the previous movies, and there was no stupid humor but there was some coll scenes where the directors was like ""hey funs id you had this theory or question , here is why it didn't work or here is now and how it should work"" and i was glad about this. HISHE will have a hard time to joke about this one now, must most important the Honest Trailer will also have little plot halls to explore.They did good job with Captain Marvel and how they used her when it was important, and i just didn't like the 1 obviously feminist scene that was there because of the ""trending"" of our times ...i will re-watch it 2-3 times waiting to see it in 2D and enjoy it, and then download the brluerays. As about the end credits scenes......well...just LISTEN!",positive
"Started dark but really brought the story together, worth the wait but now we feel empty that the series is over!",positive
"I liked the movie because I took it as a greatest hits version of the entire franchise. Many people are disappointed, but are too critical with petty things.I liked the fact that almost all the characters were included and we got the chance to see scenes from past movies. A great farewell to characters that leave the universe. They left honorably and gives you a great sense of nostalgia knowing that they will never show up in future movies of the MCU.Plot holes... Well, yeah. What movie that includes time travel is free of plot holes? Just take it as the it is and go with it. Its a good way to enjoy a movie that has time travel. Otherwise its gonna be very bad experience.I liked infinity wars better because it brought a more original feel to it, as Endgame uses a lot of previously done material. Infinity wars has a very unexpected ending, hard to predict. In Endgame everyone already knows the outcome, the good guys win.All in all, i felt the movie was amazing, the special effects were incredible and i can't wait to see what the MCU has in store for the next movies!",positive
"Infinity war had set up huge expectation from the Endgame. I was looking forward to the movie but I was mighty disappointed. The first couple of hours of the movie are really slow and dragging. The fight scenes are OK but seems hurried up. The story line is emotional but that is not the weak point for the movie. Some how it felt disjointed and underwhelming. I wish it was as beautifully crafted as the Infinity War. Not sure if we will get any more of Avengers in future , but hey part of the Journey is the end!. Thanks Marvel for years of entertainment :).",positive
"Watched the movie with lots of expectations and it didn't disappoint the world. Beautifully done with great of everything. The greatest, mind blowing and mind storming. The perfect combination of joy, entertainment and feelings.",positive
"I like the movie, but I can't say that it's outstanding. For most fans, it should satisfy. I like the Marvel movies. None of them are perfect, which includes this one. I believe it's worth seeing if you are fan of the previous Marvel films.",positive
"When half of the universe has been wiped out, when your dear ones passed away and when all hopes have been faded, don't worry, just ask a big green guy to help you travelling the time and all your problems will be solved. That basically sums up the film. All's well that ends well except for a philanthropic billionaire in a metallic suit who gives his life to save the universe...how original!
All the fake emotions and childish humors from the post 2000's superhero movies are masterfully treasured here as well for the delight of the simple minded. Adding all the enjoyable special effects and the diversity of the superheroes eclipsing the incoherent simplistic plot, and that gives you the most profitable movie of all time. Better on the form nothing on the substance if you ask me. But well, to each his own!",negative
"Avengers Endgame really was a movie filled with action, emotions, dept in story and characters and i can't wait to see it again. I won't spoil anything considering Dr. Strange managed to watch endgame 14 million times without spoiling it, but i will say this, you need to watch Infinity war first (if anyone hasn't seen that awesome movie yet, go see it), you need that to understand the backstory. Preferably ALL marvel movies so you get a grasp of each character that might appear.But the movie itself doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like 1,5 hour, and thats because its stuff happening all the time, and it makes turns you wouldn't see coming, which only makes it better.It's an emotional ride just as well as it's a tribute to Stan Lee and all marvel characters. I watched it the 24 of april, but i could easily watch it again tonight.On my 'awesomeness' scale this get a solid 10 out of 10.",positive
"I'm just a huge fan of MCU and I've watched every marvel movies ever since Ironman till now. About Endgame, I'm so speechless and to be honest no movie can and will not compare Avengers Endgame film. Thank You #stanLee",positive
My 1st ever review. 9 is an absolute disrespect to a masterpiece. Yes. It's that great.,positive
"Simply the greatest happening in the world of cinema / geek / nerd.A work derived from a long planning, a great study and great production, gathering all these actors, tying a giant script and closing with giant surprises and golden key, is for few!Thank you MARVEL for inviting me to become a film industry professional, thanks to this infinity saga I chose my profession, and my reference is you, thank you!",positive
Its best movie I have ever watched that's all I have to say #Endgame,positive
From Iron Man to Endgame I've seen them all and for me this was the best one because it completed everything. I loved every minute of it and I'm gonna miss seeing all those guys together. The movie was amazing There were sad parts and funny parts and I enjoyed them all.,positive
"We have seen it far too many times now.. 90% greenscreen fighting against bad guys and the good guys end up winning. Just More of the same old recipe, other than that it was executed as good as all of the other superheromovies. For me, im done.. Its Just the same, if you like it to be the same then its probably 8/10 for you",positive
"An amazing movie, emotional, funny and with so much action! One of my favourite movies! It is worth watching! You will see the best actors of Marvel and the best of the best is Robert Downey Jr. in all the parts of avengers series . It's priceless !!!",positive
The movie ends after the first 15 minutes... Very disappointed,positive
I don't want to say anything the movie is yuck. i didn't like the story u think the story is lame and nonsense and stupid,negative
"I dont know how to say butThe movie just perfect, from the story,visual,acting,and the battle are just perfect, this is movie in generation, must watch quckly.",positive
"We've gotten to know and love these characters through over 20 films over ten years, a fitting ending to the Infinity Saga was of course an extremely difficult task. But the Russo brothers (Joe & Anthony) deliver, once again, a glorious Marvel movie.After Infinity War, which at the time was the biggest cross-over event in film history, Marvel was on top of everything from the box office to the standards of Comic films. Marvel has excelled at every turn this past decade, Endgame HAD to do and be a lot of things. It had to break all the records Infinity War just broke, and please fans just as thoroughly.Not only does Endgame feel unique from all that's come before it, it also hones in on what made Marvel great to begin with: it's characters. Endgame's pivotal move was to make this movie extremely Narrative AND Character driven. It didn't bank too hard on its action set pieces or its witty comedy, but they did those exceedingly well too. Endgame had a heart.We took a stroll down memory lane, it feels like, through some of the best moments through MCU history. Time travel was bound to be a big part at some point in this universe. Marvel (and comic books in general) is no stranger to time travel, parallel dimensions, and alternate timelines; Endgame's excellent use of this narrative shows that Marvel isn't afraid to make bold choices.Endgame is a PERFECT follow up to the jaw-dropping Infinity War. They take all of our characters, especially our original set of Avengers, and bring them to some very interesting places, literally and figuratively.I cheered with joy, I bit my lip in anticipation, I sighed, I laughed, I cried; I love this whole saga with my whole heart. Endgame matches the expectations and surpasses them.It's easily a 10/10",positive
"I'm just arriving from the cinema... the movie is absolutely awesome. The plot is very well written, the action is well constructed, the acting is top notch... everything was awesome. The only thing I would add would just take a couple of minutes, it could be even as a mid credit scene, I would've liked to see just a scene of Old Cap going to see Natacha just before the go back in time and tell here that they win in the end, that way we would know for sure she would know they won.",positive
"You won't need a bachelor's degree in Marvel to see this movie, but some background information will definitely help, as the character gallery is gigantic. Arguably Black Panther, Thor, Doctor Strange and Infinity War are the most important to see.Props for good acting, cool effects, and great pacing. The 3 hours of the movie went surprisingly fast.As always the characters are invincible and can seemingly survive anything. That holds for those without superpowers as well. And, as you know they all have somewhat cringey humour, thus my deduction of two stars. Plot holes are also apparent. Though, I'll give the creators huge props for actually managing to stitch together a movie of these proportions in a somewhat coherent manner. The ending battle is also nothing short of epic.",positive
This movie was just perfect. Never been so engaged in any franchise like Marvels. Masterpiece in any superhero franchise !!!,positive
This is the best movie. wathced it so many times and still watching.,positive
"It was the perfect ending a great made movie but captain marvel ruined the movie.
Reason I gave this 8 was because it wasnt that entertaining which I thought it would be. Im also not the biggest marvel fan so dont @ .",positive
"Honestly, this has to be one of the best marvel movies I've ever seen, but although I feel like the plot could've done better and they really didn't have to kill off my boy Iron Man like that but anyways the movie was great and will always be a hall of fame banger.",positive
"Very less action, No many romance, i felt i am watching romance avengers not end game.
Captain America is Thor, Doesn't make any sense to hold the Hammer of Thor why very bad chose very very bad it is not adding up.
Thor is Fat what is it suppose to be comedy now,
Fight at the end is very bad like everything everyone stuck in head of the bottle.
Very sad that i was not excepted to be like that.
Shame on the director",positive
"I'd prefered seen dumbo !
I loved infinity war, but this one is so disapointing ! It's just à other movies of 33% Ironman, 32% captain america, 31% thor. And 4% for the rest of the bande without a good scenario or strory.
Characters are not treated properly
I feel used / stole my money. Captain Marvel is not in the movies at all. Even Thanos is so badly explain...",negative

What a film been waiting and talking about it for a year and what a wait was perfect,positive
"Initially I was really excited for 3 hours movie, thinking what could have been the story. But to be honest, the story line gave me goosebumps. Endgame is the rollercoaster of happiness, excitement and sorrows. Each and every turn, there is something different. I enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed it to the pieces. Sometimes, tears of happiness and sadness rolled down.Can't give spoiler. It's a must watch.",positive
"It is a nice conclusion to the stories of Tony and Steve. The time travel concept was interesting, but using it to bring Thano's forces back, felt a bit forced",positive
"Just unbelievable, you never know what is going to happen.",positive
"My score of 7/10 does not accurately reflect my thoughts, as I reviewed this movie technically. There are many flaws, errors, preferences, etc. that bring the score down for me, yet I still sit in awe that this even exists.
I remember 2008, seeing Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk for the first times. I remember seeing The Avengers at the drive-ins after begging my mom all week. I remember going over all of the MCU movies, lined up on my shelf, trying to figure out what one I wanted to watch that night. I remember first seeing the trailer for this movie, early in the morning, waiting for German class to start.
The characters and stories in this film, built up over 11 years, come to such an astounding end, that this becomes more than a movie. A single movie cannot make me feel the emotions that I felt when the credits rolled on a 3rd viewing, it cannot convey such a love and appreciation for the fans just as much as the characters portrayed, and that is why my score is inaccurate.
Avengers: Endgame is not a movie. It is an event; and that event gets a 10/10.",positive
"Such a disappointment. They over hyped it. Too many plot holes that gave us more questions in the end. Russo brothers dropped the ball big in this one. No elaboration on the ancient one, doctor strange, hulk doesn't fight anyone, Loki disappears, and you never hear anything about vision. This movie made me cringe. If you follow the comics and a true fan of the movies then you will be lost. If you don't follow it like that then you are going to be as lost as you have ever been in any movie. This seems like the fall of the MCU.",negative
One of the best sci-fi movies out there. Story grips you from start to the end. Character development and cinematography is amazing . Movie adds emotional touch at the end . Definitely a must watch for a superhero fan.,positive
What agreat movie ! Hope from marvel to continueeeee,positive

"Endgame takes advantage of multiple genres and elements into a single movie. Involving comedy, mystery, action, drama, and fantasy. The deep character development to 8 unique individuals, instead of just one, is masterful. The contrast between war and peace, as well as the effects it has on people involved was explored on a scale never before seen. The story takes the namesake of the Avengers to a whole new level. I see this winning many Oscars. Best Picture, above all, included.",positive
"Great movie, just really annoying how they force captain marvel and make her into a ***** and have this scene with all the female heroes only on purpose. it was so forced it made me cringe. marvel wasn't in it that much, but the scenes she were in with dialogue were just horrible, she came off so smug.",positive
"Firstly, I just want to get this out there: I didn't hate this movie nor do I think it was a bad movie AT ALL. I'm not comparing this movie to any of the other current MCU movies or really any other movie altogether. How I'm rating this movie is based on the foundation leading to this pinnacle moment, one that will likely be one of the largest movie releases of all-time.One of my favorite things of this entire movie was the cinematic value. Everything from the camera work, to the directing, story-writing and scripting... even the CGI, all showed to perhaps be one of the most cohesive efforts in film history.What let me down during this movie was the essential end-result and story leading towards the final showdown with Thanos. The time travel simply felt like a cop out and easier plot to revolve around. I was really looking forward to Dr.Strange blowing our minds with his craftiness, but I was kind of face palming when they decided to use time travel in it all. It was almost anti-climatic.At the end of this movie, I just felt like the build-up to a final great battle against the strongest enemy in this universe just didn't sum up to what it could've been. Honestly, and I could be totally wrong about this, but I just felt like the last third of the movie was trying to redeem itself. The emotional strain just felt like someone was trying to get me to forget about the shortcomings of this film, but rather focus on the investment that I'd put into attaching myself to the characters and their universe.If this was a review based on the 22 movies as a single timeline or movie, then I'd give it a 10/10; the consistency of high quality work during all of these movies in almost every aspect's unrivaled. Bravo to all of the members who've worked on these movies in any way.All in all, it was a good movie. I just feel like this finale could've been the most mind-bending and crazy plot-twist in the history of film, but they settled for a tear-jerker instead.",positive
"The last 45 minutes were fully action packed. The first 2 hours more emotionally inclined mostly. Though there were a few scenes that defy logic even for avengers movies according to me, the climax leaves you with satisfaction for waiting 3 hours. Worth the imax ticket money and a year long wait!!!",positive
"While infinity war can kinda stand on its own, it is impossible to rate Endgame as a singular film. Like Jeremy Jahns said, this is chapter 12 of an odyssey, a saga, a ride of absolute pleasure for the people who have followed this journey. I truly believe this film, along with infinity war, is something that can never be replicated, not even by Marvel Studio. They'll try for sure, many more will try, but Endgame is one unique experience, something that people will never forget when they look back to the history of the great cinematic achievements.",positive
"This movie goes far far beyond the last season of Game of Thrones to become the worst expected thing of 2019. What a pain to me, what a waste of my time. Everything is just not what it should have been.
Believe or not, the comedian Thor is the best thing in this movie.
After putting second thought about the movie to write this review, I decided to rate it 1 instead of 2.",negative
"Fun and sad......both sided....but great job in maintaining the time travel thing.......superb acting
And that threat is for the 3 kills----Tony,Steve,Natasha",positive
"This is the best movie ever made. If it isn't for the haters due to the success of this movie, it probably gonna be the top 3 on imdb",positive
"The film I like the most, the storyline that makes me very memorable to watch.",positive
"Avengers:Endgame is not only the best #mcu movie,but also an emotional wreck!It's an epic conclusion to the previous 21 films!Please go watch it if you haven't,it's a must watch and you won't be disappinted!So many unexpected things will happen in this movie and I'm surprised that the things I wish to appear in the movie did ended up happening!",positive
U'll love it no matter you are a marvel fan or not.,positive
"Remember we are at the Endgame now. To be able to conclude all the 21 of interrelated marvel movies in one finale is a feat that took years of planning and perfection. All the movies to reach this epic conclusion is just a scene where you need to know its importance. A true ending that is both heart warming to a great departure of our marvel heroes. Go, watch and experience this masterpiece that will be remembered from years to come!",positive
"I was disappointed that it ended. This movie has parallels to Infinity war, and it recycles some shots from previous movies. I wasn't a huge fan of that. I think Infinity war was much tighter and a lot more smooth than this one.I loved the opening of the movie. I think that's where this movie had most of its strength within the first 20 minutes, but then it's just kinda slowly moved forward.I will give hats off to Marvel for this though they did much better than Epsiode 9 and I didn't want to believe it but it happened.",positive
"The movie wasn't that we wished and waited for it, because we thought we will see balance of action and story telling, also we were so hyped for seeing new villin on the movie, in first hr of the film, the dramma went prefectly, but in last hr, was so fast and the final battle was so short, in the end the film Is not what we I expected",positive
This movie is very boring for at least the first hour and forty five minutes,positive
"I must have watched Infinity War a dozen times, so as you can expect I was expecting big things from this movie. How wrong was I. Shockingly disappointing. The people on here giving 9 and 10's must be scoring infinity war by mistake. The film was so boring and the story was rubbish. CGI took a massive step back for me. I will not be watching this dribble again. Well unless it's on cable tv at Xmas day in 4 years time and I'm too full of dinner to get up and change the channel.",negative
"This movie is no less than a work of art. The Russo brothers made a very fitting end to the avengers story. The acting is excellent, the CGI is top notch, and the climax of the movie is epic.With that said, I must also despise the Russo Brothers. You know what you did.",positive
"This movie was a great way to end phase 3 (not including Spiderman Homecoming which is the official end). While I thought that the script teetered toward being self congratulatory at some parts, all in all it was a thrilling watch for Marvel fans and first time viewers alike. I really enjoyed how the brothers rounded out character arcs. While I knew that a lot of the phase 1 actor's contracts were up at the end of this movie, I still found myself watching the last battle while holding my breath.I would also like to give a shout out to RDJ; I really enjoyed imagining him thinking to himself ""finally retirement"" as he completed his character arc and marvel finally let him die.",positive
Best movie nothing like i think that they need to bring back iron man,positive
"Since the very first Iron Man, every thing came to this. Imagine every feeling from all these movies in just one movie.
This is without doubt the most completed movie I have ever seen.",positive
"I'll try to keep spoilers out of this review. Endgame is, in my opinion, not necessarily the best film on its own from the MCU in terms of writing and storytelling. To me, that honor still belongs to Winter Soldier. But in terms of being the final chapter of what 21 movies have been building up, I gotta say, it was phenomenal and more than satisfying while also wanting you to still revisit these characters and see where they go from here.After watching the film twice, I can say for sure now that it's by no means flawless. The first couple of hours drag on a bit too much, but damn the last act more than makes up for what they were building up towards. The film is chuck full of great fan service and action as well as emotional gut punches that I say with all honesty as a grown man made me bawl my eyes out.Is the film perfect? Not by any means. There were certain plot elements I wasn't a fan of, and like I said, the build-up to the last act is kind of draggy. But in the end, the pay-off is SO worth it, and you owe it to yourself to see this film if you've been following this franchise especially since there beginning.",positive
"When I went to the cinema, I wasn't hoping that this would be a great movie. The preceding Marvel movies hadn't been able to impress me that much. But this was way better that them. This was a result of really good writing and a lot of brilliant ideas for the narrative to move forward. The way that the story proceeded was out of the ballpark of the things I can predict. It was a bit different than the previous movies.Comedy was inserted aptly, both time wise and amount wise. The soundtrack was amazing as usual. Direction, CGI and cinematography was also pretty commendable. The action scenes, especially the final battle was extremely well executed. Dialogue could been better and could have been more. The ending didn't feel that gripping and I felt that they could have ended it sooner.",positive
"My biggest dissapointment is that they didn´t take the chance in the last movie to kill Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and not making him return. The opening scene with the always grumpy stoneface Renner almost takes all my big hopes up for the movie. He is such a horrible actor that makes it impossible to feel anything for his character. Luckily Chris Hemsworth (always great) and some of the other actors makes a good preformance and saves the day. All in all an ok action movie but didn´t like the coward option to bring almost everyone back from the dead. Killing Iron Man off is like when they killed Han Solo in Star Wars. The actor clearly wants out and it was an easy option to make this choice, not a brave/bold move from the directors.",positive
"Spoil Alert!This motion is not just amazing, i would say magnificent magnificent magnificent.But my feeling is that that happy ending doesn't make me feel any better, it is unacceptable that peace and everyone's life could be equal to TONY STARK, he sure didn't waste his life but i sure can not take his sacrifice, a world without TONY STARK ain't a world anymore, he powers up the reality, especially when he say a suit of armor around the world thing to Steve, it's a tearjerker.11 STARS ALL FOR TONY STARK!!!",positive
"First off, the 3 hour movie flew by. A good sign. But towards the end is when the movie zoomed off the rails. The Avengers fight va Thanos was great but suddenly thousands of Marvel universe heroes burst into the scene. Boring. Let's see the Super heroes not the Wakanda clan. The whole time travel premise leaves way too many questions. Should have been avoided. Why so much attention on Hawkeye? Most fans are there for Thor, Capt, Hulk. Not B level hero.Capt Marvel was a real let down. Supposedly extremely powerful but not so in End Game. And Capt America now possessing Thors hammer? Just too much.",positive
"Ever since Marvel aired the first Iron Man movie, they have been ahead in the game of superhero movies. They gave us characters we could believe in and grow to love. They showed us both the human and the hero and as audiences we started to invest in this whole franchise and their vision. Not every movie has been good or liked, but overall they were telling us a story that were leading to an end - the end that were to come in Endgame.When Infinity war aired , and we watched, we were left with sadness for the ones that were dusted and the loss that our heroes experienced. Thanos was shown as a villain but he managed to evoke sympathy in the viewer because of the loss he also experienced. Thus is was with great expectations that I went to see Endgame - for surely this was going to be huge and epic. In my first viewing, I was blown away by the emotions it managed to evoke and I thought it was great, but I walked out of the theater feeling a bit numb and reflecting back I realized why : Marvel gave us easy answers to very complex problems and questions. They went out and created a movie that paid off the fan but didn't satisfy the people that got really invested in the franchise. They made Thor a joke - Thor was epic in Ragnarok. The scene were he got his thunder is one of my favorites and even in Infinity war where he shows up is brilliant - yet here he isn't even fighting and he is a bum with jokes. To add to this, Hulk is once again played down and shown as nothing more than a bystander that doesn't even get to fight, let alone be angry.One of the strongest heroes in the universe does nothing other than pose for selfies, invents a machine and be a little ""sad"" for the sacrifice of Black Widow.
The gaping plot holes, the way they ""kill of"" Tony, Captain and Black Widow with so many unanswered questions, is sad. Captain America ""sacrifices "" himself to go put back the stones in their reality - but how does he do it? We all know the soul stone needs a sacrifice - how did he do that if he's all alone? How did he travel to all those places and do that to just then stay in the past and get his last dance with Peggy?
The final battle was messy and blah to be honest and way too short for such an ""epic"" film. I must admit, looking back now I realize I was already disappointed in the theater when every theory that has been speculated about came true in the movie. The Russos tried very hard to throw us of the scent by saying the trailers were not true or just promotional materials but it was a big let down when it turned out that most of the movie has been seen in the trailers and TV spots.
It's not a bad movie because it pays homage to its fans, but in my opinion it almost feels like they listened to those fans way to much instead of just writing it in a way that would have made more sense and maybe leave us more satisfied. I don't know what their plans are in the next phase - if we will see an Avengers movie again, but Endgame, although not bad didn't really give me the ending I was hoping for.",negative
. Sad that an era has ended. Will miss you avengers,positive
I'm just gonna say I don't think they could of made a better finale. Honestly every time I watch this movie I cry all the way through not even just at the emotional parts just because the story telling and build is so powerful. Will go down as one of my Favorited movies of all time. This is true film making.,positive
"Good ending to a great saga over 10 years, not as good as End Game but good.
Pacing a bit slow to start with but they have got to set the story ! The last fight scene really good
I must say I'm a bit surprised on some of the characters on how they ended very disappointed with Hulk and Thor !",positive
"Seen it last night & I definitely enjoyed EVERY bit of this film Stan Lee would be so proud of this film & everyone that was a part of this!! This was worth waiting for EVERYONE did such an EXCELLENT JOB making this film not only that it was also worth watching for 3 hours if anyone is really into any marvel film! I would LOVE to see it again and again! I can't wait for those that's been waiting for this day to come finally see it! I've NEVER wrote a long review like this before lol! Shoutout to EVERYONE in this movie, The Russo Brothers and lastly Stan Lee( R.I.P.) again I know he'll be so proud!",positive
"Amazing story,acting,editing,producing,directing!im not good at writing a review but im gonna try itthe movie started a couple of weeks after the and of infinity war
after 20 minutes the avengers killed thanos",positive
"And so it arrives, the culmination of nearly 11 years, 3 phases, and 21 movies, (or almost 41 hours of storytelling), Avengers: Endgame is finally upon us. And for fans that have invested their time (and money) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe over the past decade or more it is hard to see how you could be less than blown away by the epic 3 hour finale delivered by the Russo Brothers.The fan-service paid in film 22 of an incredible cinematic arc is off the charts. Which sadly means if you are coming in to Endgame with a limited knowledge of all that has gone before then your experience of this latest MCU entry will be a much poorer one for it.That is not to say if you are brand new to this universe you wont enjoy Endgame. There is LOTS to enjoy even if you don't know your Stormbreaker from your Mjölnir. But it is worth investing some time to get to know the background to this closing chapter.If you have lived through the Battle of New York, galaxy saving dance-offs, the rise of the Dark Elves, the fall of SHIELD, adventures in the quantum realm, and lack of Starbucks in Wakanda, then you are surely in for a roller coaster ride full of many emotional highs and some deeply crushing lows.It is almost impossible for me to talk about my personal favourite moments from the film without dropping spoilers. And this is an event that you really don't want spoiled for you going in. The goosebumps, the adrenaline surges, the punches to the gut in some of the rawest MCU moments to date; no one deserves to take those feelings away from you. Aside from the beauty and majesty of many of the scenes, (not least the climatic showdown), this movie has an energy that injects directly in to the veins. With that in mind I will talk about those specific heart pounding, tear duct swelling beats another time.While the Russo Brothers will invariably receive all the plaudits for Infinity War and Endgame, the contribution of writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely should not be overlooked. They have crafted an incredible story over these last two instalments encapsulating everything that has gone before with near precision. While the expectation in the action stakes was always high, and boy oh boy the action does not disappoint at all, there was always the risk that sentiment would be laid on in heavy doses. Thankfully that is not the case which is a testament to the wonderful writing of Markus and McFeely. It is a script that intertwines the complexities of the story while hitting the right notes in the right spots, especially the comedy and lighter moments which are plentiful.Endgame is not without its faults, few and minor as they are. Pacing is occasionally a little off, entirely due to some over cooked exposition of major plot points. But in the grand scheme of things these are nothing more than quibbles and entirely forgivable.While Endgame may not be the greatest, most flawless movie ever made, it is certainly up there with the best of all the Marvel movies to date. Perhaps even among the best of the superhero genre.There is one scene I do have to mention that annoyed me a little. Some are already referring to it as the ""girl power"" moment. While it was incredible to see all of the female MCU protagonists on screen at the same time, the moment for me felt incredibly forced! It was almost like someone at the last minute said, ""Hey, you know what will be really cool?"", and they shoehorned in this ""moment"". For me it deserved better than the after thought it felt like it was and will stand out for, perhaps, all the wrong reasons.In summary, Endgame is the near-perfect summer popcorn blockbuster event. And if you have been as invested in the MCU journey as I have from day one it will feel so much more than that. This is a genuine love letter from Marvel to the millions that have given so much of their time and passion to these movies and the eclectic stories and characters that have developed and entertained us over the past decade. From the opening moments it crescendos its way through your soul leaving you elated, exhilarated, and positively enthralled. And in the final minutes, with the gentlest of kisses and tenderest of goodbyes, you will be left with crushing sadness yet a feeling of contentment and satisfaction ... a very real closure to everything.And if you are new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or just have a passing interest, do yourself a huge favour. Watch Infinity Wars, at a minimum, and then get along to see Endgame. Just make it happen ... whatever it takes.",positive
"Did anyone consider how weird it would be having half the worlds population reappearing in a second after 5 years ?Thanos does have a point. Earth would be healthier and nicer with only half its humans.Infinity War was so good because it had the balls to go where it's headed. Balls like never before in such a movie were heroes can die 10 ten times without ever dying at all.
I did think this was too good to be true. They'll probably land a cheap trick and drown that whisky.",positive
"I must say, that the movie left me completely speechless. It's a true masterpiece. You also get a lot of questions from past movies answered. Most certainly I am gonna watch it again.
Everything is perfect, all the scenes for a hardcore Marvel fan as myself.",positive
"After Avengers: Infinity War, the stage was set was something bigger and until the point of release of Avengers: Endgame, the trailers, social media, everything created an atmosphere that indeed Avengers: Endgame was something bigger.But sadly, while watching the movie I realized, that it was not. It was just another one time watch movie, made for formality of just ending the story.I didn't like Endgame on many levels as compared to Infinity War. Yes any movie, which is sequel or a prequel should be compared to its predecessor.Infinity War succeeded in handling so many characters and storylines, Endgame failed miserably.Thanos had such a strong presence in Infinity War which was missing in Endgame. It came in, too late.Infinity War moved at a steady pace without a dull moment, whereas in Endgame there was no consistency. The slow parts of the movie were too slow and at times things happened too fast.Its not that there were only bad parts in the movie, there were some good/great moments too, especially in the climax but it was just too rushed. Things happening without any reason or logic.Hope someone could snap this movie out of existence and create a new one!",positive
"I'm a comic guy from way back and don't particularly like the movie versions, so take that for what it's worth.My mistake was seeing it at a midnight showing. I didn't think I was tired, but I guess I was as I ended up falling asleep for about 30 minutes.So here's the bottom line for me. I really don't care about the plot holes. Many reviewers have mentioned them. For me, it's about the scenes. Are they done well? Realistic dialogue? Interesting or exciting action. Actors who are fun to watch. Is this a movie I would watch twice? That is my baseline for any movie to be what I consider ""good""Unfortunately, Endgame fails on all accounts really. It starts off extremely slowly. You could take off the first hour and you wouldn't miss much at all. The action? Nothing really clever or compelling for me. The big Ant Man was kind of cool. Massive amounts of political correctness was expected and delivered, but that will lower ratings for any movie that I watch. Too many wooden characters, however I expect that.In conclusion, I couldn't watch this one twice as it's simply too boring and I like slow paced movies. Too schmaltzy at the end. Yes, it's over, but don't worry though, almost all of these guys will be back, just with different actors playing the roles.",negative
I want to give it 10 stars but the fact that it has to force some political views (ex. The clearly forced all female Avenger scene) means it doesn't deserve a 10 star rating.,positive
The marvel universe creators managed to create an overwhelming ending with great plot and substitial history for the almost 3 hours endgame. Congratulations I'm very happy to have lived this universe. Gonna miss you all.,positive
"I really wanted it to be a 10/10! With awesome CGI and pretty good Story telling, it had a lot of great, funny, and sad moments. But Time Travel is a hard topic to explain and i have to many open questions for some Scenes in the Past. Infinity War was a great ""Pre-Endgame"" but unfortunately even better them the real Endgame!",positive
"The Avengers supposed final movie is a great movie, well not as great as Infinity War, still a great movie. This time, the action is less, far less with a huge part of it bringing out an emotional and serene reunion of the characters who survived Thanos' (the formidable antagonist) purge. Though I expected Gamora to play a prominent role in Thanos destruction, I liked their (with Nebula) making amends. What I really loved on the movie is the prominence of the role of Captain America the most concrete and consistence character. Afterall, he is the first Avenger, the kid from Brooklyn who didn't like bullies and would stand up to them. In the face off with Thanos and his army, even the mighty Thor is in Captain's shadow.
For you to fully enjoy and connect the time travel, watch the other three movies. It is a must watch with a strong theme of justice, honor and family. Its conclusion is indisputable, get the movie..Avengers Assemble!!!",positive
You can't rate this movie because it's not a movie it's a saga of 15 Years a conclusion and you can't rate a conclusion you just watch and enjoy it.,positive
"GREAT ENDING.
Thor and Captain give me the greatest surprise.",positive
"Avengers Endgame literally blew me away. I just came back from the cinema and I am still amazed and shocked from what I have just watched. This movie is full of humour, action, sadness and as well as bringing back memories from the previous MCU movies. Avengers Endgame is the best superhero film yet and is the best way to end the Infinity Saga. It's also gonna be hard to try not to spoil anything!",positive
"My favourite movie of all time. I love every minute of it and I'll be rewatching it many times in my life. The movie brings the franchise back down to some of it's core members to really delve into their unique perspectives on the events of the past film. It gives many of the characters very satisfying endings to their arks, and sets up other characters really well to carry on their legacy.If you've not seen a marvel movie before, I highly recommend catching up with the other ones first, but this is a must see for everyone.",positive
"When you see the movie, you may feel like lets give 10/10 for it. But when you come back home and think it may not be worth it. A good film is which follows you even when you are out of theater.
Issues with the film
1) pace of the film. This is the most slow paced film in the series I guess. Easily this could be ended in 2:30 hrs or little more action would have been better
2)plot holes: plot holes in some films, we tend to ignore because we are carried away by the whole scene/movie. But in this, some questions keep on hitting us even inside theater.Overall I like the movie. It is watchable of course. And the way main story is developed is good. Most of us won't expect the way it unwinds.
And the way they treat Thor and Hulk will be unbearable for their hardcore fans/comic book fans. Since I am a captain fan, I find it awesome for his scenes.",positive
"This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Visuals, the actresses and actors, and plot. Everything linked up. I love this film and would recommend it to anyone.",negative
This movie is amazing! Its a must see movie! Please watch this movie it has so much fun and exciting things in it.,positive
This film was done so well. The 3rd act I will say in my lifetime will never happen again. This movie brings all the feelings inside to life 10 fold. I love this movie,positive
"The 3rd act was the most EPIC moment in the MCU by far. You kinda have to watch the other MCU movies to really enjoy it, so if you haven't watched any MCU movie yet, now it's the time.",positive
This movie blew me away. I don't want to reveal any spoilers but omg. The film made me laugh and cry. Also nearly made me have an heart attack. The performances was so good. It was brilliant. I think I might go watch it another 2 times.,positive
"The entire Marvel journey has been well placed together to create a fitting conclusion. The Endgame culmination is a master piece and is a treat to all the fans. It will leave them speechless, satisfied, emotional, thrilled, and thoroughly entertained all at the same time. I never felt like I had been there for 3 hours in the theater. In fact I was almost sad when I sensed the climax approaching.",positive
"Lets review The ENDGAME! Mind will say it all.. buggy , cud hv done this, first one was better , plot holes.. but here give yourselves chance to feel.. witness.. this epic saga comng to an satisfactory, nostalgic end. also even a day long movie couldn't be enough to conclude this 10 year long journey of 21 movies.. Book your tickets now! After all this zenith deserves a farewell too!",positive
It was a good film but I think they could of made this significantly better. The big battle wasn't as epic as I was hoping for. Thanks was needed more in this film. The film also focused on its weaker characters too much and boy did I hate the Hulk. The Hulk is such a huge figure and yet we never really saw him in both avengers films. I feel that this film is completely overrated. This is possibly the worse of the 4 avengers films there has been.,positive
"To me, Endgame was an uneven movie. The character driven first hour was a highlight. A whole range of emotions were on display, as were the acting chops to execute them. One grouse though - having a gay character was totally fine... but I came across several articles prior to watching the film, making it a big deal. Honestly, Why?! It's not like seeing LGBTQ characters in film and TV is revolutionary in this day and age...The middle hour however, while entertaining and a necessary plot device to that epic final, was just that- middling! Suffice to say, the logic made me go ""ehh?!?!"" . Time travel movies- always a slippery slope. But the underhanded shout out to a time traveling film was funny though. This hour is where most of the humor was crammed into. I am starting to wonder if Disney has a quota of one liners and humor per film, that absolutely needs to be met. A lot weren't very funny and seemed out of place. It did have some nice reunion moments.The last hour was epic! A lot of applause and whistles from the audience, a couple of scenes in particular! Followed by several goodbyes and sign-offs. While the aren't any post credits scehes, the closing sequence was nicely done; a befitting close to the final chapter.It was nice to see a lot of characters from the other MCU films make brief appearances.I didn't quite like The Hulk's New iteration. He has always been my favorite character. Here he was just grating . Thor's appearance while funny initially, stopped being so fairly quickly. He deserved better.MVP - A lot of people have pegged RDJ. I thought he was indeed spectacular, but Jeremy Renner gets my vote!Taken as a whole, I prefer infinity War to Endgame, but the latter is a worthy bookend, despite what I perceived as plotholes and flaws.",positive
"First comes first - this is a great movie to wrap up the arcs of the original Avengers (excluding Thor, I guess?..)
If you feel attracted to any of them - it is definitely a nice experience.Now off to the weak points.
Many, many people complain about ""dumb time travel""... I personally don't mind if you throw any plot devices at me as long as the characters are interesting to watch and the plot devices don't contradict anything else in the movie. So I'm fine with it. Apart from one crucial point. There is literally no point in sending the whole team to get the stones. Send IronMan+Cap+Hulk three times in a row to retrieve all of the stones - they are a lot more reliable and resourceful than Hawkeye or freakin' Nebula... Much to my dissapointment I have to say - this stupidity is added to plug in Thanos to modern day from the past.
And this act crushed the movie quite a bit for me.As we know the superhero movies are as good as their villains are. And half of the charm of Infinity War was due to an extremely charismatic villain. But not only charismatic - he was extremely dangerous as well. All the events of Infinity war unfolded as Thanos wanted them to. All our protagonists were fighting against a well layed out plan of the villain, desperately trying to disrupt it.
Thanos in Infinity War is a dangerous, cunning, resourceful villain, who has a nearly perfect plan of annihilating half of the Universe.But who is Thanos from Endgame? Well, he's physically strong... And got to oppose our protagonists out of pure luck, without a single action taken on his side. He's boring. And thus the whole final act the stakes are not as high - Thanos didn't plan all his, he's simply lucky to get his hands on the stones. Boring villain = boring climax.To fully defeat Thanos from Infinity war apart from overpowering him you'd also have to break his firm beliefs about decimating the population.
To fully defeat Thanos from Endgame... Punch him. Really, really hard.I wonder if the writers actually understood this horrible thing they did to Thanos and the movie in general? And if it was the reason they symbolically killed ""old Thanos"" at the beginning of the movie...",positive
"I had high hopes going into this movie, I liked IW and would give it 8/10 and hoped for this to be much better but I was disappointed. The fact that every fan theory already had solved the plot about this time travel idea a whole year before the release is proof that the plot is bad. I feel like they tried to make as many viewers as happy as possible and therefore didn't take risks which in my opinion was a bad decision. The movie is overly long and I was extremely bored after two hours and the last fight didn't make up for my boredom. I will admit though, when I first left the cinema I would've probably given this a 7 cause the last minutes are fairly intense and enjoyable as every bit of the puzzle comes together. But the more I found myself thinking about the movie the worse it became, that's why I'd rate it a 5/10.",negative
"Helt utrolig fantastisk. Mye action, mye humor og litt trist.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is the perfect epic ending to the brilliant Avengers franchise. It succeds in mixing features of an intense dramatic movie with a superhero one. Powerful performances and the beautiful mind of the Russo Brothers make this movie worth to be seen more than only once. This is soon gonna be a cult movie. Rating: 9,5",positive
"You will literally shout your lungs out for every scene. Every piece of action is pure bliss. You will laugh, you would cry but you will be gasping a like a baby for the final third act battle. The way they introduced the concept of time travel in MCU was very easy to understand and the exposition was humourously put so that even newbies could get it. Those who have seen the other 21 movies, they will tend to catch some of most emotional moments and references in the movie. Totally worth more than I paid.",positive
"My 3000 love is far from enough.Humors, actions and every entries are damned so glorious. I'm beyond speechless about this movie. Can I rate 12/10? I think marvel really put very serious effort on this movie.Every moment is so precious.Btw, even this movie has 3hrs screentime, but this is the first time I experienced that no person went to the toilet during a movie! love the enthusiasm of the premiere launching in my country, love the applause, and really love the appreciation given until the very last moment the movie started the credit scene.I do encourage my relative to put efforts on watching the whole avengers series to experience the greatest outcome from this movie.Yes, this is beyond great. Thank you marvel studio.",positive

It is not a 3h action film like many people wanted (not me), but is so well worked in all aspects, like CGI is so well done, very funny parts, argument... Men, just go see this! In many parts ive been surprised with very unexpected scenes, and you sure will too. Just trust and dont lose this absolut movie.",positive

"SPOILER ALERT!
IF YOU HAVEN""T WATCH IT, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, DON'T READ REVIEWS YET, GO WATCH IT FIRST. OTHERWISE, YOU WILL GET SPOILED.
Everything has an explanation.If you didn't do a marathon watching the 21 marvel movies before Endgame (or at least 12 of the essential movies), you will probably end adding a negative review about Endgame.1st: Why Captain America was able to use Thor's hammer? (And some say: ""the cap used even better than Thor, how?""). OK, here is why.You have to go back to Thor's and Captain America's movies. Back in Thor (2011), Thor committed an act of war that put the lives of millions of people on risk, so he demonstrated not to be worthy, so Odin exiled Thor, removing his rights to use the hammer. Odin said ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor"". In the same movie, Thor tried to pick up the hammer, and he wasn't able to do it because he was not worthy. The keyword here is ""Worthy"". At the end of the movie, when Thor sacrificed his life to save the world, then he demonstrated to be worthy, and then the hammer came back to him. Then, going back to Captain America's movies, from the very beginning, when Steve Rogers was not a superhero yet, in several occasions, he demonstrated to be worthy, including that moment on which he jumped over a pomegranate to save the lives of people that were just bullying him. In fact, he was chosen to become a super soldier, because of was worthy to become super powerful (did you watch Captain America the First Avenger?) if not, you won't understand anything about the cap. The movies after that, he also continues to give his life for others, putting himself on risk to save the world (even before having any power).Remember that fun scene in Age of Ultron on Thor is making fun of everybody because nobody can pick up the hammer? But when Captain America tried, Thor gets surprised because when Captain America make his try, the hammer moves, but then cap is so humble that look at Thor and then doesn't pick it up, maybe he was not fully worthy at that moment yet?. If you look back in the comics, the cap picked up the hammer a couple of times.2nd: Why Captain America took the hammer with him at the end of the movie when going back in time to return the infinity stones? This is not revealed in Endgame, but he was definitively returning everything back, maybe the Hammer was one of those things, so it won't mess Thor's timelines. Thor needed that hammer in the past, that's a reason.3rd: Why Captain America was able to use the StormBreaker? The StormBreaker doesn't has the magic from Odin. So anybody with enough strength can use it. Is not the hammer that has the magic from Odin.4th: Why Captain America appears as an old man, at the end of the movie? C'mon guys! You don't know this? Really? Again, watch Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and also watch Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and you will find all answers. He had a pending dance with the love of his life, the woman with who he wanted to get old together. Remember in the Winter Soldier, he said to her (on her deathbed) ""we still have a pending dance"". That's why the movie ends with that dance! And c'mon! He deserves a life too! That's why he just appears as an old man in front of the lake, because he used the time travel to have a life and get old with his woman! Jesus! C'mon! Please tell me that you get it.5th: Why Captain Marvel doesn't really stick around to show off all her infinite power to just defeat Thanos? The simple answer is, because you guys hate her!!! If Marvel gives the main role to Captain Marvel, most of the Marvel fans will get pissed! C'mon tell if I am right or wrong?About the Timeline Mess-up: Yes, I understand, time travel in so many stories, it brings new time lines, and this leaves some unanswered questions. Now let's look at the future. Did you see the new Spider-man trailer? Nick Fury calls Spider-man to resolve a mess with the new timelines. In fact, he ask ""why you didn't call Captain Marvel"", they answer ""She is not available"". The real answer is ""She is not that popular, the fan base hate her, that's why we called you, Spider-man"". Also after Tony Stark death, which movie you think is more profitable? Either a Spider-man movie or Pepper's movie, right? But people won't really like Pepper as they already like Spider-man. So who is the go-to person now? Spider-man. And the probe of this is that he sets a new record in trailer views. Everybody wants to know what's next! That's why Spider-man is the man now. He was Iron man's pupil, and he still wears the suit made by Iron Man. So Spider-man is at the same time new Iron-man? And he is going to resolve some of the mess-up caused by the time travel? Well let me tell you, this is much better than having almost all superheroes dead.Do you guys really thing the planning for a movie with a budget of $356,000,000 (estimated), is just about a few guys just sitting and inventing random stories without analyzing? Nope. That's a lot of people thinking and challenging each other when a new idea comes out. Almost everything in this movie makes sense and is referenced from prior movies. And anything that doesn't makes sense yet, will makes sense in the future, in the next movies.My only concern in this movie is who dies. I still don't accept it. I can accept black widow death because she has a contract for a prequel, so we are going to watch much more about her. But Ironman! C'mon! Why him? You lost black widow, and we are losing the cap, and Ironman too? Marvel you sacrifice too much. We can still enjoy the movie without so many sacrifices. That's my only concern. Yes, I am still sad about who died. But I have to accept it. Let me tell you, if all the good guys always survive, and all the bad guys always die, in every single movie you watch, then what's the point? You will know the end already! But Marvel is giving us stories that keeps us thrilled because we cannot predict it (unless you have been spoiled of course). These are movies in where anything can happens, as they says ""whatever it takes"". But hey, I am still sad. Sad! Very Sad! Why him? This is the only reason why I would hate Marvel.Well, in overall, Avengers: Endgame, is the end of an era, and it is the most epic ending you couldn't even imagine.It took them more than a decade to make this movie. All of those 21 prior movies point to this one, and this on point back to the prior movies too. You may be surprised of finding also some references from the comics.Some of my favorite parts are the references to all the 21's prior movies to this one. But this is also a double-edged sword, because it is good for people that really remember those movies, but bad for those that are not fans, didn't watch the prior movies, and don't know what is going on.Another good mention about Endgame and all Marvel movies is that they are bordering the lines between science and science fiction. Marvel Studios prides itself on scientific continuity throughout its many movies, and this movie really made it in that direction. They give a drama story and origin to each super hero, and they also explain their powers and how these characters obtained these powers. Most of the story is actually based on scientific theories (the quantum physics), and how far a civilization can go if some of these theories are exploded. So can we become super heroes and travel back in time? Hey, I haven't say that. But if you are a science enthusiast, you will love how Marvel does it with science fiction.Marvel make us become children again by the time we sit to watch their movies.Everything in this movie is above and beyond amazing, in combination with the full sequel (as I mentioned above). The story and screenplay, the art direction, the acting, sound mixing, visual effects, engineering effects, music, cinematography, costume design (as always), action, drama, comedy, film editing, everything. No negative critics. Would it earn or be nominated to an Oscar? Well, I think Avengers in overall has the potential to add another category to the Oscars: 'Best Sequel'. Yeah! Why not? As I said, if you judge this movie itself without watching the entire 22 avenger's movies, it won't be a fair judgement! Period. Oscar's committee, please take that in mind.Would I watch it again! Yes, I'm going back to the movie theater, to watch it a couple of times more. And then when it gets released in Blu-Ray, I will watch it again about 4 times more. For real, it is fun to watch!",positive
"I was very excited for Endgame and due to social media I was pretty scared of my viewing being ruined so I stayed away from all social media sites and luckily made it to the screen!Engame focuses on the use of Time Travel, I enjoy time travel films but it can be utterly confusing depending on how its done! I believe that it is on the utterly confusing side of the table but I did begin to understand it during each stage of the film. But I believe that the film itself didn't really follow its own rules of time travel and that is why I left slightly confused on the actual date the film ended on by the closing credits. After a little research It all became quite clear.I'm glad a lot of certain characters got there time to shine within Endgame as Hawkeye and Antman did not make an appearance within Infinity War, it was great to see them take part and see how they had changed due to the events of the previous film. Hawkeye was especially awesome to see how the events had changed him and became a sort of John Wick assassin.The film has alot of nostalgic moments with the use of time travel we are able to go back and visit previous films and view them from different angles. Its alot of fun to see and provides alot of comedic value and the return of previous characters we've enjoyed from other films. Its quite a grand scale of characters we see in this film.The film takes us 5 years into the future (2023) after the events of Infinity War (2018) and its great to see how this has changed our characters and what there lives may be. The film i believe now also ends in 2023 so i'm interested to see how this has affected characters such as Peter Parker as some of his class may have aged 5 years while others like him are the same again but 5 years later? Its confusing. I wonder if Far from home will go along with this.The ending result is extremely satisfying but i didn't feel an emotional connection to the characters as those in the cinemas did as I heard alot of sniffling and could see people wiping there eyes from the Major death scene. I believe for me this is due to the fact that Marvel rarely have permanent deaths and so my belief is that there is never really that much risk.I really enjoyed the film it gave lovely endings and possible futures for other characters. It's not amazing like everyone says but I had a great time throughout!",positive
"First of all it's a very loooooooong movie. 3 hrs.
I was waiting for this one for months now, so excited at what was going to come. But Alas.. What a mess.
The first hour is a complete boring time of them showing what the world has come to. I mean quite boring with slight humor.
Second hour, the movie starts picking up, with more content (confusing time travel) and some good humor.
The last hour (like when you are actually asking where's the action, where are the effects, 3D etc), it's starts to show some hope. And some action starts. Gets you going.. For a bit.. And then it ends.
The action is hardly there.. Whatever is there is forgettable. Nothing worth like the earlier ones.
Overall the movie is not a little below average, with nothing memorable in it. I can't believe the business is done.
I came home and had to watch Infinity War to get over this one. And believe me folks... Infinity War was way better than this. Way way better with its story and action.
Don't waste your money on this melodrama.. Watch it on TV when it comes...",negative
This is truly history in the making. I am very proud to be a part of it. The acing was superb. The graphics were colorful. The action was over-packed with awesomeness and the story-line is definitely the best there is. I am hoping to see this movie to win at least one Academy Award. Thank you Russo Brothers for giving us this spectacular moment and of course thank you Stan Lee for once again sharing yor outstanding creation with the world.,positive
"I'm just speechless what I saw. You just need to see this movie. 21 movies, 10 years and a perfect conclusion of this saga. Avengers: Endgame is the best superhero movie ever. It's just have everything to get satisfied. I'm not that emotional in life but this movie, this damn movie... It's just breaks you. Avengers: Endgame was very important for me even that I'm not that very Marvel fan but damn.. I'm just happy how it ended.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is the penultimate film in Phase Three and the Infinity Saga. The film was directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson and other eminent actors. This is an action, fantasy, drama film that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects.The film is a direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War. The plot tells the events after Thanos' Snap. The heroes have to deal with all the problems and develop a new plan that will return people's lives back to normal.The film is the largest superhero movie ever made. All the films in the MCU have formed a connection and brought us to the end of the story. A lot of directing work has been done. Thanks to which the viewer will not be able to take his eyes off while watching. Of course, there are plot holes in the film. But you do not pay attention to them at the first viewing. After all, the film will fascinate you with its special effects. So the Oscar was well deserved. The film is 181 minutes long. This is longer than the average duration, but it does not get worse from this. The main meaning that the author tried to convey is that there is always hope, the main thing is not to give up. And he was able to show the audience everything he wanted in these 3 hours. The film has some illogical moments and scenes that fans will not like. The humor in the film is lame in places, especially the moments with Thor, which the writers tortured. If you have not watched many previous films of this studio, then you will not understand some points and you will not be able to properly sympathize with the characters. Therefore, based on all this, I recommend watching the film only after you have familiarized yourself with the plot of the studio's past projects. Or, well, children.",positive
"It was really hurtful for me...Since a kid they were my childhood heroes..And now you guys end it like my all emotion multiplying 3000 times.....

"Watched Avengers: Endgame twice on its premiere screening day, it's absolutely amazing, the story is well put, doesn't matter if sometimes I still keep checking my watch, I had no intention of leaving the theater on both occasion.To my surprise, there are more female audience during the screening, and hearing their chatters and reactions clearly shown that they are as invested as me about this movie. It was all a good time.I know I left a bad review about Captain Marvel but in this movie, she's more or less justifiable in both her action and personality. I know there are some feminism at the final war scene, but I don't think it's bothering me so much, as I enjoy the sisterhood in action this time.I am trying my best not to spoil anything here, it's all my personal opinion that this was one of the best cinema experience I had in a while, had waited for this for a year, it's worth it.",positive
"O My God! What a villian. I have ever seen this type of strongest villian who had fought with all avengers. His performance is also good. And i love the climax scene where all avengers comes with doctor strange and assemble with thor, captain america and ironman . And the fighting scene is awesome.....",positive
"It was amazing!! Don't get me wrong.
But GOSH they packed this film... so I almost feel it was rushed to tie up all the loose ends!! Felt like it ""zoooomed"" by!Also, urghhhh I cannot help to feel that some characters were done in.Thor - why?? He was funny and all, but SJO the turn they made with him in this movie was a little sad!! Where's the Thor Ragnarok! I get he's had a rough past getting to this point, but eish. I do not think his character had a fair ending. And he was especially one of my alll along. So this ending for him was rough.Captain Marvel - could've featured more not just pop up everytime as the last hope! Her character seemed flat in this one and I actually loved her stand alone movie. So why release her movie RIGHT before this one, just for her to be forgotten - come onnnnnnnnn!!Fury - really, not even one word???Loki - not at least one reference???Capt america - not so much excited about falcon becoming capt america- but oh well I guess he will grow on me. Gonna miss Chris Evans, though!!!!Ironman - nope... will never get over it!!😢😢😢SO MANY PLOTHOLES.
My biggest peeve is that Thanos is suddenly SO strong (without the stones) that Capt Marvel cannot even stop him? Or he can suddenly stop Thor's new axe??? Really??? Come onnnnnnn.
And then Capt America is made the HERO with THOR's hammer?? It's quirky and all... but I would've accepted it easier if Thor was not made out to be such a big joke in this film already. So - not cool. He's actually quite epic and not what this film did with his character - haha maybe I am more peeved about Thor then I thought!! 🤣🤣Did feel it was very much and iron man / capt america movie- granted they are legit. But the other characters are just as strong!! Why undersell them. Oi.Oh well so all in all I cannot say I have a completely ""satisfied"" feeling in the end. It was good and I cried QUITE a bit!! Lol.So sad when something so legend has to end 😞",positive
No one could predict the endgame of the Endgame before.,positive
"Endgame is, in my opinion, certainly overrated. That's not to say I didn't like it, it's just not nearly as good as many people make it out to be. My eleven year old son loved it, but I expected more. Maybe my expectations were too high, I'll admit that. After all, it's an action movie with little substance at its core. It's wrapped in all the bells and whistles and quite often delivers an adequately exciting ride, but unfortunately it's just a bit of a mess. The bits that are meant to be heartfelt fell flat for me, riddled with improbable scenarios. Not the type of scenarios that involve godlike aliens wielding ultra powerful rocks, those are to be expected in this type of movie. The scenarios I'm referencing as improbable are the poorly derived emotional moments that just seem to have no structure and lack consistency, detracting from the effectiveness of the characters. Overall Endgame is a worthwhile watch, but not a worthy final stanza. It fell short of being the finale it could have been due to a messy plot and melodramatic tendencies.",positive
"Dont miss understand my title, I'm a huge fan of the Avengers, even more I have watched the 20 movies for the past month in anticipation for the ENDGAME.. However after watching it I'm really disappointed 😥 for the below:
1- First half an hour was really disappointing. I mean after making a full movie on Thanos, the avengers killed him that easily !!!! Come on .. the writers shouldn't expect us to be this fool?
2- Thor being fat and not funny ?? Comeon he fought battles and lost all of his family and friends & Asgard & he was still standing ?? So what changed that he became that desperate?? Totally un believeable and weird.
3- Time Travel ??? Are we in the 90s or 80s !!! Comeon it's so lame and unbelievable.. otherwise Stark should have thought about it straight after thanos happened, & not wait for an ANT stupid as a rock to tell him.
4- Killing the black widow is not believable ?? Since when they love each other that much ??? Doesnt this arrow man has wife and kids & black widow love Hulk !!
5- We all new that iron man was going to be killed , so no surprise in that??
6- No action whatsoever, as the only 20 minutes came from the ending were everyone was already starting to sleep, & it was not so good.Overall, long wait to end up with bullocks, very disappointing writing , & 3 hours of wasting time .... Wish they had put more thought in it , and give the fans an enjoyable movie, instead of this waste of time.",negative

"Writing a review on this movie is a walking by minefield but I should.
So, Avengers Endgame is the ending of more than twenty pictures which covered ten years of history. Moreover, it's sequel of Avengers Infinity War.
For all that time we've seen a lot of characters and it's impossible to give them well-balanced screentime. Because of it as main characters we have leftovers of Avengers in team. They survived after Thanos Click. But don't worry. You'll see all characters of MCU. Even Valkiria, even Hank Pim.
Avengers Endgame screenplay plays with a very dangerous kinda stuff - timetravelling. And, worth recognize that all lines of screenplay are ended. Big respect to all scenario team.
For a three hours u'll see everything what u like in MCU - balance between jokes and serious speeches (which snatched from all ancient greek tragedies), balance between character powers and influence of it on epic points of movie. And, for sure, balance between fan-service and common sense. So, all like Thanos said. Perfect balance.
Few words about Thanos too. Like main evil of MCU, he sucks. But wait. There are Thor in his best form and best epic battle since Lord of The Rings!
Bad motivation is covered by these two factors. You don't need to think about logic or physics in this movie.
If you are just like me watching MCU movies since 2008 - this movie is for you. Be prepared to crying like a baby because of all kinds of fan service.
Does this circus have a meaning? Of course!
Creators having fun, Tony Stark jokes, Captain America watches on everything with most serious view, Black Widow spells more than ten words for all movie. Everything is usually. Thanks to Marvel Studios for these ten years. I'll wait for next movies in MCU.",positive
"Let me start off by saying that large parts of this movie i liked, i have after all been living & breathing these movies much in the same way i have done the comic books my whole entire life. But sadly after this movie i left the cinema with the first bitter pill in my mouth for a long long time. Something about finality and saying goodbye never feels ok but in the context of many genres of film this is something we have all learned to deal with. In a comic book world though this is something that although sometimes broken is the one constant you can take from it. Real life sucks but in the world of Iron Man, Spider-Man & Cap & the like you know that you can always escape from the banality of a working life to the worlds that encapsulate the wonder & intensity of a life you secretly crave. I Feel sadly that in this day & age it seems a nessessity for film makers to have to use death to finalise a process, some even yearn for it, why so many fans complained that marvel didn't kill enough of their characters off before now is completely lost on me. Have they not read the books these characters come from? If your building a world, serialising it, would Stan Lee think that killing off Spider-Man for example half way through his first run would have been a good idea? a great way of bringing sadness into his excellent adventure? Yes Marvel Films are trying to bring things more down to earth, more realistic but do they really need to. The Excitement i used to feel before every new Marvel Movie i fear is going to be lost now. That's not all that's wrong with Endgame. I Felt like everywhere you looked something was slightly amiss. Time Travel Holes notwithstanding (You cannot make a time travel movie without holes, never) But i felt that the worst offender here was Captain's Arc, it may on surface feel like a nice poetic way for him to bow out but really? would Cap ever put his shield down for himself, the sheer essence of the character is he will never stop fighting the good fight, not even for himself. That's not to mention going back in time & hooking up with Peggy would mean her kids would never be born! not the act of a selfless patriot. Yes they wanted so much to give these great actors a royal sendoff but at the expense of everything they had built up until now. So sad that we have to now watch those older films knowing that these versions of the characters are actually not those versions we loved so much from those comics we read as a kid. Endgame has some moments of splendour. Cap standing solo against the might of Thanos & his army is one of the shots of the century, also his roll call of 'Avengers Assemble' a line we have waited for a long time (The End of Ultron doesn't count as he never completes it) Rocket Raccoon & Thor again seem to be almost the perfect buddy comedy in waiting. Jeremy Renner also stands out in this film a lot more than previous & get's some meaty action & dialogue & Once again Tom Holland manages to affect me with his acting chops with his final scenes, no mean feat as i feel Homecoming was the weakest entry in the marvel cannon up until now. Also Paul Rudd does what he always does best & brightens every scene he is in & the Women of Marvel have their golden 'Libertators' moment in the final battle with Valkyrie & The Scarlet Witch both showing what they are made of. But it's the fatal flaws of this movie that stand out for me much more than those great moments that a 3 hour Marvel movie will always have. The Golden Rules are broken in this one because someone thought it needed to happen but not thinking about it's core audience, not thinking about the world in which they have almost seamlessly constructed over the last 11 years. Actors move on yes, but these characters live on in their worlds because that's their job, to take us away from the mundane, to encourage us to be better, to give us something to look forward to. Endgame on the whole feels a little generic, like someone really just wanted to put a giant dot above the I. People have been hailing this film as a masterpiece, my only feeling about this is that they are the ones not completely invested in this universe, no true fan of Marvel Comics can walk out of the theatre feeling satisfied about this film, they just can't. When the dust settles i feel that the huge mistakes, gambles even with this movie will really shine through & Endgame will not feel like the satisfactory conclusion of this saga that they actually really wanted. 6/10 for the moments of greatness but on the whole i wanted to score it less for reasons mentioned.",positive
"Is this the end or can the Avengers pull off one last miracle? After a 11 year journey that spans across 22 films for a total of 3000 minutes of screen time, the Marvel saga's final tale is being told (Coyle, 2019). After watching Avengers: Endgame, which is just over 3 hours long, it was very satisfying to see how all of the movies are interconnected into one movie. You will laugh and you will also cry while hanging on every word of dialogue because you don't want the movie to end. Avengers: Endgame is everything that an action hero fantasy sci-fi movie should be by finding a way to give all of the Marvel heroes a role to play in the movie.
The Marvel journey began all the way back in 2008 with Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man. I think that Downey expertly portrays Tony Stark who described himself in 2012's ""The Avengers"" as a ""Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist"" by combining humor, charisma and is an absolute master at the ""one liner"". Despite Stark's many character flaws and personality quirks, he's a good man and you find yourself rooting for him. Even though there are 22 different Marvel movies, there is always a reference to Iron Man/Tony Stark.Chris Evans, who plays Cpt. Steve Rogers, aka: Captain America, does an excellent job of bringing the character to life. While Captain America is the oldest Avenger, he is also the strongest. Possibly the only person that could lift up Mjolnir, the hammer of the God of Thunder, Thor. I believe that Chris Hemsworth was destined to play the role of Thor. Standing at 6'-3"" tall with long blonde hair, he is a perfect match to Thor from the comic books.""Avengers: Endgame"" takes place 5 years after Thanos' ""snap"" that wiped out 50% of all living things. While half of the Avengers are scattered across different locations around the globe, as well as the universe, trying to pick up the pieces after ""The snap"", most of the remaining heroes are headquartered at the Avenger's base in New York. However, some of the heroes have seemed to have lost their sense of identity. One is mad at the world and is trying to rid the world of the remaining evil, while the other has turned into a slacker with a beer belly.One constant in the Marvel ""cinematic universe"" has been Stan Lee, the creator of the Marvel Universe. Sadly, Lee passed away on November 12th, 2018 and did not get to see the joy that ""Avengers: Endgame"" brought to the world. However, across the 22 movie arc, each director has found a way to give Lee a small but memorable cameo in every movie. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is no different. ""Endgame definitively closes a few chapters in the Avengers saga in highly satisfying fashion. It is a tremendously entertaining intergalactic trip"" (Warner, 2019, p.1).While ""Avengers: Endgame"" is no longer in theaters, you have multiple options to enjoy this masterpiece of a film. Marvel is now owned by Disney and can be viewed on ""Disney Plus"" for a monthly subscription of $6.99. You can also find ""Avengers: Endgame"" on Blu-Ray and DVD at any retailer for $19.99. For an overall score for ""Avengers: Endgame"", I would give it ""11 out of 10 stars"". It's just that good. This movie is rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi violence and action and some language. I think the audience needs to prepare for an emotional roller coaster while watching this movie. I think that it is helpful to understand the movie better if you have seen all of the other Marvel movies as all of the other movies are interconnected. I think ""Avengers: Endgame"" is an excellent buy because it is a fitting conclusion to the 22 movie story arc.",positive

"What a waste of time! Let's start by: Why the hell did they put Thor dumb, fat, drunk, a loser, and as the laughing stock?? And why on earth was the Hulk smaller, thinner, weaker and stupid?? Why was Thanos stronger without the infinity stones?? And can someone tell me why Captain Marvel was so useless - it was pointless having her in this film; I have no idea why they worked so hard in adding her character into the film, when she clearly did absolutely nothing! Captain Marvel failed along with the whole other 150 woman failed. Girl power at its best. Captain Marvel was powerless, pointless and ridiculed in front of the world watching this stupid film. I'm sorry, 20 Avengers and none of them couldn't do anything??? And why did Tony had to die out of all the other characters?? Seriously, couldn't Falcon, Dr. Strange or Mantis die instead - they were good for nothing. And how did Falcon get to be Captain America? What about Bucky-- War Machine-- heck even Rocket would have been better. A good 45 minutes of poor blah blah that could have been used for action fight scenes. Disappointments everywhere.",negative

"After the spectacular Infinity War, I was expecting a masterpiece to finish off the saga. I was a little disappointed.Three quarters of Endgame was a nostalgic run through the previous movies. It was entertaining, but eventually I found it a little boring in all honesty. The end battle was predictably exciting but it didn't redeem itself enough for one major flaw...Where was the Hulk? Aside from a small cameo at the beginning of Infinity War, the character has virtually been written out of the final two movies. Endgame portrays him as almost a new character, with little involvement in any battle scenes. For a character that required such a huge degree of redemption from the prior film, he was almost a secondary thought in this one.I've watched and rewatched countless times to see if I missed something, but I don't think I have. This was a good movie, it just wasn't as good as it could have been.",positive
"Avengers Endgame is a competent movie, which felt like the closing of a circle. It starts with the loss and how it's dealt with, and continues as a journey to past Marvel movies. It's fun as that, giving a nice glimpse to what happened after the end of the first Avengers movie, letting Thor meet his mother and Iron Man his father, and so on, all with the typical Marvel sense of homour. My son of course liked that Thor and his pals were playing Fortnite.It doesn't have the desperation of Infinity War, which made it so strong for me, or even many other superhero movies where there's an enemy to be defeated. At this level, I feel that it's weaker than many previous movies. A lot of the movie shows off alternate versions of past movies or extensions of them, which, while somewhat boring plot-wise, is a treat for fans. I did enjoy all of it, but still, at this level the movie felt more like a homage to previous movies and a way to provide closure than a movie of it own.I won't go into too much further detail, but I'll discuss one small part that felt off to me, because I felt it weakened the ending, and that was Captain Marvel. Even at the end of her own movie (which was pretty good), it was clear to me that she became so overpowered that'd she'd be hard to write into anything. Endgame proved it. She was kept out of the game for most of the movie (obviously because she's overpowered), then arrived at the end flying unharmed through a barrage of missiles and plowing through a spaceship. Then she took the Infinity Gauntlet from Spiderman.And then things went south. Spiderman asked her how she'd get through the battlefield and then all the female heroes stopped the battle to pose and say they'd help her. Come on, this woman just flew through a starship like it wasn't there. She could probably destroy Thanos' entire army in a matter of minutes. And she needs help? And she loses to Thanos in a few seconds only to give Iron Man his chance to die? I think the writers would have done better to simply keep her out. A Deus Ex Machina is a bad plot device. One which fails for 'reasons' is even worse.",positive
"Endgame is far from perfect, and it takes a long time to properly get going, but once it realises exactly what it wants to be, it's the perfect climax to a decade of build-up and packs a surprisingly emotional punch.However, fortnite is in this movie, so I'm giving it a 0/10",positive

"After watching this movie I had to wait a few hours before writing this review because of how drained I felt after. So many characters and so many moving pieces unite for a visually stunning finished product that wraps up decades of works from thousands of people.Honestly, it was all a lot to take in. The many twists and turns and careful attention given to each character made me think this would be much more manageable as a mini series or even a full season of a TV show. Since that is not commercially viable, we have an elongated character-driven action film that tries to focus on over 20 characters and their emotions and motivations.Since we have been introduced to these characters before, we feel invested in their journeys throughout this film. These leads to a speedy 3 hour emotional roller coaster ride as we are quickly taken through the many actions of reactions in so many characters in such a tight time frame.While the planning and execution of this was done well, I couldn't help but feel that there were many distractions that disconnected me from the story and reminded me I was watching a movie. Matthew Berry from ESPN on a speaking role? Why? Joe Russo as an emotional man in a strange therapy group talking about crying during his date? Why? Referencing films during the movie that some of the actors in the movie actually started in... All of these serve to distract from the final product and the central themes and developments of the plot for very little payoff.However, overall this was a well made movie. Great visual effects, a great cast, a well-written story, and good management of all of the central characters. Yet, there were those glimmers throughout the movie that kept poking you to remind you that you were watching a Marvel movie. This, at times, felt like too much. This was a great end to a long and well thought out project. Yet, somehow I don't believe for a second this will actually be the end. It seems like this movies will keep coming out until audiences have had enough, which won't be anytime soon.",positive
"I had high hopes for this movie and for the most part it delivered. There are minor issues that I will share later but I want to begin with the positives first. This movie pays tribute to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a unique way by going back in time to different periods that took place in the MCU. All of the actors are great in their roles and deliver awesome performances. The music by Alan Silvestri is top notch and iconic especially the score Portals when every returns and unites for a showdown with Thanos. This movie made me sob when Iron Man gives his life to save the universe. Such a powerful and emotional moment. The action scenes are great and well-choreographed. The special effects are amazing and well-done. However, there are some things that I have issues with. First, I do not like how the movie handled Hulk. It was interesting to make Bruce Banner and Hulk merge together but they only used him as a joke and didn't really take it anywhere. Also, I wish they didn't try so hard to make Fat Thor so funny. This is a man who just lost and has gone through so much and all they can do is make a joke out of him? Other than that I loved this movie and I believe that it deserves the praise that it has garnered.",positive

I didn't have all of the earmarks of being after her before in her own film in any case in Endgame they exhibited however stunning, alternatively sturdy and thusly the way wherein sound she absolutely is. also, at the modern-day I as an other love her! Be that appreciation to the very assurance it could, marvel want to use be aware as for her line simultaneously, I did not appear to shape a hint of her line like ""i am the essential grounded"" and ""You didn't win in lightweight of the very reality that before you doubtlessly did not have me"" duh. In like way not getting the chance to ignore Hawkeye. cutting instantly to the chase, in Avengers I clearly didn't seem after Hawkeye thinking about the manner that he is definitely a 'person' with a shock and definitely thoughtlessly showed up in any scene anyways he is persona is thusly BADASS! everything that we might like, what we might like is right here.moreover I do not bounce on why various people cannot famous that Thor is fats or effect him kind of a shaggy dog story. it is to nation , this film need to similarly be making an undertaking to modern North American domain a message as for at any charge what 'shape' square measure you, you will be proficient to be a blessed person and further the earth . To get without delay to the point, I want what they did to Thor, that guy is demoralized and taking the vital capable while he colossal the shot to execute Thanos in time battle. however the very fact that he currently did butchered him before long it is now not getting the chance to bypass on reestablished his family members of thoughts blowing spot. except he is God of Thunder for the prosperity of goodness, he may hit his stomach with thunder and were given his abs returned.i'm in this manner jaunty too for Captain the usa.

This film wont to be totally energized and remotely remarkable. in the end i am getting it why the Russo Brothers entreated North American domain to try and a surprise moving photo long partition race earlier than remark Endgame pondering that this movie had the complete thing to understand what surrendered before the whole package of this.Orchestrated or no longer, no take a look at quantity it takes.cross watch it for yourself.",positive
"I laughed and cried throughout, and loved every moment of this epic conclusion. All of the subtle call backs to past movies made it all the more entertaining. I've heard lots of complaints about logical flaws etc, but I really think it answers as many questions as it possibly could (and tbh any more realism would be misplaced in the MCU). Was a truly memorable experience seeing all the storylines culminate in this film, and watching it in a full audience where people gasped and clapped and cheered together was the perfect ending to this whole phase.",positive
"All in all it's a fine movie. Naturally if you haven't seen the previous few Avengers there's no reason for you to watch this, but as far as critiquing movies this movie has few flaws. It's a good movie with no controversial topics that all members of the family would enjoy. The main point against this movie is the ridiculous run-time of 3 hours.",positive
"SPOILERS AHEAD...With ten years of an era drawing to a close, I had no idea what to expect. Sure I guessed Cap or Tony would stack it when we all started speculating after the end of Infinity War. Then trailer by trailer we all started guessing how it was going to play out.I called that Cap would go back in time and remain. I was unsure that Stark would make the ultimate sacrifice. However not one person on the outside could have called 'Fat Thor'. What started out as comedy gold, quickly became annoying and insulting to a character of the caliber. It almost ruined the film if I'm being honest.The whole setting of the film, the time travel, the 'quick win' at the beginning - it all felt right and in place. I didn't think it went OTT on previous nostalgia and 3hrs 2 mins sailed by. Thankfully there is little inclusion of Captain Marvel as a) the solo film and what they have done with the character is by far the weakest in the MCU and b) shoe horning her in as a major player would have been an insult to the rest of the crew.It's sad to see it all come to an end truth be told. But it has been one hell of a ride and I now look forward to see what Marvel Studios can do with the X-Men.",positive
"A thousand things unexplained just get all heroes from previous movies and put them all in a big heroic legendary fight, they won't even wonder how the hell they got back they just know they are there to fight like it was all planned out.
I honestly expected much more but since Marvel had to put an ending to this extravaganza they had to end the storyline abruptly it's like making a masterpiece of painting throughout the years and in the end grabbing a knife to stab the whole piece with holes and leaving everything to the viewer's imagination.",positive
Seriously not getting what people like in this movie giving 10/10. This movie is horrible and very boring. Not expecting this from Marvel. It seems Marvel tried to make a cocktail of all hit formula in one movie to satisfy all type of audience. The end result - disaster. Worst movie of marvel ever made.,negative
Best Movies of MCU universe. Amazing Fantastic owsam climax. Good and best story. This movie is no.1 movie of MCU universe of all time. I was see this movie in theatre. This moment one of the best moment of my life.Hindi language = Yeh movie itni acchi hai ki batane ke liye shabd nahi hai.,positive
It was an emotional rollercoaster to say the least if you are coming into marvel for the first it may not impact you the way it impacted me and you may not understand much but if you love marvel and invested in marvel i highly recommend seeing endgame.,positive
"It's hard to believe that after 22 movies and 11 years that Endgame wraps up what is now known as ""the Infinity Saga"". Marvel does not disappoint with Endgame.While it does start out pretty slow, it all builds to the climatic final battle between the heroes and Thanos. The battle is reminiscent of those in the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit trilogies: massive scale, good vs evil, whatever it takes.It's not what we necessarily expected, but it's what we deserved. It perfectly wraps it up.",positive
"Not as good as infinity war..
But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.",positive
The epic conclusion of Marve's MCU franchise helds with Avengers Endgame which deeply fullfills every desire a marvel fan will want. No.1 in the world,positive
"Great movie. Heroes are perfect, high-level acting. In general, the film deserves 10 stars, but DC has, as always, included a scene of capturing a hero who is not killed. It's a weird decision to make if you know it's found in other movies in this movie universe.",positive
"First of all, what's up with all the 10/10 ratings ? Just ridiculous. No one in their right mind would give this movie a perfect score. Probably the majority of the 10/10 are bought.
I'm a big fan of the Marvel franchice, but this just isn't a great movie and is definitely not a worthy follow up on Inifinity War. What really bothered me: What the hell was up with Thor ? The once so mighty god was just a cringy, whiney fat guy - what a let down. I also disliked the new smart/soft hulk.. but may that's just personal preference.
And there was that scene in the final fight.where all the female super hereos had the time to gather for an epic attack.. oh vey. The whole scene just felt trashy and uncalled for.Overall it was an entertaining movie which had it's moments, but imho couldn't live up to the hype.",positive
"It was nothing short of a masterpiece! Sooooo worth it and this review is weeks after I've seen it, still feeling the emotions.
Must Watch!",positive
"I should start off by saying that I am someone who has grown a little tired of the MCU. All the films have begun to feel very formulaic and you know exactly what's going to happen even if you haven't read the comics. The cringey humor is also a huge turn-off for me. After Infinity War I took a little break.With all of that being said I was really hoping Engame was going to change my mind on the MCU. I was hoping for something spectacular that would make me say ""I guess this is why the MCU has such loyal fans."" But sadly it didnt. Not even close. I feel sorry for huge MCU fans that this film was their sendoff to 10ish years of Marvel. Because what an unfortunate send off it was.1. This film did not need to be 3 hours long. There were so many times where I felt myself feeling bored and checking the time. There where many moments where it just seemed to drag on way too long. A mot of these scenes good have been condensed.2. The writing reminded me of bad Fanfiction. It was lifeless and flat. The dialogue between characters sounded so forced and fake. At first I thought everyone was doing a poor acting job but I really think it was the script that was causing this.3. The cringey kids humor was way too much. The tone of the film was either Disney Channel Original Movie or serious war drama. There was no balance the two tones did not mix well at all. Hulk dabbing...seriously? And I dont even want to go into full detail of how awful Thor was. It was very unfortunate that thats how they chose to have the character. Him getting fat ans playing Fortnite? Tacky.4. The final battle wasn't even that exciting. The CGI didn't look good and there were no moments where I was like ""WOW that was amazing!"" It was all stuff we had seen in the films before. Nothing new.I did enjoy Clint Barton's storyline throughout the film. I really enjoyed the two Nebula's and that bit. Tony's funeral and Steve's happy ending were both emotional. But that's really the only few things I enjoyed. Even Stan Lee's cameo was a let down.
People were freaking out about spoilers but there really isn't anything to spoil. It ends exactly how everyone expects it to. The only sort of shocking moment is Black Widow's death but even then it wasnt super shocking. A friend compared the film to that of an under seasoned chicken and I would have to agree.",positive
"Good job for the special effects. I know they worked a lot on this. BUT is so stupid that every character is so serious, but you can't take them serious, and it gets realy lame.I lasted like 15 minutes. I couldn't.The only super hero movie that is good i think is deadpool, he's funny at least. You can't make a superhero movie with ""serious"" characters, bc it will turn out really bad.",negative
"If you adore science fiction and followed Marvel AND DC, despite their differences, and Despite the bad 1 star reviews (haters gonna hate!) I assure you that YOU will LOVE this movie because of all what it expresses, from Science fiction, Emotions, Sounds, Twists, Story line, and I mean everything about this movie is incredible... Just watch it and don't listen to anyone, I guarantee you will be Surprised, Laugh, Cry, and have a beautiful and unforgettable Core memory for an amazing movie.",positive
"Not perfect, but still one of the best action films I've ever seen (alongside Infinity Wars) and the only film I've watched twice at the cinema. In a word, epic.",positive
This was one of the greatest movie experiences of all time for me.,positive
One of the greatest movies IMO and the best MCU movie by far. Best part of the movie is Portals it's a MASTERPIECE! I've watched the movie for the first time 2 days ago and i'm still thinking about it. I don't think any future MCU movie will top this. Let's just hope!,positive
"WOW!!! where do I start first of all this film spectacular and the visuals are great the acting is fantastic this film made me cry laugh and I had chills and the end was absolutely mind blowing it was genius what marvel did I love how they all went back in time to different times and movies and then thanos found out there plan and they had to fight him and it was epic how cap finally lifted Thor's hammer , that scene where iron man snaps his fingers and brings everybody back best Scene not in just a mcu but this is one of the best battle scenes of all time how they ended perfect I had no problems with this movie it's soo good definitely a must see and should be seen by everyone fantastic.",positive
This was a very well written movie. I had my own theory on what I thought was going to happen but was proven wrong. It's definitely an emotional rollercoaster. Enjoy!,positive
"Was a good movie but it just needed a bit more to it, it wasn't as good as they said it would be and not much really happened.",positive
"One of the best CG effects at this time. At the same time, the plots are A bit Illogical. The endings of the main characters are pretty farfetched. Thor with the new hammer could crash Thanos in the last film, now suddenly, nobody can fight against Thanos without a single infinite stone.",positive
First half is boring AF and movie is so overhyped.,positive
It was everything for me. The way they linked all the ends was marvelous. I found all the happiness and sadness at the same time. Love you Iron man 3000. And now we all do know who's Captain. And sadest thing was to lose widow. And I still love Red witch She was incredible. At the end Thank You Marvel.,negative
"Wow. What a film. What can I say? And epic conclusion to the Infinity storyline.The story was epic, the acting epic and the fight scenes....epic. If you're like me you've grown loving these characters and the storylines they take and after Infinity War you want justice.This film delivers and more. Thanos, best villain to date and the trio of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor are insane.",positive

"I had higher expectations for the Endgames action, if you compare it with Infinity War, but plot did focus more on the characters. Lots of funny scenes in the movie as always. Only concern i left the cinema with a few questions, sure they will be answered soon after most have watched it. It's a 3 hours movie that doesn't make you feel like watching 3 hours, even if it would go 3,5 hours or more you would still sitting and watch it and time would flow away. But the feeling you get in the end is that an Era came to it's end.",positive
"Part 2 following on from Part 1 Infinity Wars - how can the universe be saved? This keeps you going to see how it will end. However, it is over long. Again it has suffered from having too many characters in it. Some just did not have to be in the movie at all.I still enjoyed the movie, good special effects, some character development that raises an eyebrow or two. Good evil guy (I must have been tired because by the end of it I thought he was starting to make a lot of sense).A lot of people have said it's boring, but I wasn't particularly bored. I liked the focus on Jeremy Renner's character and plight, in fact they could have focused more on his character (particularily on earth and his own clean up operation - which would have created more interesting questions versus Thanos' agenda), cut three or four other characters completely (Thor for example), cut the ""silly comedy"" elements by 2/3rds and you'd have had a darker movie I would have loved.By the end, you are just glad you've gotten to the end credits. I doubt it will be worth a second viewing.",positive

"Avengers: Endgame is an epic movie! The culmination of over a decade of storytelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, this epic superhero film brings together almost every major character from the MCU to battle against the ultimate threat: Thanos.The film opens with a somber tone, as we see the aftermath of Thanos' snap from the previous film, Avengers: Infinity War. The world is in chaos, with half of all living creatures disintegrated into dust. The remaining Avengers are left to pick up the pieces and find a way to reverse what Thanos has done.The first act of the film is slow-paced and emotional, as the characters deal with the trauma and grief caused by the snap. The Russo brothers do an excellent job of giving each character their own moment to shine, as they come to terms with the enormity of the situation. The film takes its time to explore the personal relationships between the characters, which adds an emotional weight to the story.As the plot moves forward, the remaining Avengers come up with a plan to travel back in time and retrieve the Infinity Stones before Thanos can use them to wipe out half of all life. This leads to a series of exciting and action-packed sequences, as the characters revisit key moments from the previous films in the MCU. These scenes are a real treat for fans, as they are full of Easter eggs and nods to the previous films.The final act of the film is where the Russo brothers really pull out all the stops. The battle against Thanos and his army is epic in scale, with every character getting their own moment to shine. The action is well-choreographed and thrilling, with some truly jaw-dropping moments. The film's climax is emotionally satisfying, as the Avengers come together to save the world.One of the standout performances in the film comes from Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark/Iron Man. Downey Jr. Has been the heart of the MCU since the first Iron Man film in 2008, and his performance in Endgame is one of his best. He brings a depth and complexity to the character that we haven't seen before, as Tony deals with the consequences of his actions and makes the ultimate sacrifice to save the world.Another standout performance comes from Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans has always been a strong presence in the MCU, but in Endgame, he really shines. He brings a sense of nobility and determination to the character, as Steve fights to save the world and make things right.The film's visual effects are also impressive, with some of the best CGI seen in a superhero film. The battle scenes are visually stunning, with the use of color and lighting creating a real sense of spectacle. The film's score, composed by Alan Silvestri, is also excellent, adding to the emotional weight of the story.If there is one criticism to be made of the film, it's that some of the character arcs feel rushed or incomplete. With so many characters to juggle, it's inevitable that some of them will be given short shrift. However, the Russo brothers do a commendable job of balancing the different storylines and giving each character their moment to shine.In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is a fitting conclusion to the first decade of the MCU. It's a thrilling and emotional ride that brings together almost every major character from the franchise in a satisfying way. The Russo brothers have crafted a film that not only delivers on the action and spectacle that fans expect from a superhero movie but also has real heart and emotion. It's a must-see for anyone who has been following the MCU for the past decade.",positive

"... and Marvel isn't her favourite.Neither is it mine, in fact the more and more the marvel universe has expanded the more I have gotten disenchanted with it. Although I loved most of phase one and a lot of phase two, passed that I felt like it had gotten too much for me and the storylines have gotten more and more absurd, to the point where even my enjoyment of Infinity War was limited. Endgame though seems to be an anomaly.The absurd storyline is still there, though the way it's carried out does make it fairly enjoyable, the plot holes are still there also and the four million backstories anyone but the most avid marvel fans would forget in an instant consistently make an appearance too, but all of this seems less important than previously.Instead this fourth instalment keeps you gripped, and is perfectly paced, impressive considering it's length. For the entire three hours I was glued to the screen and the feeling that something big was in store never left. On top of this the storyline, I mean the bare bones of it, was genuinely really good, I never expected what was coming and felt sucked in to what was trying to be achieved.But this was nothing on the finale, the grandeur of the final battle (this isn't a spoiler, everyone knows there's going to be a battle of sorts at the end) is something which only the greatest action/fantasy films have mustered. Plus the emotional ending was exactly that, genuinely emotional, I don't think anyone didn't feel a tug on the old heartstrings.All in all, considering the twenty two films and the effort/hype put into it, surprisingly Endgame actually delivered, and the sense of expectancy you felt because of this being a conclusion of sorts, again surprisingly was actually delivered upon! Well done marvel!But far to say it's one of the best films of all time though...",positive

Acting was good, comedy was solid, a little too child friendly banter but oh well.. overall 7/10!",positive
"Thank you, Marvel and the Russo brothers. Maybe a little bit more credit to the other character who die. A proper burial or remembrance of some sort would have been nice. Really sorry she couldn't make it in the final battle. But what should be, will be. It was a very well paced movie, there was a slow period but overall, very nicely done. I wonder how many people wrote the screenplays.",positive
I will give it 6/10 for the cast that was incredible. Tha story was in general boringgggg and too long. I love long movies but this was an neverending marvel trash. Btw I don't like Marvel at all. I feel it is just too overrated. I mean there are a lot of great great movies out there better than this one and they are ranked below it. It doesn't deserve to be in top250,positive
It was pk but much much to long. Infinity Wars was alot better. Iron man dying was a but to dramatic. I should have waited to come out on Firestick but since I just spent $5 and change was t that great a loss just my time. You have been warned.,negative

"So here it goes, you can judge me by my rating and think why I have cut the 2 marks because (Iron Man and Black Widow) seriously, why did you do that.
Seriously, Russo Brothers and their team gave this world wide movie industry a real and original cinematic experience.All 22 movies end is there.",positive
Easily the best marvel film to exist. You'll most likely cry in the cinema,positive
I luv Thor 😍😘😘😘2baar theater mn dekha..... It's totally mind-blowing,positive
"Amazing performance by all characters....but Grand salute to Tony Stark, Thor, Natasha, Hulk, Captain America. Special Power who have is Captain Marvel. When she comes in the frame, me & all fans cheering to her...& We said "" Ab Thanos, Tera kya hoga...?""",positive
That fat Thor is amazing. But I think Captain America can lift the Hammer becouse Thor oermited that.,positive
"The movie was engaging, all fight scenes and story line were exciting I enjoyed it so much.
Spoiler below:
I didn't like the dramatic addition to the storyline, after all it's still a superhero movie I wouldn't want any of the superheroes to die.",positive
"Best of best super hero movie ever seen . especially the way of story telling connect all the old marvel movies. emotional , laugh & action .... Cap , Iron man & Natasha are best",positive
"OK, so I succumbed under extreme pressure to give this woke pile of poo a second go. After the immense event that was Infinity War, I was really let down by this Russo effort on the first watch. This second watch I did on my own, in the comfort of my own home and we'll... it was OK. Fat Thor, ""girls get it done"", the Black Widow sacrifice thing... really we're woeful and needed rewitnessing just to confirm how terrible they were. But I really got emotional at the end and felt some loss... and that was a good thing. I can let it go now and move on. Phew!",positive
The drama was not in the form required and the comedy is not funny and some of the footage is meaningless,negative
Really good endgame movie of marvel but it's not their best.,positive
"Avengers Endgame - Bit of action, fun, emotion, sentiment, goosebump moments. Good movie. I dunno if am very satisfied or not, have to watch later again.I watched it in 4DX. Good experience but whopping 28$/ticket. I believe that's future of theaters as home theater has become more affordable nowadays.Dialog I liked the most by my Favorite Thanos - I will create a universe where one remembers what's lost but knows only what's given.But only unexpected scenes in the movie. That's a huge deal. Never knew what's coming next...",positive
"It is the best Foursquare in history, the film starring a large group of stars, and the film was able to recruit actors in a wonderful way. The film has a quantity of action, drama and comedy, all were more than wonderful. Each term is meaningless and deserves an evaluation of 10/10",positive
Many of the 1/10 reviews or people that say infinity war is better is the people who don't understand most of what is happening or haven't seen all of the marvel films or have not read any marvel comics. Endgame is a true treat for hardcore fans such as I am as I have seen every marvel movie and have read many of the comics. It is full of satisfying scenes that have references to other marvel movies so the people that say endgame is a waste of time don't understand the references to older movies. Endgame is one of those movies where you really have to watch previous movies to find it fun. If you have not seen all or most of the marvel movies or have not read any comics you will feel bored and confused of the plot as most of the movie is fan service to marvel fans which is a 3 hour special with all characters from every marvel movie which will satisfy true marvel fans.,positive
"Years of sorry telling coming together at a close. The effects, cinematography, acting, all very good and fully satisfying. Not a cash grab like lots of people are saying. After watching a few times, the plots holes are null. You just have to pay attention. Plus, Cap finally gets his dance after the heart wrenching scene in the first CA, where Peggy loses contact. Iron Man sacrificing himself is the ultimate and brave conclusion to his entire story and character, the ultimate growth of a character. Sadly, this movie can't convey the story without a lot of analyzing and supporting stories from other films. Otherwise, you'll see all these plot holes. Watch it and the other MCU films. Phenomenal storyline, possibly of our time.",positive
"What a send-off for three important Avengers, completing their story arch in the most spectacular way.I laughed.
I cried even more.
I was in awe of the action sequences (Cap Vs. Cap anyone?!?)Just perfect in every way. I can't wait to see it again and again and again.",positive
"Not a bad movie Could be better.
Graphics were great 👏
The thor character was not good at the story
We were more excited than the story
This movie has put a lot of questions?!
In the end, thank you to the friends who make the movies relevant to the viewer.💙",positive
"I have to say that I am a big fan of the Marvel Universe created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby since the 70s. I remained a comic fan all my life (with a clear preference of franko-belgium comics) but, as a grown up finally, I still love everything from Mark Millar, too (The Avengers, The Authority, Spiderman etc.). I guess I have seen most of the Marvel movies, necessary in order to follow the storyline of Endgame. It was amazing to see that the authors had planned most of the events already a long time ago (watch Iron Man 1, if you do not believe it). To me and our boys therefore, this was not just a movie, it was a proper event over 3 hours. I was laughing about Bruce Banner making his personal peace with the Hulk character and Thor transforming into the dude. I was crying for Natascha and Tony (nobody saw it) and I was on the edge of my seat in the end. After a while I had realized, that the whole time in the cinema, I felt like I used to as a child when I was in a dream. That was a bit odd but that's what it was. While we were all blown away by the power of the movie, now, some hours later, our house is grieving. It feels like we lost a family member today with Tony Stark. All I want right now, is to watch the first Iron Man for the 5th time and then work my way through the Marvel Universe again. You guys from Marvel, Stan Lee up there in heaven, I salute you!",positive
"I donnt like the ending part....... it
is so confused",positive
"The drama was not as it should be, the Comedy is not so funny and infinity war mavie was best events were excellent than endgame and there was not harmony in the movie",negative
A worthy conclusion to 11 years of movies. A definite must see movie.,positive
I have just finished watching Avengers End Game and have literally been blown away at how good it was.It is a very fitting end to 11 years of MCU films and ties up all the loose ends nicely and gives characters the sign off deserved. I honestly cannot remember a 3 hr film passing so quickly. You'll laugh in places and I'm pretty darn sure you'll cry in places as well. I wasn't expecting to but I was gone in the final 15 minutes and I don't think there was a dry eye in the cinema either.So go along sit back and enjoy Avengers End Game.,positive
"I'm speechless. This masterpiece rewards you for your waiting. Absolute perfection. I have nothing to say yet I want to say everything. I cried like a little girl, i laughed, I screamed. This movie makes everything worth fighting even when there's no hope left. Thank you Marvel, thank you.3000/10",positive
"This one is good but some characters are getting way too little attention.
Like the other movies this one is a ""cinema movie"".",positive
"Amazing movie i have ever scene.
marvel make good job.
love marvel & love avengers💝",positive
"This movie is truly magnificent not perfect, but more than enough. It's very complete in a sense that a draws a conclusion to a lot of heroes' stories and truly end it in a satisfying way. But most importantly in this movie the avengers isn't a bunch of superheroes that just happened to face the same threat, they are genuinely the dream team of earth the most elite of earth, all giving their best shot to work together when we needed them to to fight the battles we never could, to protect the universe and most importantly the earth.We'll start with stark, his arc in this movie is beyond comprehension, I would say the best performance of him in any movie I've ever seen. The character development of tony is just awesome, the movie smartly gets him and his dad an interaction that's not force and his expressions and struggles when talking to his dad just shows how much he's missing him how much he's regretted and how thankful he truly is. His snap in the end has technically been what he's always wanted, being a guy who doesn't care about anything to being a guy who's the protector of the earth to being a guy who fails in everything yet trying so hard, getting his will crushed and finally a vulnerable family man in this movie who just wants to live a happy life and not lose what he's left. And finally makes a comeback when the people really needs him, to be iron man once more. It's just awesome to slap people in the face who calls superhero movies superficial and stupid, they made tony stark so relatable to the audience creating resonance after resonance after resonance it's just perfectly done.There too much to talk about so to keep the review short I will just list out things i think was brilliant and things I think was mehBrilliant things:
Nebula and Tony playing games
Cap marvel saving Tony
Tony's slight arguement with cap at the start
Thor went for the head
Professor hulk
Tony getting a family and his fear of losing it
Fat Thor hilarious
Korg and Thor playing fortnite
Loki and his space stone
Tony meeting Howard thank you
Cap meeting Peggy and in the end spent his life with her
Thor meeting his mom again eat some salad
Star lord singing and dancing
Black widow and hawkeye's Fight
Her death redemption
Hulk finger snap
Thanos blows up the entire facility no mercy
Double hammer Thor I mean come on
Big three gathering tgt
Cap picking up Thor's hammer
Portals and people gave me the biggest smile on ma face
Avengers....... assemble
Teamwork
Tony hugging peter for real
Gamora and star lord's reactions seeing each other
Doctor strange's finger
I am inevitable
I am ............. I R O N M A N
Tony dies
His funeral and dialogue
Cap turning old
Falcon is new cap ?
Valkyrie becoming queen of Asgard
Thor joining guardians
I love you three thousandMeh things:
Hawkeyes build up and hype sort of wasted
Cap should be able to pick up the hammer but the thunder should only be coming from Thor not cap
Too much dr hulk ? I do wanna see a bit of hulk
Can't take Thor srsly even in srs moments
Ugh female team moment very very cringe worthy very forced
Lot of people complain about slow pacing but I think it's the right pacing maybe even slight too fast. Slower pacing provides more build up, but most people consider it is a con.",positive
Marvel knows hoe to get the viewers involved into a movie and then how to play eith their emotions!,positive
"What a year to live when End Game hit theaters all over the world. This movie made for fans from fans itself. I love how story develop from 1 point to another point. Not going to talk about plot hole or they could do that instead doing this who the hell care bout that. This movie very entertaining from start to finish. This is 2008 ~ 2019 build into awesomeness. Every bit character in the movie got their moment to shine even for a bit minutes. I love what they have done with the franchise. The RUSSOS You guys are ROCK, I saw what u guys already planned for next movie. Really enjoy for this , Just go watch and enjoy the action, the character and the audience clapping when something AWESOME happen. Happy Marvel days , should get public holiday after this movie. Up to next Spiderman : Far From Home ^^",positive
"Iwill talk about four points completely destroyed the film.
1.Time machine contrasts and exaggerations
2. Suddenly the captain of America became old
3. Kill and show the most important characters inappropriately as if they do not have an audience.
4.The last war in the film was an endless mess",positive
"I understand that people really likes the movie, but in no world this movies is better or as great as the godfather, the dark night or pulp fiction. You all are overrating this movie",negative
This movie is simply art. The whole movie let you on the edge of you seat and it doesn't feel like 3hours at all.,positive
"When you see a ""10"" for this movie, you know there's a lot of blind love there. On the other hand, a ""1"" is blind hate.A ""10"" would mean the movie is perfect, which is not - those guys should see a movie without emotion.A ""1"" means the movie lacks even the very basic production, which it does not - those guys should check on IMDb the lowest rated movies ever - and watch them - to know what a really bad movie really means.The movie fits the bill for the ones expecting the expectable - my case, by the way. I have seen really bad movies, and this is not the case. I've also seen very good movies, and this got close, but not that much.",positive
"Not as satisfying that i was hoping. It was mainly good, but comedy din't work at all and fatshaming Thor for laughts was just lame. Infinity War better, but at least ending was not messed up GoT style. Captain Marvel was lame and less of her would have been better.
After this i don't think Marvel has anything interesting to offer anymore outside home coming and guardians 3.",positive
"There are two types of people who have written reviews. People who truly do not appreciate the franchise and then the ones that do! This was a perfect ending. I cried, I laughed but mostly the movie did not leave me feeling disappointed!",positive
"This movie is a hectic and at sometimes confusing wrap up to 11 years of the Avengers. It's hard to see some of the characters that you love and have enjoyed for a decade leave the MCU. And perhaps watch the MCU end, with the PC comments coming out of marvel studios. It is heavily foreshadowed in the movie and honestly I have no interest in what's coming. However, me and my family thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Although it is not as good as Infinity War. Infinity war set the bar with story, pacing, action, and a cliffhanger that made you want to see endgame so bad that some people even went out to see that very average Captain Marvel movie. The best part about it was that they didn't let Captain Marvel ruin the movie. They let some things into this movie that 10 years ago they would never have. However, since it's the end I won't gripe about that. Good movie, it doesn't need any recommendations because everybody's going to see it. I enjoyed it.",positive
"No words to describe, outstanding and simply brilliant",positive
"While superhero movies aren't all known for deep plots or very substantial storytelling, Endgame falls far off the Avenger's franchise and feels way too long and underwhelming. The tone of the movie is stripped down by the long shots and unnecessary plot devices, which are predictable and is a forced way to make spectators feel like it's a satisfying ending, which it definitely isn't. While some characters do get a somehwat satisfying closing, the story feels dull and without the excitement that prompted the other movies until now, every scene is stretched for far longer than it should, the editing isn't condensanding, and while one of the biggest points in Infinity war was the various events happening at the same time, this movie does exactly the opposite, it feels, overall, disappointing. It's not a horrible movie, but not even close to one of Marvel's bests and that's what's most disappointing about it, because it feels like an ending, but not like a closure.",positive
"The entire cinema, even the annoying little kids that clearly should not have been there on the first day lol- gasped, laughed, cried throughout the entire film. It was insane, it was emotional, it was gripping, it was sentimental, it was EPIC and it was PERFECT. I am so completely and utterly satisfied.I have just no words for Endgame, I watched it 12 hours ago and am still processing that sheer brilliance. I have already planned my Round 2 watch! It deserves more than 10 stars, Russo Brothers' did an amazing job at balancing this movie with just about everything that it needed and left nothing to imagination.I am a huge bollywood stan and am used to 3 hour feature-length films, but Endgame had me looking at my phone in what felt like only an hour...but in fact 2.5 hours had already passed!!!",positive
"This movie had enormous shoes to fill, and does a pretty good job considering it has to address and tie up loose ends from over 10 years of movies.A common thing I see in negative reviews is Captain America using Mjolnir, I knew this would eventually happen because let's not forget he almost picked it up in Age if Ultron. The whole lightning thing, while Thor has that power all by himself, Odin specifically says it was meant to ""focus his power"". I think of mjolnir like training wheels, Thor needed it to learn his true powers, but in Captain America's case, it's like adding training wheels to a bike. It doesn't make it not a bike. (I know that was kinda confusing). My real and really only problem is Thanos using Stormbreaker and Mjolnir. How does someone so evil wield a weapon that LITERALLY chooses if you're worthy. Captain America deserved such a weapon, but I'm still stumped how Thanos does.I also want to address Thor. I am reading so many reviews about how they ruined him, but THINK ABOUT IT, THOR IS RUINED! He had one shot to stop Thanos, and missed it. He literally has the weight of half the universe on his shoulders. After killing Thanos out of spite, he realized he is truly powerless to bring anyone back. You mean to tell me that if you were responsible for FAILING to kill the man who wiped out half the universe, along with losing your brother, mother, father, best friend, hair, eye, hammer, and home, you wouldn't fell like just giving up? THINK, PEOPLE! He literally said ""What Nore could I lose"". He's pretty much giving in to what he said in infinity war.I think Banner/Hulk was executed pretty well. He said in Ragnarok that if he became hulk again, he might not ever come back, so naturally he is stuck in between. This is his change into the smart scientist hulk from the comics, and I'm eager to see what they do with this reformed character.I understand that there is A LOT going on in the movie, and there are imperfections, BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMEONE TRY TO DO BETTER!!! This is over 10 YEARS we're talking about. No one person, (or two) should ever have perfection expected of them when they are responsible for capping a 22 movie franchise.Overall, I definitely recommend seeing. For a 3 hour movie,I was never bored, and it ended about as well as you could want.",positive
"To be fair, it would be tough to top Infinity War, but was this seriously the best script they could come up with? The time travel trope was played out two decades ago, so why rehash it again? No idea, but the studio reheated some ""Back to the Future"" left-overs and went for the lowest hanging fruit on the tree.Okay, so now Stark and cohorts are going to fix is all by going back in time and ""pre-stealing"" the infinity stones then politely returning them the instant they were stolen to begin with presumably to ""not effect"" the timeline. Except, they already affected it when Loki ran off with the Tesseract when they bungled the first attempt. So what came of that? A giant, gaping plot hole is what.The whole sequence exists simply to remind the audience that Captain America still hasn't gotten over his first love, who by the way is about 60 years old at the time they visit, but she looks just the same. And flat attempt to make the audience feel empathy for Stark as he engages with his father commiserating on parenthood which is conveniently placed before he dies.Finally, the culmination of the Avenger's time travelling hi-jinks come to fruition when one of the smartest guys around, Banner-Hulk, puts it on and makes a wish. What does he wish for? To undo Thanos' eradication of 50% of the life in the universe. Makes sense right? But he's supposed to be a genius. Wouldn't a better wish be: Thanos was never born? Way more lives saved that way. But why didn't he? Plot There was a need to send Tony off with a heroes death which fell flat.So, to save Hawkeye, Future Nebula kills her past self with no apparent effect. If you died in the past wouldn't you cease to be in the future? Simple logic. Never mind, this movie jumped the logic rails shortly after title splash rolled.Ultimately, the movie plays like a Michael Bay boom fest and that's all it really has going for it. The script is cringe worthy and written with one goal in mind: To give the actors whose contracts were up, a way out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Technically the movie is superior, but the writing is rubbish.",negative
"I loved it and i hated how full of flaws it was .. the story is epic the fighting scenes sucks , the Thor power is not how it used to be in the first movie the captain marvel power is overrated . they gave too much power to iron man and captain america the truth is the cannot withstand .. i think these flaws made me question the movie a little",positive
"One of my favorite movie series. Felt sad, cried but still had fun. sad this series has reach its end but all series entertained me and my nieces and nephews had theie own hrroes through them. Love this movie and forever a fan! Love you Scarlet johansson",positive
"Best MCU Film Ever Made Because of Tony Stark, what he did in the film, he was very sad as a fan, I am cried a lot, because of the iron man, the film was Blockbuster. RIP MY HERO IRON MAN (TONY STARK) 😢",positive
"Heist movie, time travel movie, epic battle movie and, for a while, even it looked like a depressing french art movie. But in the end it all makes sense and ties all together, while the original Avengers pass the torch to the next generation (and then... it is a funeral movie, like ""The Big Chill"").",positive
"The build up, the Easter eggs, the story line across all 21 previous marvel movies have led to this moment and oh boy do they execute well. If you're a casual watcher you might not get why everyone loves this movie so much, which is unfortunate because you should really watch every movie in order before this to appreciate the entire story.Probably the funniest marvel movie too (sorry guardians/ragnarok) but this movie made me laugh, cry, and had me on the edge of my seat. Thank you Russo brothers, thank you Kevin Feige, thank you to all the cast and crew I LOVE YOU 3000",positive
If this was the last mcu movie I would be perfect happy with it,positive
"I thought the conclusion to the story was well written and rounded out a great saga.The action scene at the end was exactly what I was hoping it would be, because my connection to Marvel has been with my toys as a kid, where everyone fights everyone. And it totally satisfied that above and beyond. But I found that where they messed up majorly, was with the individual characters.
WHAT I MEAN:1. Thor. My LORD was this a WASTE. It was hilarious that he was fat, and bulging, and looked like 'a melted ice cream' for about 10-15 minutes. Then it got very old and we realized that this whole movie, was pretending to be a last 'Hoorah' of The orginal main 4 Avengers....hear me out2. And then there is the Hulk. Marvel doesn't ever know what to do with Hulk.
Incredible Hulk, is too much Hulk with poor plot development, Avengers waits till the movie is half over to show him. Then he never gets a standalone film again, and now in this , he is nonexistent during the entire 3 hour movie wearing a pair of glasses and a sling.The big Issue: Instead of Iron Man, Cap, Thor and Hulk defeating the main super villain for the last time as a team, we get Iron Man, by HIMSELF snapping away all the troubles of the universe, along side Thor-ish, Captain America, and Pepper Potts. The EndGrade:
Action: A-
Plot: A
Fun?: Yes
Character Arc: B-
Acting: Aside from RDJ, Evans, and a few others, pretty dry.Out of respect its an 8/10, will be less interested in the rest of the MCU going forward.",positive
"I enjoyed the movie but it wasn't a patch on IW. Too many leaps to be made and lacking on detail! I thought I must have fallen asleep at the climax when Iron Man switches the stones like a street magician! Also trying to tie up all the out of contract actors was a bit weak. Captain America successfully changing time and history is an obvious flaw given all we are told in the movie about time travel however I was glad to see it come to an end as a happy ever after for my 15 year old daughter! Personally, I would have liked some shock and awe instead of the Hollywood ending which I felt we got from IW. But what do I know? It's enjoyable but in reality how was it ever going to live up to IW? That movie had set the bar! Some of the CGI and superimposed stuff in this movie also felt cheap! Still enjoyed it but maybe I was expecting too much.",positive
The comedy is lacking and although the cinematography is good the plot is lacking in places 7/10,positive
"Please don't explain rules to a concept and then break them in the same movie. We are watching, we aren't stupid.",negative
"Unbelievably fabulous . For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. What a visual treat. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it to experience the visual treat!",positive
"Seriously this is one hit kill for the closing of the series. You got it all in one, the action, the feeling. This movie melt my heart...",positive
"Epic Finale!If you just wait for the action scenes, better you watch The Raid, IP-Man or even UFC & WWE Smack Down. HAIL MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE!",positive
"Okay, I guess I have to say something now. Avengers Endgame! First of all, thank you so much to the whole team for everything!I saw Avengers Endgame twice this week. And there is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie.While I was watching Avengers Endgame, the crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to applaud at the end of the movie. And so did I. I cried 5 times during the movie. Not just me, everyone was crying in the theater. So I'm fully on my emotion, there was so many tears of joy and lost. I know it's a superhero movie but it left me speechless.3 hours well used. It was a perfect ending of the Avenger Movies. So, I can't dispute its great conclusion. It's definitely one of the best Marvel films.OMG! I laughed, cried and was speechless.
I'm gonna miss this team. I love you 3000.",positive
"Listen I was hoping for a world breaker hulk redemption but there was crickets. I have NO idea why they give one of the most popular Marvel heros no credit. I mean Less Capt Marvel more Hulk kicking Thanos's head in....SMH... At least have him smash the big guy from the Dark Order vs Antman really. I mean dont even put him in the movie then. You won't give him his own movie and you wont let him kick ars in these. Why?? I did enjoy this Hulk version just wanted moreOther than that Great Movie, well put together, meaningful, and did not seem like 3 hrs. Great comedy rolled in as well. Wish DC could get the same out. Anyway go and see it, but if u are a Hulk fanatic, prepare to be disappointed.",positive
A great ending for this particular marvel storyline and cast of great actors. This movie contains ell the elements we have come to love since the first Ironman. But this time on overdrive.,positive
"I didn't know I was a fan but I was... ButFor the genre not the movie itself.I get fueled by heroism however seeing all the movies and have read 0 comics seen some animated series this end was good not great.A overal weak 6.5-6.7I am no geek for the whole package, franchise but in the impossible.I am here to share my emotions after 0 credit scene and I am full of emotions but confused, sad, empty, serenity.So I am no indepth with writers on this but I do get you want to please everyone but it becomes too much, the Thor part is probably great for many none followers and just for the average viewer, I don't think it is the writers fault but the management, vision.Cause this might the fastest 3 h you sit through and wonder what was what happens and you are left with the will of reseeing it and not in a good way.It might just be me or how I am built but even if it is 2019 and the world is what it is and actors want out, age or what not (didn't stop the cgi) it does get better with time, hence live action.So removing cast completely is just so redundant. This genre is made for the impossible why make it not so, why try and please the other half. It is not that it is unrealistic most is.People spend time remenissing most part of their life or doing things they didn't believe in until they started doing it.Sure raw and gritty but that is why you should never close a door not in this age.Having cast return should always stay open especially if you even after 2008, mind the comics, the length characters have lived even thou animated there could have been openings because the way the closed this chapter is and was rushed.This comes from me and my emotions, even my girlfriend said it was flat.Well ofcourse it was, so many characters in this with 1/3 going for slowpace, drama, not even enough time to shift paste.It is like they wanted to keep the same and all emotions from all movies and still build a story ontop and this in 3 hours time.I am all for everything and I dont need more, this is Imdb. Just using this to lead my emotions for selfclosure where the creators did not.I wish I could say all CGI in the final would satisfy me, pepper Potts spot on send off, every moment but it was a cake, you hade the sprinkle, you had layers, you had frosting but where was the passion, there was humor.You know trying to digg out something that is left missing is not easy, even if one would rage.So my gf said it was flat, as for me vs those who have more backstory and are more forgiving and accept noone can live forever.I get you. I might be that 1 procent but I am still here feeling a bit snuffed because we left the impossible behind.Maybe we don't live in a sustainable world anymore and it drives us to be more realistic and we are controlled more about numbers than guided by our own emotions.But ending it like this feels wrong, so for one printing this directly from my mind and beeing a post genius would could have been different?Well honestly it is not hard to speak for oneself.And you can't change the past as in the movies (yet)However playing with the idea is that pushing the soul stone a definite broke it all but going deeper on the same line would drag things out til the impossible.So giving the time concept multiverse would be the way to go, however. Martyrs are no longer and should have and shall never be glorified even if that embarks emotions.A true hero is one that can overcome all without self-sacrifice.I think this would and should have been the call.This leads us back to infinity war and just the strange writer decision to brand and spoil the envitable plot with the 14 miljon vs 1 outcome.For a company as any company with leaders, writers above all people with vision.A person in time gets better. An object that gets older you threat it with more respect.But with this it seems money and time talks more against than for.It is truly sad that crowd creation and funding didn't go through n before this era for fans and other followers to inject their will into the story arch as it could have.Opens up interesting view upon those who own the rights to shape and have the power to push plot, characters.For one second could have been nice with alternative ending because like Strange writers did it, 14 miljon wrong and one right.However this feel like inaccurate as for realities, infinity the soul stone sacrifice seems to be the only limit.So what is next. Well for me I will mourn Ironman the most as for the rest not as much but still..It is just truly sad everything was pushed to an end than actually have a more organic fallout.Seeing heroes grow old naturally, no time jumping leaving things over in the same pace it has been would have been nice.If I could ask a question it would have been.Why or who made you quit, was it not obvious it was done. Who pushed who, who got left behind so this happened.Was it really time for RDJ to go. And I believe not. This gap needs to be filled and if it was that easy we would have, his portrayed or joint mentality for, in and with his character people need it and copy or act it will not be possible, this is core grinded with each and one of us acting or not and cannot be copied and another replacing will not be possible cause we all realisticly could(have) see(seen) RDJ continue his journey.And this is just RDJ, there are more which falls into the same line. It is just me who connects with RDJ the strongest hence the reference.So needed to spend time writing this up to be able to go to sleep is not as good as I had hoped.But in the world we are shapeing it helps with the impossible when everyone else fails.Let that be a reminder./Cheers n take care <3",positive

"Liked Infinity War and some other Marvel movies as e.gö Thor 3 more. The story was kind of too much and too chaotic, why even hard core SciFi Fans can get disappointed by the many logical fails in this movie.",positive
Really good first half. Dreadful second half. Really boring. About 50% as good as infinity war. Very disappointing,negative
"I must admit I was more excited than my 12 and 6 yr old kids . My wife made sure to catch up to all previous details Avenger movie before the movie day.We were very proud that we made into the movie so they expectations were sky high.I must admit the movie met those as we didn't realise when 3hrs were over. Movie overall has amazing CGI and interesting plot . MCU has kept correct balance in highlighting characters as per plot requirement and specially given some time for audience to understand aftermath since half of the population of all universal species vanished . Then some interesting twists , humour ,thrills , actions and emotional scenes as movie will progress . The whole 21 MCU movie saga is very well concluded in this Endgame movie. In fact while leaving cinema there will be a thought in the mind if MCU or any other movie venture could ever replicate this experience in future and will be satisfying feeling in mind that it is good I didn't miss first of this kind .
Kids loved it , they kept chatting about movie scenes even after reaching home.
Overall we loved it !",positive
One word: AMAZING! What a satisfying culmination to this amazing franchise! I've never seen anything like it on the bug screen before! Just wow! Dont believe those who give this movie below 8 rating. They probably just want to be different ;) Seriously it exceeded my expectation like a million times!,positive
"Watched twice this movie back to back on the same day and I am still not able to tell if this is better than infinity war. I never had any thing to complain about infinity war, but I have a couple of complaints about end game.
1. I missed that HULK SMASH and an expected rematch between Hulk and Thanos.
2. Thor is the weekest in end game. He could'nt even land a punch on Thanos, even though he had storm breaker and mjolner with him.
3. I just hated captain marvel. She's so arrogant, I don't if it's coz of brie or if her character was written that way. Luckily she was'nt there for a whole lot of time in the movie. But I still hated all the moments where she saved tony from space and avengers from getting gunned down.Apart from these I think it's a great movie and I loved the final battle, but expected a little more than what we got.",positive
"Any marvel fan who was following the MCU knows that this was a climactic finish to an amazing decade of great marvel films! You may be able to watch the movie without knowing the past, but it is way better if you know the background information! If you are a fan of action movies, this is the movie to watch! Have fun watching this instant classic!!!",positive
Endgame is a very satisfying conclusion to the infinity saga. It does justice to the characters and has plenty of references to previous movies to reward the MCU followers with.,positive
"Here in China, Avengers-Endgame have been in the cinema for about 24 hours. All people are crazy now. All the cinema only provide this film. If you are a fan, please go as soon as possible. If you are not that crazy or a fan, you can go later to learn more.
This time, the Marvel movie give more time to telling the daily life of the after-Thanos life. The helping with each other, the deep sadness in everyone. People tried, people want to move on. But there will be a chance for Stark, Stark is the key. Remember, Doctor Strange is the smartest person in MCU and he give up for a reason.
There will be a big fight, there will be a hard fight. But never move your eye off the screen, every move will have a surprise. A tip, bring tissues, you will cry. I missed the Star Wars, the Harry Potter, BUT I AM IN MCU!Hail Hydra. Love you Marvel three thousand times. I will love Tony and Chris for ever. I am IRON MAN. I CAN DO THIS ALL DAY!",positive
"Although I've had my issues with many of the Marvel films, I have to say this film feels like a fitting conclusion to the massive empire Marvel has amassed. This truly felt like a superhero film to me as it was gargantuan and the film is packed with epic moments. All the triumphs the Avengers have in the film really propel them to a legendary status only works because of the years of world building Marvel has done. There's plenty of moments which inspire awe amongst Marvel fans and it thrives under a complex narrative, highlighting the true nature of heroism. The chemistry between characters feels truly authentic and the dynamic between Captain America and Iron Man in this film elevates them to generational icons, giving them the well developed characterization they deserve. The well crafted and driven plot feels much more focused than Inifinity War which was devoid of charm amongst its other issues. There was no Thanos centric plot which feels forced and each hero in the film is able to shine though their chatcter arcs. Sure we don't have all of our beloved heroes that died in infinity war, but it gives the heroes who survived the room to stand out from the crowd. This film is truly a massive blockbuster and I doubt such a massive film will be made anytime soon. This film will be a landmark in cinema and how previous generations had Star Wars and other massive blockbusters, we will have Avengers: Endgame. This film truly feels like a proper ending to an massive anthology acting as an ode to Marvel fans and cinema goers alike. This is a moment in cinematic history, like it or not, so do yourself a favor and go watch this epic blockbuster.",positive
"Slower than infinity war? Yes. But at the pace that is needed to pack in all character arch's that needed to come full circle in a movie full of so many stars you'd need 6 hands to count all of them. You will cry from excitement as well as sadness. You will get goosebumps from the very first scene all the way to the final credits. This movie is more than just a movie, it is a love letter from everyone involved to the fans and it says we've had a great journey this last 10 years. But part of the journey is the end. And I love you 3000!
Was absolutely blown away. Have seen it twice and cried more the second time than the first.",positive
"Is being overrated, kids love supper hero.7 for the action.",positive
"Fanboys are ruining the movie industry. 9,1? Really? This movie is far from the best movie of all times. It's insane and sad. Disney is cancer.",negative
When I first saw this movie it was the best and there is no movie better than this one!,positive
"Fascinating timeline despite mentioning previous MCUs storyline all together in one single movie, the 3 hours runtime doesn't feel so long due to its suspense story, there is funny moment, epic moment and the most important one.......... The heartbreaking moment. All characters have done their role very well, it is one of the greatest superhero movie of all time.",positive
As a fan of the marvel universe comic and cinematic. Tears of joy filled my eyes as the credits rolled then tears of sadness that it was all over. Endgame. Was. The. Perfect. Ending.,positive
Perfect film and great way to the end the franchise but I never thought a superhero movie would have me crying at the end. So sad for iron man but was sad happy cap America.,positive
Can't stop crying. Epic ride with A6. Eleven years. Perfect ending for them.,positive
"This is the best superhero movie ever. A perfect culminations on those twenty and something movies: it's masterfully knitted into Marvel Cinematic Universe.
People in cinema were laughing, crying and applauding. It's a great blend of drama and action. There are so many scenes that are unique and beautiful. ...And the ending is memorable...
This is a perfect ending of one MCU epoch and it's hard to believe they will ever be able to top this. And for that I feel sad.",positive
"ProsThey didn't do the obvious Captain America sacrifices himself for the cause, while it was always going to be Tony, having Black Widow sacrifice herself was a decent surprise.Fat Thor.Didn't have an over-reliance on Captain Marvel and her powers.ConsPacing just felt really weird and off to me.Having IW-Thanos so easily killed kind of eroded his potential value as a plot point and meant they relied on the really tenuous ""future Nebula mind melds with current Nebula and gives away the plot so strong Thanos can re-appear""Having used Hulk to undo the decimation, having Tony Stark use the power gauntlet solely to decimate Thanos and his forces seems a bit stupid, considering with the Power Gauntlet and as Iron Man he could have easily bested them without a snap - it's a plot holeThe worst plot hole - ""People that were decimated will come back and fit into a society that is five years removed from the one they left and no issues will be caused by that"" - what about people who moved on? What about the lack of food and other factors? It's just lazy horrible writing.The ""Girl Power"" scene - I get it; I get the female cause, I get wanting a Black Captain America to get that Black Panther dollar too - but it's such lazy writing to have them all find each other on a battle field in that particular way.We're to believe Captain America from 1940 goes back to be with Peggy (now in her late forties, early 50s) and lives a life where he watches his friend Bucky get tortured by Hydra, Shield be betrayed by Hydra despite his wife being a director and all the other travesties so he can just ""live his life""The bitter-sweet ""But Tony and Pepper have a kid"" - I think the sacrifice that could and should have been made is for Tony to realise that he has to give away the kid in order to return those that were lost to the decimation; i.e the click undoes the last five years and brings them back to the instant that Thanos clicked..",positive
"Best movie ever I seen the story line the ending everything is excellent accept loki who is the main. Character. And his wordl to Thor the sun will shine on us again, and don't change to his original color. Then why loki is not in the ending why?",positive
"As a story teller sometimes you just gotta be un-apologetically creative. When Arthur Conan Doyle brought back Sherlock Holmes from dead after his 'The Final Problem.' His last stories were still good but something was missing.I totally understand that the hype and expectation from this movie might have weighed it down a bit, but there is no denying this one could be tad better or shall I say better.Come' on we are talking about the Movie which has probably the most huge star cast ever and which is arguably wrapping up all 21 movies of it's franchise.What made 'Infinity War' a better movie is it's unpredictability. Here everyone knows Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans are cutting ties with Marvel, maybe Black Widow's death is bit unpredictable, but let's be honest, she isn't really a central character.The messed up part is the time travel, this part could be so much interesting yet the directors served a dead dud. I know it's not typically a time travel sci fi movie but it's entire story-line is based on it. And we viewers knew it as the characters died in Infinity War would not stay dead after all.I think Directors could have been a bit more brave and kill a few more characters or kept a few characters stay dead. Thanos's children or disciples are underutilized.And I was really really really hoping of an entry of a new Superhero or Supervillain, like Adam Warlock or Galactus, and my hopes were really high as Thanos died early in the movie. But they all ended up in disappointment.I can say that, this one is a good movie, maybe a great movie. But movie of the decade!! Nah. It was simply simply not that GREAT!!",positive
"I can't believe we just sat and watched this movie. There are a million different problems with this movie. Be advised we have watched all of the other Marvel movies, and have begun watching them over again with our children, and we feel totally disappointed with this last installment. I could go on forever on how it doesn't make any sense and is so disjointed... Spoilers ahead.
1. Why were there no paradoxes with the amount of interaction Thor had with his mom, Tony Stark had with his dad, and Captain America had with himself? Even Nebula met herself and then killed herself...Why didn't it impact or change anything in the future?
2. How come Tony Starks' daughter still exists if Thanos didn't get a chance to kill everyone in the first place? Wouldn't that negate the other off shoot time period?
3. How come Gamora was alive for a moment,(she lost her life due to Thanos in Infinity War) but Black Widow (who lost her life as a part of the same ritual)was dead dead? Never to return again?Other troubles:4. How come selfish Hawkeye gets a happy ending with his family after he killed his friend, and also went on a killing rampage prior to getting everything back?
5. Why did they ruin Thor and Hulk? They made Hulk the ""smart hulk"". He was straight up annoying. Thor was plain out childish. Why does the chosen ruler of Asgard, choose not to rule Asgard, and instead gives the job to Valkyrie, if not to merely push the feminine agenda and female power movement we are currently in?
6. Why did they make all the females go up against the army, alone at one point during the battle without males? Again, it felt like a commercial.
7. Assuming Captain America stayed in the past implies that there are two Captain America's in that same timeline. Eventually, it would cross over to the time when Captain America unfreezes. This would imply he is living his life in secret with Agent Carter, but then that doesn't make sense, because the old Captain America ends up on that bench in the ending timeline in an old man's jacket.
8. How come Captain Marvel doesn't age? She has been the same age since the 1990's. This wasn't explained in the movie. Although not a big concern, but something to note.
9. How come all the characters had no depth to them whatsoever, even those we have come to know and love? They were all one note and disjointed. None of them acted in the same way they had in previous movies.
There are many more plot holes and disappointing elements, but these are the ones that primarily stood out. I realize it has been explained away by saying there are multiple timelines, however the multiple timelines argument, will not give me back the three hours we wasted by watching this movie. We really hoped it would get better as time went on, only to find out it was about to get worse. So disappointing!! A big let down.",negative
"Like someone said in the previous comments up above, this movie was good but not better then Infinity and not the best. It was not an epic ending....not at all an ending. It seemed it was written for little children. I was checking my watch too in the middle of last one. We want it a maraton style and it was disappointing. Not for rhe money, not at all. For all the Saga. I'm sorry we had to say goodbye to Black Widow and Iron Man. Heiiii, but anyone has seen, o cared: WHERE WAS LOKI IN THE END? I didn't saw him at all 🤔🤔🤔",positive
"A well made collaboration of masters pieces which turn out to be an extraordinarly Marvellous Masterpiece movie of all time .
Thank you Russo brothers ....",positive
"Mind-blowing man what an end
You people are gonna love this😍😍
There are fight scenes which are amazing and the jokes 😂😂 and the emotional scenes which will make people cry 😭😭😭
Overall I give 10/10 for this movie
Great effort by the Russo brothers and the cast and the whole team dedicated to do this film",positive
"The ending of all the marvel films is in this film.It is worth an Oscar.Each and every shot is taken with perfection and it will surely send chills down your spine.It is unparalleled,uncomparable or peerless to any film in the history and surely in the future too.The greatest film ,the marvel fans have ever witnessed.The Oscar is made for #ENDGAME.#Avenge the fallen#Avengers Assemble!!!!!!!!!",positive
"Yes, I know it's blasphemy for some people, but after so much build-up and so much hype; Endgame met every expectation I had and exceeded them, which I can say was not an easy feat. The story was brilliant, as many people have said, it was not as tightly-woven as Infinity War's, but that doesn't detract much from the experience. The three hours flew by, and I had a grin on my face at every turn. The jokes landed fine and the emotional moments were, well, emotional. It is a very hard task to beat Infinity War, yet Endgame did it for me.This movie does indeed have a lot of fan service, but that is absolutely not a negative for me, especially since some of it was fantastic to see play out. My favourite part, like most, was The Avengers' Assembly. The music was brilliant throughout the film, and here the crescendo and the triumphance of the Avengers theme by Alan SIlvestri could not be matched. Thus follows the best action scene in the film and in my opinion, the best in the MCU. It was great and mind-blowing to see.Of course, the ensuing battle eventually results in Tony Stark's final ""I am Iron Man"" and a snap to end Thanos and his army. The man who started it all is gone. The movie did excellently with the character reactions from Rhodey, Peter and Pepper and their acting, along with Robert Downey Junior's, was phenomenal. The funeral and credits were suitably heart-breaking and were crafted expertly. The Russos did a great job at making it seem jubilant and melancholy at the same time. The end of an era. There is so much to talk about that I did not get to, but I commented on the best bits, and you most likely have seen it by now and can make a judgement for yourself. I will definitely continue seeing the MCU's next entries until the day I die or the day they stop and I am not going to avoid the future instalments because this Infinity Saga is over. I will instead look forward to what the future of the MCU holds, as I doubt it will ever get uninteresting. We will have to wait and see. Go watch this movie, even if you aren't a Marvel fan (as they have no doubt seen it multiple times already like I have), it is worth your time as it is a once in a lifetime experience and no way near a disappointment.",positive
"I LOVED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT HAS SUCH A GREAT DEVELOPMENT FROM THEM BEING HOPELESS TO HAVE HOPE AGAIN,ILL AFFIRM THIS AGAIN BEST MARVEL MOVIE",positive
"It's a pretty good movie and provides a good bookend to the saga. Endgame succeeds in what it tries to do in the superhero genre and deserves a high rating in that respect. Conversely, in a holistic context it's not one of the greatest movies of all time as the overall rating suggests.",positive
"This movie is EVERYTHING. There is action, and comedy, and romance. It's a story about family - both gained and blood - and it opens so many different possibilities to the future! I was laughing and crying at the same time. The cast is obviously amazing - but shout out to Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Karen Gillian.",positive
"I'm not a super huge Marvel/Avenger fan, but have enjoyed these lighthearted movies that require minimal investment to be entertaining. Infinity War upped the stakes and this movie didn't quite live up to the surprise ending of it's predecessor. However, the action is great, jeff bridges is great, their are some funny moments and the movie delivers what its supposed to. I dont' think this movie is meant to generate new Marvel fans, but it does what it's supposed to. Overall I'd put it on par with just about every other Marvel movie in terms of story telling, with a significant upgrade in terms of epicness.",positive
"Some super like heroes try to hit and kick each other for about three hours.
That's it. I really don't understand why people loves movies like this.",negative
"When I saw infinity war's ending I was immediately excited for this movie. This was easily my most anticipated movie of the year and probable of all time. When tickets went on sale I got some for the midnight premiere immediately. And somehow despite my high expectations this movie destroyed them and created a even better movie then I could have imagined.I loved every second of this movie. Even the first act were most people have complaints I loved. The second act is better then the first but man that final act is just masterpiece. Every cast member from beginning to end is amazing with Robert Downey Jr and Chris Even's being standouts. And that's not easy since I think everyone gave their best performance here and are all able to draw emotions from you. Now some directions characters take will be not suite everyone. In fact how the avengers deal with the events of infinity war isn't gonna go well for everyone. But I for one loved it. Lead to a few cheer moments. But if you wanna talk about cheer moments man that final act. No spoilers but I wanted cheer at many moments. Two moments I nearly jumped out of my set. But while it's mostly laughs and smiles when this movies wants you to feel man it'll make you feel. If you've been a long time fan (you've probable already seen it but anyway) you will choke up I know I did and I feel no shame admitting it.If you want max enjoyment out of this film. Watch the rest of the movies. I know it sounds demanding but it's worth it. Cause you'll understand meaning behind stuff. I saw it with my dad and the two moments I nearly jumped out of my seat over he was thinking ""Ah ok"" so yes do watch the other movies if you haven't before you see this one.In the end Avengers: Endgame is in my opinion is one of my favourite movies of all time and the best marvel movie to date and I ought that will change. I know I didn't say much about the movie but I'm trying to be spoiler-free and the trailers show like nothing of the movie and that's what I based my can I talk about this to not kind mind set. But I can't describe how satisfied I was. This truly was an end of an era and I all I can say is I am so glad to be apart of it. To follow these characters and become connected to them and then to finally see the conclusion this masterpiece of a story was more then worth the wait.",positive
A must watch movie but only those who have watched previous parts will understand.,positive
"Work of art, every character is well portrayed and directed. The CGI team has done an excellent job, this film will make your money's worth. Big fan of RDJ and loved his performance and a bit disappointed on how Cap and Tony's characters went down but I am completely satisfied with the story. I hope Marvel has more power packed action entertainers to bring to us in the upcoming days. The final battle is epic, watching that scene gives goosebumps to everyone as the director brings all the superheroes into a single screen and the entrance of Captain Marvel is an epic. All credits to the entire team.",positive
No words for this flim. This is an epic flim. Marvel studios never disappoint his fans.,positive
"Ok so it wasn't perfect... but came pretty darn close and I like to round up so I'll give 10/10. It had a few flaws like the way it used Thor, which was a little disrespectful but he brings some great comedic relief and when it's time for him to shine he sure does. The whole time travel idea was great and all but it leaves you with A LOT of questions. It gives you the best conclusion to this amazing franchise you could ask for. Full of unexpected twists... just know your in for a thrill.",positive
A great ending to a saga that gave me happiness in many different ways. thank you for all these years of work to reach this perfect end,positive
I just didn't wanna go did ya we go to see ya tonight at work tomorrow morning at eight and I'm gonna is your day to go get out the house so I'll text ya later I'll see you later bye love ya mom I'll text ya when y'all come pick ya guys I'll text you later I'll see you later love ya boy love you merry christler to my merry merry christler I'll be there tomorrow night I'll see ya later love you I'll text you when I'm done I'll be there,positive
A different feel than your typical avengers movie. More of an adventure than the usual action packed flick which I felt was refreshing. Sacrifices with legitimate weight behind them a great mix of intensity and emotion.,positive
Was looking forward to this but a little disappointed with how drawn out this movie was. More action and less talking for me but still a good film with excellent effects. Quite sad too in parts and sad that's the end. Some characters had better parts whilst others sadly not. Could have done more with this film but still makes for a good avengers film.,positive
"Really disappointed after watching it yesterday. Unnecessarily long, very boring finish to a series of movies with a lot of peaks (Ragnarock, GotG, CaptA) and quite a few troughs (AoU, Iron Man generally, Black Panther) but I thought this was a new low. Really poor writing, idiotic plot holes and stupid action scenes. Really sad end.. felt like flogging a dead horse, shame to go out like this.",negative
Nice to watch it. But if you did not watch other movies of this series you understand nothing,positive
"I'm giving this movie a 10/10.What I think a lot of people are missing when rating this movie so low is the fact that it's obviously going to have a different tone compared to Infinity's War. Endgame starts with hope and then is immediately shut down when Thanos admits to destroying the stones. So yes, it's going to be less ""energetic"".Certain characters are going to be handling the situation differently as well. Let's take Thor, he's completely and utterly defeated. He could have stopped Thanos in IW but didn't. So he's going to be self-destructive. Sure he was made into comic relief but he always was (let's be honest). And if you know the marvel universe at all you'd know captain America wields the hammer since he's worthy (apparently that was hard to understand). OH and did you know in the MCU/DC crossover in the comic books superman does as well??Anyway, I think if you gave yourself high expectations you wouldn't enjoy the film. Go in with an open mind and it'll be just as amazing as IW. You'll feel like a 6 year old watching your favourite cartoon crossover episode on a Saturday morning.",positive
"Here it is, the very finale. This movie is amazing. Somehow manages to be epic and dramatic. I love every part of it. It's a nice way to end the series.",positive
"The ending doesnt make any sense !!
If thanos and his army dies in the future then events that happened in infinity war should not have happen and the avengers would not have the need travel back in time in the first place and the time cycle is not right !!",positive
"Firstly, loved the film. perfect companion to Infinity War. Stark, Rogers, Romanov and Barton brought home the depth of the proceedings at the edge of their nerves in a grand way. Thor was reduced to a sad clown and Soy Hulk was a disappointment when he and Thor could have handled Thanos without his gauntlet handily. Fun twists and turns never sliding too far from comic book logic and a real spectacular Battle Royale at the demolished headquarters. So, really great ideas with a couple let downs.",positive
"Quite simply the best Marvel movie ever made and the best Marvel movie experience I've ever had. What an incredible 3 hours of cinema. I'm speechless from the last part and can't quite believe Marvel pulled off a movie with so many characters as well as they did when the MCU started just 11 years ago. The end of an era. The beginning of a new one. Marvel, you've done it again, you marvellous human beings.",positive
It's so decent that I don't have anything to say lmao.,positive
I have to say that is was the best Marvel movie so far. It left me speachless on couple ocasions. I went through all types of emotions in just 3 hours. Russo brothers did an amazing job keeping us on the dark side with the trailers. I LOVE IT!!!,positive
"A huge task to simply wrap up the first movie...but too much to ask for any movie to wrap up several more on top of it. Seems like they bit off a bit more than this movie could chew through. There are some great moments and action sequences which comes as no surprise-just wish they could have paired it down to a more manageable storyline. While kinda fun, the time travel is a bit much to take. Reminds me of some of the cornier plots from comics in the 80s.Can't wait for Marvel Woke Universe in 2020!",positive
Kids wrote plot for the movie. Ppl are getting made for nothing,negative
The best marvel movie ever.. It was epic!! You'll enjoy every moment of the 3hr2min movie. All I can say is.. We love you 3000 AVENGERS!!,positive
"I enjoyed this more than Infinity War( Infinity War is an absolute blast of a movie so not disrespecting it) purely because I kinda knew there would be a definitive ending to it. Everything you would expect from a MCU movie, the best CGI bar none, laugh out loud humour at times, swift and to the point story telling and some of the best performances from actors/characters that we have enjoyed watching since 2008. For me Chris Evans and RDJ are genuinely a joy to watch on screen together. What I came away with after watching this film is an urge to go back to the beginning, watch all find in the order they were intended ( Cap America, Iron Man etc...) and maybe see them in a new light and understand more how everything ties together leading up to Endgame.Go watch it, then watch it again and then revisit the MCU from the beginning is what I would recommend. Well done Marvel!",positive
Sir please add IMAX VERSION of this movie. ALL the movie is so great that every time i watch it gives me more details. And today is the day when i watch it again so add it as soon as possible.,positive
This is the very best marvel studios has to offer you should go and buy the DVD or the blu-ray every moment is worth enjoying,positive

"The movie is good but it does not surprise at all but to see what expected possibility is chosen. Capitan Marvel and due to the overdose of characters, the other too, lack of the opportunity of developing well in the movie. Maybe the script should be more developed in two movies. Anyway, good for a lot of people.",positive
"This movie was a perfect wrap up to the Avengers franchise. This movie will have you laughing, clapping (more than you think), and of course... crying. When Iron man said in the trailer ""part of the journey is the end..."" he is very true. Go see this movie!",positive
"Avengers ""Infinity War"" was very intriguing, so the expectations for ""Endgame"" were very high. The cast did an excellent job, although some of lines were hard to understand under the sound mix. The Special effects are pretty stunning, especially in 3D and the product placement is very stylish, neat and futuristic. A nice send off for Stan Lee and his characters. This movie explains a lot of back stories of the spermatozoon heroes and leaves room for development. The cinematography is very convincing as well as wardrobe and props.
Entertaining to watch and the long running time seems shorter than it is.",positive
"Expected a lot more honestly. Infinity War was way better. After they make out the plan, everything is predictable.",negative
"You can't ask more than this from the makers of movies like these...... Just remember, they have given you a memorable gift which will stay with you forever! And this indeed makes the movie itself and you a special entity! Avengers Infinity War & Endgame....A movie which is making/has made a class of it's own!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",positive
"First time watching the movie it felt like the greatest movie ever but second time watching it I could understand why some people didn't like it that much. It was a very entertaining movie to watch but had some major plot holes.
First of all they could've done so much better with the captain marvel,hulk and thor I mean they are three of the most powerful characters in the MCU but they didn't have any major contributions to the plot of the movie Second of all if you want to do a movie about time travel you have to do your research specially if you're making fun of other time travel movies. Say even if sorcerer supreme was right and the future as in the ""present"" could not be changed even if you altered the past and alterations in the past only results and new branches of timeline, then how the hell did cap end up in the ""normal"" present if he went back in time and in doing so changed the past. He should've just ended up in a not another timeline.
Thirdly although Tony's death that was really sad, I can understand why he was the one I had to die for everyone else to win ( because he was the one who started the whole thing and he was the one I had to finish it and he kinda already got his happy ending ) but the thing that bothers me is how he died. He deserved a more epic death than that because his death was totally unnecessary.He didn't even need to snap his fingers since Thanos's army was already beat without him having the gauntlet . And don't get me started on the new gauntlet, With all the trouble that Thanos had to go through in infinity war to build a gauntlet, Tony just did that in a day with earthly technology??!
Lastly although cap deserved his happy ending but to leave your best friends who by the way you just got reunited with like five hours before and to go and live with some girl that you met 50 years ago?!? I mean most people would've moved on I guess not him though
In all and all it was a very great movie to watch and I cried I laughed but I couldn't help but think that they maybe could've done better .",positive
What an incredible way to put a closure to this amazing story. I really couldn't ask for a better ending. Thank you for all of you who make this movie happens.,positive
"That was my best experience from Avengers, Great Great Everything was great",positive

"The grand finale of the Avengers' saga, which began over ten years ago with ""Iron Man,"" comes to its epic conclusion. Just like the first Avengers movie featured every Marvel character that had had a movie at the time, Marvel's entire cinematic pantheon is involved in this battle, making for one hell of an extensive cast list. With exactly half of those characters being dead at the opening of this chapter (see Infinity War), the survivors find themselves in a desperate state. They've never dealt with defeat on this scale before, and though they do rally and make one more attempt defeat Thanos and restore what was lost, they find that there truly is no coming back from this one. Their defeat is total, and their losses are quite permanent. Over the next few years, they do their best to accept this and move on. A hero thought lost returns unexpectedly, however, bringing with him a chance to turn things around.Every character has their moment to shine.For characters whose sagas ended with this movie, adequate time is allotted to bring their stories to a fitting, satisfying close. Tony completes his transformation from selfish billionaire to selfless hero, making the sacrifice play that Cap once said he never could have made. Steve keeps the promise he made to Peggy decades ago, before he made his own sacrifice play. None of it feels rushed or abrupt.The attention to detail that is paid to each of the unprecedented number of characters should serve as an example for future epics on this scale. Classic lines from earlier movies are reprised, reinforcing the sense of continuity that has been so important in making these characters as beloved as they are, and in maintaining the integrity of the shared universe that they inhabit.The only negative I could think of is the death of Black Widow. Thanos sacrificing his daughter to get the Soul Stone made sense. Not only was he dedicated to his task, moving forward in his quest with the courage of his convictions, he was also the bad guy. Heartless acts like killing one's own daughter to obtain ultimate power become villains like he. The heroes, self-sacrificing individuals they may be, should have been able to find a way to get the Soul Stone without having to murder a loved one.",positive
"22 films (i think) culminated to this. More than 10 years led upto this. Not disappointed. This has never been done before, and it was done properly. The effects and performance was on point. The time travel made it very confusing though. It's a matinee movie, as all marvel movies are. But: it's a milestone in cinematic history. For someone who only has a very basic understanding of the comics, I felt it was easy to grasp and came together nicely.",positive

"Im a huge Marvel fan, and yes i liked Endgame, but lets be honest... Its not even near 9 or 10 stars. Its more like 6 or 7 stars. Without spoling too much, i have to say the movie is too messy, with duplicated characters, that u can't define who's on each side. Infinity war was way better, than this movie.",positive
Endgame is a movie that makes the audience cry and laugh through the entire three hour long run time. It's laughably bad and sadly disappointing.,negative
I don't understand why some people are giving it 1 star.,positive
"Entertainment. It seemed to me that there were fewer special effects, but the quality did not suffer from this, it looks in one breath. Marvel has definitely become a trendsetter in special effects. I will especially note how either make-up artists or computer scientists worked on Thor. In general, Chris Hemsworth, as it seems to me, will be remembered by many as TOR. Five.The acting. On high. It is impossible to single out anyone in particular, everyone did an excellent job with their roles. Five.Originality. In my opinion, only the quality of the film can be called unoriginal, as it continues to maintain a very high quality of the saga. Otherwise, the development of the film is completely unpredictable. For me, for example, there were several plot twists that were completely unexpected. But the most unexpected thing for me was the absence of two videos after the credits. Definitely five.Music and sound. If there was something wrong with this film with the soundtrack, it would surprise me very much. And so, in terms of sound accompaniment, everything is tip-top, there is nothing to be surprised at. Five.",positive
"I actually don't know how I can review this movie in words, I really loved watching it. I didn't watch the other avengers movies, but that wasn't necessary, the story and the plot was great and I understood it very well.",positive
"Exactly a year has passed since the mighty titan Thanos made a fatal click, mercilessly spraying half of the living beings in the universe. Then this bold and unexpected ending shocked many, forcing them to wait for the final round with even greater trepidation. What kind of theories were not built by fans about the upcoming sequel - one is crazier than the other, but everyone agreed that it would be something grandiose, epoch-making, claiming to be another box office record. And now the painfully familiar hype is repeated, cinemas are bursting with hungry crowds and circuses, and those who have already had a chance to see this product, are ecstatic about what they saw. Or is it still not abiding?..""Infinity War"", without exaggeration, brought the comic genre to a new level. It turned out that even in a story stuffed to the brim with fantastic creatures and superheroes, there may be a place for notes of drama, a colorful villain with a clear motivation, moderately pretentious speeches and, most importantly, the best character interaction in the history of the comic book adaptation. As a result, we are no longer just a humorous blockbuster with an armful of special effects, but a pretty serious movie that causes genuine emotions, and sometimes even dumb admiration. Long before the premiere, the Russo brothers said that the upcoming ""Finale"" and the ""Infinity War"" preceding it, in fact, are one big film divided into two parts a la ""The Lord of the Rings"". However, if ""The Return of the King"" organically fit into the canvas, becoming the best film of the trilogy, then ""Avengers: Finale"", alas, completely lost to its predecessor, spoiling everything that allowed ""Infinity War"" to break out of its genre and win praise from people far from the world of comics.The film begins very promisingly. Against the background of the prevailing gloom and general hopelessness, the heroes try to somehow fix the situation, but in the end they only experience bitter disappointment. Everyone copes with this in different ways: Tony Stark, who miraculously escaped from the space desert, settles in the forest with his wife, Captain America runs a therapeutic circle, Thor turns into an alcoholic and a glutton, and Hawkeye, who lost his family, like Yagami Light, punishes criminals in different parts of the planet. Dr. Benner uses the allotted time to establish contact with his green neighbor, and only the Black Widow, being a professional to the core, coordinates the actions of the remaining superheroes, including the Warrior, the orphaned raccoon and Captain Marvel, who joined them. It would seem that such an oppressive atmosphere was supposed to bring the necessary drama, but in the end the viewer feels only a deleterious delay for an entertaining movie. The move does not work properly, as general despondency and mass depression are diluted by an endless stream of humor. Of course, jokes-jokes have long become a well-known feature of Marvel films, and it would be madness to abandon them, but scenes with tombstones and crying people a priori will never get along with scenes where we are shown a fat Thor and the Hulk riding a truck to cheerful music. The artificiality of what is happening is evident in almost every frame, and the viewer simply cannot feel all the pain of losses together with the heroes. As a result, the drama ceases to be a drama, and the absence of any action at the initial stage makes the film bland and ordinary at all. The balance in the narrative that Infinity War could boast of was completely lost. If there for the first hour we could observe the Hulk's fight with Thanos, the scuffle of the titan's retinue with the defenders of the Earth and the harsh exit of the Cap, which were proportionally interspersed with meaningful conversations, then the ""Finale"" cannot boast of anything like this. The drama does not work, there is no action, and before us is almost a product that claims to be the reference picture of the genre.To some extent, it turns out to be cured of the disease in the second third of the film, when Ant-Man comes to the forefront with his grandiose plan. Here, references to popular paintings of the past, which amuse much better than silly jokes, have come in very handy. Well, the plan itself, in general, did not come as a surprise, because for anyone who is familiar with the fantastic crafts of famous directors, such an idea will be a priority. Scenario-wise, this move is logical and correct, since the Russo brothers kill not even two, but three birds with one stone: they link all the films of the series together, which looks reasonable and justified, play on nostalgic feelings and, in fact, move the plot in the right direction. However, there are problems with the implementation again. The authors of the film do not offer any clear rules, and in some places this excursion into the past looks like a saddle on a cow. There is no need to worry about the heroes, because their actions in the past do not affect events in the future in any way. It is a pity that the screenwriters were too lazy to complicate the plot layers with any creative ideas, leaving the viewer alone with their questions, which, upon closer examination, multiply exponentially. The only advantage is the opportunity to look at the Avengers through the eyes of Marty McFly with the help of a number of augmented and expanded scenes. Creative, fresh and cheerful.Thanos' exit. The third phase of the film is by far the coolest and most epic. The mighty titan turned out to be an intelligent and respectable opponent. Appearing in front of an impoverished squad of avengers in his shining armor, he cut the ribbon with a huge two-handed sword and opened the way for unrestrained computer action. Thus, the authors seemed to apologize for the ""stagnation era"" reigning in the first half of the film. The unfolding battle is filled with references to comics, blood, pain and fear for the fate of the defenders of the Earth. The culmination was the clash of the united forces of good with the legions of Chitauri and the entire retinue of the enraged Thanos. It looks really epic. It is no exaggeration to say that since the Battle of Minas Tirith, cinema has not seen such an impressive on-screen battle.The entire Marvel movie series is filled with contradictions. Over the long ten years, studio bosses have revealed 22 paintings to the world, among which there were both recognized masterpieces and frankly passing tapes. And this epic ended on an equally contradictory note. On the one hand, the ""Finale"" competently summed up the events of past paintings, put everything in its place with a sin in half and was even able to delight with an epic battle at the end. But on the other hand, the final part was supposed to be the crown of creation, the best picture of the series, which, alas, did not become. After all, from the point of view of plot construction, character interaction, drama and action, the ""Finale"" lost not only to the ""Infinity War"", but also to the first ""Avengers"", who were inferior to it only in terms of scale. An attempt to sit on three chairs at once did not lead to anything good, and the fear of moving away from the template and introducing something new eventually deprived the long-awaited film product of due originality, turning it into an ordinary pop gum.",positive

"Not really much to say. The culmination of an epic era of an epic franchise, gives us an epic film with epic states.Continuing on from the events of 'Infinity War', this blockbuster lays it all on the line. I personally had goosebumps for near the full three hour long experience, that went by like a flash. Yes, I would describe this piece of art as an experience rather than a film.It made me laugh, cry, tense up, sigh, cheer (inside). With an outstanding score and one of the greatest ensemble casts in history, this film is the greatest superhero film to date, sorry 'The Dark Knight' but you've got nothing on the ultimate climax of the MCU.",positive
"I finally watched Avengers endgame,last night all I can say was I cry I got excited I got leak Goosebumps all over want to watch the whole film this was an epic conclusion for all the seven original Avengers I love the film from start to finish and the last battle was epic , my owning negative it is about the film was what they did for Thor of making him fat and weird, overall really loved the film I'll be seen this film over and over again and especially when the DVD comes out.Going to miss the original 7 Avengers and very sad with what happened to the Black widow and iron Man I couldn't believe iron man got killed because of the infinity gauntlet.And the final battle was absolutely epic.",positive

"Endgame is a good movie which achieves its ultimate goal of tieing the series, up to now, together. But frankly it's a mess....sometimes a glorious mess but often an incoherent mess. There's a lot to love, but a lot to dismiss. It lacks any great action scenes and spends too much time in discussion, and hackneyed emotional nonsense. The plot is over-stuffed, and the movie suffers from trying to do too much. However, it frequently looks spectacular and is genuinely funny, the clear highlights are Thor, who is hilarious in every scene and Ant-Man who brings levity to a sometimes dour plot.It's a solid film, but it's not great. 7/10",positive

"""part of the journey is the end."" He started this fanatic era, and he should be the one to end it. Even though with the predictable and inevitable outcome. I still chose to believe that he deserves a happy ending. I had one last sense of sanity when the big 3 were fighting against Thanos, my irrationality overwhelmed and took every last of it when Pepper kissed on his cheek.
I don't remember how many times I've seen the movies in MCU, and admittedly I really admire, even crave for the appearance and moral integrity that Steve rogers possesses. After Civil war when people pointed their moral compasses about whether signing the accords was a right thing to do, my affection of Captain and him was way too deep for me to make my stance. But today, right before his sacrifice, the answer was coming right at me- It was always him. He's the perfect reflection of my real life-textbook narcissism, volatile and self-obsessed;
The hero basically every man dreamed of: genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. When everyone thinks he values individualism above collective goods, he carried the nuke through the wormhole, he knew that going in the quantum realm might causing him significant losses but still risked his life and brought back trillions of people and he knew putting on the infinity stones would jeopardize his own life but he did it to keep his promise: ""If we can't protect the earth you'll be damn well sure we'll avenge it.
There is no and never will be a better ironman rather than RDJ, hope you have a nice reunion with Howard, Mr. Stark, peace in our time.",positive
"What a movie, the geniuses of the director, producer, and writer. It transformed the prosaic characters - the normal to Professor Hulk, the muscular to the rotund Thor which elicited laughter and so much humor. The clever plot and action-combat that kept me glued to the chair for 180 minutes.I enjoyed this movie a lot and has always been a fan of comics esp. The Avengers. For the records, Chris Evans which played Captain America handed an adamantium shied to a successor. Chris Evans is irreplaceable. I am not sure whether to watch Captain America sequel again under different role. Both characters are awesome.Robert Downey Jr. died. The ever gorgeous Scarlett Johansson died. I am quite sure marvel will find a way to undo their death as how the vanished halves of the superheroes were brought back to life in the movie. Avengers will no longer be that great without the abovesaid names playing respective superheroes - because Evans, Johansson, and downey Jr. are indispensable! I don;t care if Tobey McGuire is substituted.10/10 and I am waiting to see whether this mega-blockbuster could beat Titanic as No. 1 highest grossing movie of all time....",positive

"First off, I want to preface the fact that I'm not a diehard Avengers fan. I've found the previous movies to be entertaining and I've enjoyed watching them for the most part, but I have never be blown away after seeing one until now. All I can say is WOW! I never thought I would experience such a wide range of raw emotion from watching an Avengers movie. The acting was incredible, the story line was rich and the pace of the movie and how it unfolded was spot on. There was never a point where I felt the movie was dragging on or plateaued. Usually I wouldn't be able to sit through a 3 hour movie (even my 5 year old was engaged in the movie the entire time - crazy, right?!) without falling asleep but I honestly didn't want this movie to end. It had just the right amount of action and heart felt drama. It wasn't predictable in the least- characters or storyline. They incorporated all of the characters flawlessly and it was impossible for me to not fall in love with every single one of them. I experienced so much joy from the humor alone because it was genuine humor and not full of the typical cliche jokes and one liners that some of the past Avengers movies have had. On the other side of the coin, the movie is a tearjerker. I don't think there was a dry eye in the entire theatre during the sad parts-my eleven year old son and my boyfriend were even tearing up. I would definitely recommend this movie a thousand times over. You will NOT be disappointed.",positive
"Many other reviews have mentioned this already but I had to add my 2 cents. Thor and Hulk. Utter trash what the Russo's did to them.Also the film just was not good enough. Especially to end such a dramatic and exceptional story arc like the infinity war. Just not good enough. Was not horrible but I am a bit disappointed.Also all that talk about not doing too much to change the past and how they can just go back, grab the stones, use the gauntlet and then put them back and all is good? Uhh what about killing Thanos from 9 years in the past in present time? So no infinity war.....no attack on new york....really curious if phase 4 addresses any of that.",positive
So boring and predictable story with cringe moments such a dissapointment,negative
"The only reason why I'm giving this movie a 10 star rating is so both Infinity War and Endgame will have an average weighed out rating of 8 stars so I know everyone will be excited to see both movies. If you haven't seen Infinity War yet, you might want to watch that first before Endgame. After you've seen Infinity War, you're gonna love Endgame even better. Yes, some of the Avengers lives are lost, including Tony Stark's, but this 3 hour movie is a great and perfect for the very last avengers movie. I would recommend it. I think it's still playing in certain theaters, so if your theater is playing it, why not give it a try? It may be a really long movie, but they needed tell the entire story after 1/2 of the world population was lost. This basically tells it all. Thanos eventually gets killed in the end, and everyone returns for one last fight. This last avengers film is perfect for any MCU fan, and also great for certain fans who didn't understand the ending of Infinity War. Get it on DVD if you can! It's a really really great Marvel film!!",positive
I loved how it starts and how it ends. I can't put words into this. Totally worth the wait for 10 years for the whole MCU.,positive
"I have watched the first part many, many times. Every minute of it was accounted for with importance to the plot - not wasted on snowflake emotions.This second half has an excellent plot, but oh, my - how it dragged on with talk and tears!I also didn't like Pepper suddenly being outfitted as a fighter?! Lol! And, considering the future hero roles revealed in this one, can we eventually expect a white Black Panther, too?! Don't get me wrong - I don't want to see a white Black Panther.Several other points of disappointment, too.",positive
"I really love Marvel. It's a strong movie for fans. Very sad. Beloved heroes are dying. But I really liked the battle in this movie at the end, when all the Marvel heroes united and fought against Thanos. An epic appearance of the heroes, a logical ending, but very sad. Marvel is something very interesting. I love superheroes and that's why this movie ended well. Sorry for Tony. This film seemed to me something very cosmic and touching. Every year some Marvel movie was released. Thanks to Stan Lee for his childhood. Actually, the movie is cool, I advise you to watch, do not forget popcorn and drinks you will need a lot of them!!!",positive
"After all this time the Russo Brothers give us the moment that we had been waiting for 11 years..in this spectacular of a movie ""Avengers Endgame"" they give you all of the things you could have never imagined..the emotional weight of the movie is just about perfect but the Fight scenes specially the epic battle sequences in the end are the match winner..i dont think that such a grand scale of action ladded battle containing all of our heroes will ever take place in the MCU...All in all this movie is a spectacular action piece, has a great story telling and deserves to be watched by every Marvel fan..believe me you are so not ready for this!! <3 Avengers Assemble!! :)",positive
"I must apologize to the highly intelligent, mature, and extremely loyal fans because I the average, dumb, 10 year old, who started watching marvel yesterday as suggested by other reviews, found this movie to be one of the greatest cinematic experiences. The build up was great, the nostalgia was amazing, the last act was actually the best scene I've ever witnessed and trust me I've watched hundreds if not thousands of movies. I laughed a lot even more than Ragnarok and Deadpool; I cried a lot more than anytime in the last couple of years. I watched the movie again the very next day and still experienced the same emotions. Stan would be proud. I thought to myself that the Russos wouldn't be able to ruin this movie due to the success but never in my wildest dreams did I expect them to maximize the potential of this movie exceeding my wildest expectations. Again I apologize for the intelligent haters, since you have a very high IQ and you saw everything coming, you won't be able to relate to my review about this ""lazy written"", ""fan servicing"", and ""contradicting"" movie.",positive
"I like superhero movies like Spiderman 1 & 2, which have simple common storyline and great action. Avenger 2012 was good too. But these final 2 movie of Avenger are really overhyped. These two avenger movie are not good as Avenger 2012.
It is so successful in box office that is the best part of it.
It's not a great movie as we expected and rating in IMDB will going to be fall down. my rating for this movie is 6/10. The main problem in the movie is, they try hard to be sentimental but for me superhero movie means a lot of action and good-feel kind of story.",positive
"Avengers endgame is what 21 movies led up too and I promise I that this movie blew expectations no surprise if that but also made our 10 year journey a thrill ride I thank u marvel u made us connect with these heroes along the ride from the very begging ( Iron man 2008) to this masterpiece . this movie had everything us fans wanted and way more kudos to the Russo brothers u both have done an outstanding job I literally love u guys because u both knew what we wanted . this movie was a 100/100 no lie this movie will stick in our hearts forever and again I thank u marvel . this movie had it all joy,sadness,excitement , great super hero moments , dark, light there was absolutely nothing wrong here no surprise to that aswell. All in all I can finish up by saying thank u avengers for everything this movie shocked the he'll out of me and I couldn't help but to cry tears of joy when the end credits rolled on I cried not once or twice but four times this was truly the perfect conclusion and aswell as a new beginning",positive
"I am going to ignore all the plot holes for this movie because there are a lot of them. I will be basing this review solely on my own experience i had with this movie.Before i start i just want to tell all the angry so called 'fanboys' that i have read a lot of the comics and watched all Marvel movies since 2008. So please try to respect anothers opinion and listen to what i have to say.Ok, so i really loved but also hated this movie at the same time. I thought it started beautifully with showing all the loss and the devestation of Thanos. But i already took an issue with the placement of the music in certain scenes. They put in mediocore 'sad music' in scenes that didn't need music at all. A lot of times when you want the audience to pay attention to the script and what people are saying in emotional moments music isn't needed. It can sometimes only take away from the feelings that you are ment to feel in that scene. And that is actually one of my biggest problems with this movie. THERE WAS NO IMPACT. This movie played it sooo save even after 28 other movies. They only killed Tony and Black Widow. Ofcourse Iron Man's death was expected and therefor less impactful. I do have to give credit to the execution though, i thought it was very well done and they did Iron Man a lot of justice in this movie. I loved that and i also hoped to see that.But lets get back to the impact problem. In Many Marvel movies we expected people to die. The Avengers (possibility), Age of Ultron (Only Quicksilver what is again cheating because it made no impact again), Civil War (this could have been a masterpiece if there were bigger consequences) etc. But every time we were like: 'ah its ok we understand because we know Thanos is coming and he is going to truly destroy everything' Then Infinity War arrived. One of the best Marvel movies by far, but again no impact. Cause killing people with the snap and not even main character is just weak. We all know Spider-Man and Black Panther are coming back because they have there own solo films coming up. Marvel has just been a victim of the Disney effect and its keeping them down from even more potential imo. Now i know some simple fans will read this and be like: 'what is he talking about it had massive impact a lot of people died!' but no guys, just no. Logan is a good example of a movie with real consequences. Every decision they make have a reaction. When they decide to help the family on the road and after that stay with them, they feel good and have a real family moment that they hadn't had in years. But at the same time that decision made that family a target and they eventually even get slaughterd by X-24. Also Logan decides to sacrifice himself for the new generation of mutants. He goes to the woods to fight an whole elite squad + X-24 eventhough he knows it will be his death, and eventually he does. In Endgame, the Avengers have to fight the biggest threat that the MCU has to offer, but does that really show at the end of the day? The awnser to that question is NO. They brought back every character that they killed in Infinity War (also Loki), exept for Vision. In Endgame they only really kill Iron Man, and therefor only show respect tot that character. 'but black widow died!' Nobody cares that black widow died. She was just as underdevelopt as the plot of Justice League, so don't hate on DC for reasons that are just as bad for some characters with Marvel.So consequences make it more realistic, and when a movie is more realistic its more reletable and it makes you even more invested in the characters, and therefore elevating the whole movie. Now that is why impact is so important. WE HAVE FOLLOWED THESE CHARACTERS FOR 10 YEARS. This movie is even called Endgame, like common. Imo at least Cap should have died too. Him sacrificing himself for the world, that is Captain America to the core of his characters and true fans know this. I swear i would have cried like a baby if that would have happend, but no. Disney ofcourse wants to please the children because they make them money, but it is a disrespect to the art of the content. Also i want to note that Thanos didn't even come close to the threat he was in Infinity War. I would have prefered to see a end fight with only the main Marvel characters but not a whole army, and them just taking on Thanos with the Infinity Glove (maybe missing one stone) so that you would be in constant fear of characters dying and really rooting for them. Instead they gave us a lesser and full CGI version of a LOTR battle with random beasts and armies that you will forget about in the next year.There i said it.People please try to be critical and not just accept everything that gets thrown at you.conclusion: It had beautiful little moments like Tony's reunion with is father and Tony's story overall carried this movie. But it was definitly not on the level that Infinity War was. therefor i give it a 7",positive
Glad I only wasted $4 watching this awful movie. 3 hrs I never get back . I really liked Guardian of the galaxy and infinity war . But this is just trash .,negative
This movie is just flat out incredible. I have loved this franchise since the very first Iron Man and they wrapped it up beautifully in Endgame.,positive

"Endgame was written to be the epic conclusion of 20-plus marvel movies. It is a good conclusion but not an 'epic' one. Every character is given a good arch and heartfelt moments. The movie just lacks the magic of Infinity War. There are very few fight scenes until the big fight at the end, and I just found myself getting impatient, waiting for something to happen. The plot was jumping around a lot and sometimes things just seemed to happen so quickly, which is weird when many scenes seemed to drag on. Nebula contributed heavily to the plot, but I don't think it made enough sense, and it also makes Nebula the most annoying character, as she already gave away the soul stones location in Infinity War. Everything about Hulk felt off, and Captain Marvel just didn't fit in. To be fair, there are some amazing moments in the final act, and I finally got the action I was craving. But by then, I had somewhat disconnected for the movie. What I loved about Infinity War is it starts with amazing momentum and never stops. Endgame took just a little too long to establish itself. Even once the Avengers start executing their plan, there is very little action or epic moments. I also think Thanos was underplayed in the movie, as were the use of the infinity stones or any superhero powers. The heroes definitely could've played around more with their settings as well. Maybe it will be better when watched in conjunction with Infinity War, and maybe I'm a little too much of a Thanos fan. All in all, it's a good watch but the movie failed to make me feel the emotions I felt from Infinity War.",positive
"There's action, there's emotion, there's drama, there's sci touch. A complete package!
What a way to end a decade long legacy.",positive
Even if your not a comic book fan this is a good movie. A bit long but well written.,positive
"Imagine you have to write Endgame. You would have to find a way to reconcile several things: the expectations of the audience, the continuity not only with the other movies, but with future projects and past comic book ideas, the actors that just won't come back whatever the reason, America's unhealthy obsession with political correctness, the wishes of the producers, the wishes of the director, the wishes of the people paying for the movie. It is an nearly impossible task. As a solution to this conundrum, Avengers: Endgame was really decent. It has character build up, exposition - maybe too much of it, foreshadowing, great action scenes, great emotional scenes, great acting. It got rid of all the leaving actors in a very nice way for their characters. It solved the problem of the death of so many living creatures in a way that didn't mean everything was simply undone or redone or forgotten.That being said, all the characters in this film are dumb. I mean, really dumb. They have lightning fast reactions, but their solutions are ridiculous. The whole concept of the solution, which I don't want to spoil, lends itself to improvement.; it was not spent in this story. Also, there is a key moment that ends (heh) it all... it could have been done minutes before. All the elements where already there. And there are so many logic holes in the plot that my mind just reels from thinking about it.Bottom line: a very beautiful film for your heart. Doesn't do your brain any good.",positive
"Lots of problems but still entertaining. Captain ex machina was awful, and it does seem like a lot of the problems stemmed from her - just a few avengers in infinity war were an even match for Thanos with stones, meanwhile here it took all of them while he had no stones. Professor hulk and Thor were both depowered and super disappointing. Still a fun movie but by far the worst avengers movie.",positive
"This was the perfect send off to what has been an amazing journey. I laughed, I cried, and I don't know how they managed so much in three hours. The film didn't let up at all and was worth the lack of sleep before work tomorrow (midnight screening and 9am start).",positive
"It is good for Marvel fans, but not everyone. People wanna see some real movies,don't try this.",positive
"Did i watch the same movie as everyone else? why are so many people leaving such high ratings for this movie? i guess it being the end of it factors in, but it just wasn't a good film. some good parts, but they take up like 3% of the film.",negative
"Fight scenes weren't satisfactory enough, it should included more epic clashes.
Didn't like the new Hulk.
Dr Strange didn't show up much",positive
"This is a 182 minute movie... that's 3 hours and a bit in old money. It's a long one. In the first 30 minutes it was threatening to be the slowest start to a movie since three hobbits went on a long walk but it turns a corner and keeps on moving forwards leaving the audience captivated and riveted. By the 2 hour mark we are back to the future past and there wasn't a moment to pop for a toilet break. The packed Cinema had fallen silent with all foodstuffs consumed and everyone glued to the action. This is Marvel on steroids.. Massive cast, stunning visual effects and some great funny dialogue (with very satisfying other movie references) ... there's no typically resounding finale as the action switches to tug gently at the hearts of movie goers who have invested in these characters over the years. There were several teary eyed people in amongst this audience beyond the end-game... I thought they might be tears of tiredness but my initial cynicism was rewarded by a sentimental and charming conclusion. That said I would doubt that this really is the end-game ... but if it was then it was a good one.",positive
"So here we have it, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, the expansive sequel to not only AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR but also to the whole last 13 years or so of Marvel cinema. It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.The time travel plot might seem a cop out to some, but I really enjoyed the way it gives characters a chance to revisit earlier productions (and even allow the likes of Robert Redford to show up in clever cameos). The climactic action is well worth the wait and bests the battles in LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING in terms of pure CGI spectacle; it only took them 16 years to get it right. Great fun, anyway, and one for the ages.",positive
"The first scene being a homage to Jeremy Renner training his daughter to take over the mantel of ""Hawkeye"" was enough to make me instantly get overjoyed & excited-not only for the film we've waited so long for, but for what comes afterwards as well with the Disney+ shows and new phase of films.
The feeling of division & failure from the events of Infinity War are completely reversered in this film (besides a handful of moments).
From Thor finnaly having a rock bottom & getting Mjnoir back, to the Hulk finally finishing his 3-movie-arc (with Mark Ruffalo absolutly knocking it out of the park), to Captain America being worthy enough to finally wield Mjnoir (something hinted at in Age if Ultron). There are so many more moments like these that really bring the last 21 movies to fruition, especially Chris Evans' ""Captain America"" finally fully-saying ""Avengers Assemble!"" during the end battle and him finally getting that life with Peggy he always wanted and deserved.
This film was nothing like I anticipated going in. As fast paced as the events in Inifinity War unfolded it was nice having a smoother yet edgy feeling during Endgame, as well as an extremely emotional yet satisfying ending that any (normal) person would consider one of the best conclusions to not only a film, but a saga. Go see it, you will not regret it.",positive
One of the best ending no doubtWe are all satisfied 😍,positive
"The end of the saga is always something grandiose. Epochally failed or great, but invariably loud. For those who have watched all or at least most of the films of the cinematic universe, it cannot but evoke emotions. Whatever it is. Because 21 tapes before him have already built up most of this ending. They set the direction, developed the characters, the dynamics between them, created certain expectations, hopes and fears for us. The ""Finale"" itself had only to run through these strings. I believe that the ""Infinity War"" was more ambitious, unexpected and bold. It's better as a movie, stronger, but at the same time I myself found fault with it more than I want to find fault with the ""Finale"". Who could have guessed that Sasha Bashkirov, who did not get into the ""War"" at all, would call the ""Finale"" a masterpiece? Why was Denis Varkov, with all his knowledge of the comic universe, not bribed, but only upset by all these rather elegant moves with the main characters?Because this is no longer a movie, and we are not discussing it as a movie. Cinematography, lighting, acting - all this seems deeply secondary. We discuss solutions - what we did with this character, how we dared to complete the arc of this, who we decided to kill and who we decided to resurrect. And that's why neither I nor anyone else will be able to tell you if you like the movie. The same moments of ""Endgame"" can both move you to tears and cause boredom, how to charm, forcing you to close your eyes to the next hundred minuses and absurdities, and force you to get up and leave the hall. These are no longer more or less objective questions of the value of the story and the success of the choice of methods of its presentation, it is a matter of purely personal preferences, expectations, the final of the saga that you have collected in your head and dreamed of seeing on the screen.",positive
"It's sad to see that Marvel ""fans"" are hating this film and not even trying to understand why this film is different from the flashy, action-packed, Avengers film that we've gotten so used to. The aftermath of Infinity War left a scar on each of the remaining heroes. That's what they're dealing with here, not some giant robot or intergalactic force out there to destroy the world.",positive
One word review masterpiece. Can't explain or give further . Its beyond reviewing. Speechless. A must watch .,positive
Some of the scenes were unnecessary and could've been just cut out entirely and the movie would still make sense. I expected more from this 3-hour film but it turned out to be just a complete waste of time.,positive
I know there are a lot of hardcore Marvel fans out there but it baffles my brain that this movie gets the praise that it gets. Infinity War was a decent movie but Endgame is pretty bad. Iron Man and Spiderman were great. The Dr. Strange reveal where you realize this is the exact thing he predicted as the only successful way to defeat Thanos was actually pretty darn good. What throws it off is the Disney political correctness. What the actual f*$k was that girl power scene towards the end? It made me so unbelievably un-immersed it is insane. I don't truly believe this is a 1/10 but imma give it a 1/10.,negative
"I'm not going to include any spoilers, I'm just going to say: if you're a MCU fan and have enjoyed what Feig et al have achieved so far, WATCH THIS MOVIE. It is breathtaking, the perfect dénouement for Phase 3. Bravo Team MCU. 👍",positive
"As ""Avengers: Endgame"" comes to a close, so does 10 years of marvelous movie-telling. To criticize it would be objective, and as it cumulate 21 movies before it, being unemotionally objective brings it no fairness.*** Beware, SPOILERS ahead ***Throughout the runtime of the movie, not only do the Avengers travel thru time, but so do we. To relive our childhood sensations when we were first introduced to these characters is a scripting masterpiece. Though the heroes were on an explicit mission to retrieve the Infinity stones before Thanos, the scriptwriters and directors successfully accomplished theirs by sending us back with the heroes to witness them one last time, to finally bid them farewell.STORY/PLOT: Rumors always had it that time travel must be part of the equation to undo the Snap. Nonetheless, the various theories were off point. The evolution of the script was beautifully crafted: they lost, they wanted to revert things, but they failed again. They tried to move on, but were they able to? None of them was able to, ""not us"". As we see the heroes on their respective journey, each had an encounter that was heartbreaking: Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) looking at Peggy after so many years, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) talking to his father again, the Ancient One talking about Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) finding purpose for his Hulk transformation, and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) finally paying her debt to Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner). These events truly sum up the relationships and sacrifices our heroes went thru, and recapitulate their separate stories across the decade. And as these conclude, they funnel into one last battle, together, for an overdue reward we longed for.CHARACTERS: At this point after 21 movies, the actors ""are"" the characters.Tony Stark/Iron Man has finally fulfilled his legacy. His conclusion deserves the utmost respect and no denying I heard people sob in the theater. You can rest now Mr. Stark, your watch has ended.Steve Rogers/Captain America has finally yielded Mjölnir and unlocked his ultimate power, finally becoming worthy. The most satisfying scene was seeing him finally finding happiness. He has persistently put everyone first and now, 80+ years later, he got the dance he so longed for.Thor's depiction in this movie was conflicting. Though he remained lovable, we are not accustomed to him with such a physique. I do not deny I hoped that somewhere in the plot, he would be the ultimate version of himself as Tony, Steve, Natasha, and Clint were.Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow: Her love for Clint was sufficiently seen with their encounter. Her demise was aching, but heroic nonetheless. A true personification of friendship, affection, and sacrifice.Bruce Banner/Hulk: Since ""Thor: Ragnarok"", I have disliked the evolution of the Hulk. Though his depiction in Avengers 1 and 2 was that of a Professor, a man of Science, his character's development to an unconfident, ""cool"", and bossed around person is unsatisfying. Following Nat's death however, we slightly see a glimpse of the anger that once composed and fueled him.Clint Barton/Hawkeye is the human of the team. His drive was true and the pain hope adds to impossible situations was beautifully depicted in his journey.The role of Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) in this movie was acceptable. She did not seem overpowered and her distinction from the rest of team was correctly depicted. Nonetheless, as we look to the future, she brings no nostalgia to our original six.CONCLUSION:
In my review of ""Avengers: Infinity War"" almost exactly one year ago, I concluded stating: ""in Avengers 4, the Avengers must go back to their phase 1 roots and....Assemble."" As I contemplate the events of ""Endgame"", this small sentence, though simple, plain and not explicitly revealing, was a prophecy. The Avengers went back - literally -, each found their roots (Tony his father, Steve Peggy, Natasha Clint), and after this was achieved, Assembled.*** END of SPOILERS ***As the credits rolled, emotionally and spiritually, we bow down in respect to such a finale. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye: thank you for that decade of Marvel.",positive
"Russo Brothers and Writers you are amazing, The script was so so good that's why for 11 years i've been an MCU fan. This movie had everything and so much more, the humour was on point, the music was amazing. Marvel you did it again Thank you Kevin Feige and of cours thank you Stan",positive

"Avengers: Endgame is culmination of 22 movies which is something not many movie franchise can brag about but this also means that Endgame had a huge responsibility to carry on its shoulder. It had to bring closure to multiple character arc, ignite the fire for new ones to come and also deliver a coherent and meaningful story at the same time. There were a few snags but Russo brothers were mostly able to deliver on each of those expectation and gave us a cinematic extravaganza that will go down history as one of the most significant Hollywood event to take place in recent times.
This movie is a love letter to past 10 years of MCU from including multitude of past movie references to including its many type of signature humor, action scenes and shooting styles.
This movie had almost all the main cast from its previous 22 movies and each of one them gave their best in terms of acting especially the main avengers, this was one the best performance we have seen from Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Paul Rudd and Jeremy Renner . I liked some of the direction choices made by Russo brothers and disliked the others, In a movie populated with so many characters they were able to do the balancing act just right, the emotional scene had impact and the humor scene made me laugh and most (not all) main character got the screen time they needed. Iron-Man and Ant-Man are really the highlights they bring in a lot a humanising elements to the movie.By the end the director were able to tell a story with a satisfying end to many of the superheroes arc who have inspired young and adults alike for the past 10 years and gave way to new superheroes to inspire next generation of kids.
There are consequences of having such large scale movie and it showed like there were lot of character development that happened behind the camera -
Hulk and Bruce Banner were never comfortable in each other skin and this is a theme going on since Avengers 1 but now we jumped directly to the conclusion which I think will leave Hulk fans a little disappointed
A lot of panic and menace which may happen after half the population disappears was never shown through a civilian perspective which would have given a more emotional gravitas to the situation.
Captain Marvel's character felt like it was shoehorned in the movie. Her main reason was to save Stark but how she found him remains a mystery.
Thanos was a very sophisticated villain in Infinity War whereas here he was just another big bad arrogant villain.
Compared to Infinity War this movie lacked a sense of forward motion, after killing Thanos and retrieving all the stones the rest of the people and avengers were avenged, their job was done and plot complete. The final battle felt like it was there because movie was lacking a big action set piece.
The final battle was great because of the characters present in them, seeing all of them in action was a sight to behold but there was no sense of scale(just compare it to Wakanda battle from Infinity War).The cinematography was also good in parts like the Ant-Man scene where he was searching if his daughter was alive was well shot and the frantic camera movement showed his angst as well but then the Captain America vs Captain America fight scene was very poorly shot with so many cuts that it was hard to follow their fight, Otherwise the CGI and most of the scene looked very beautiful.
The soundtrack is probably the best one yet.
This movie had to deliver on a lot of promises and initially I felt that few cons could have been neglected when scale of the movie is this big but seeing how Infinity War released just a year ago did delivered on a lot of similar promises in a shorter run time, I think this is a good movie which definitely could have done better but ultimately what matters is that it was able to give satisfying end to an era of superhero which are an inspiration to younger generation.",positive
"Thor's dramatic entrance was so hilarious, but his drunken state will never define him as not ""worthy.""",positive
"For me, this movie has a lot plot hole. One example is Gamora can still back to live, even though she was scarified in Vormir.
But overall this movie is good, and must watch if you're superhero fan.",positive
"And not in a good way.This movie is one of the most ambitious movies to ever be made, that alone makes it a cinematic moment to be remembered, however this whole movie is eerily predictable. As you venture through the 3 hour flick, you are met with predictable plot points, very shallow and faux humor that tries to break tension, and a very lacking character growth from point A to point B. Sure, if you were to watch ALL of the 22 movies of the MCU you'd see the arch, but in this movie, especially in the main characters, we don't see a change during its run. Characters make decisions that dont really fit their personality and overall it just leaves the 3 hour venture shallow and dry. It is 2 and half hours of filler with really just two scenes of significance.That being said, the visuals are great, the score is better than most Marvel movies and this is a great wrap to a disappointing Phase 3 of the MCU series",positive
"I actually enjoyed Infinity War very much. The best part of that movie was the villain Thanos. He wasn't just another baddie. He clearly had a complex (and intelligent) character and the audience could associate with some of his ideas and philosophy. That interesting complexity and dialogue that he brought to the table was absent or minimal in this movie.This movie was disappointing because of:1) Thanos' portrayal2) Minor characters like Hawkeye given way too much screen time.3) Thor and Hulk never snapped back to their old great selves (was waiting for it but it didn't happen). I actually enjoyed fat Thor and found it funny but was disappointed we did not get to see classic Thor by the end, even for a moment.4) Captain Marvel clearly had too much power and could have almost single-handedly dealt with Thanos. It felt like the writers just gave the most paper thin excuse to keep her away.5) In Infinity War one actually felt sad when Spider Man perished in Iron Mans arms. I felt something deeply profound with the ending scene in Infinity War when Thanos could finally sit and rest to watch the sun set over the new universe he had created. The emotional scenes and deepness in this movie were just not at the same level.6) The time-travel and quantum physics scenes were confusing or at best not well explained (and I say that as someone with a PhD in Astrophysics!).7) The last fight scene seemed to be a (cheaper) copy of the Infinity War scene.Personally I would give Infinity War a 8.5 and Endgame around a 6. However, seeing how many people are (ridiculously, in my opinion) giving this a 10, to try restore some semblance of balance, I will give it a 1.",negative
"After the masterpiece that was infinity war, I did not think they could top it, I was very wrong. This film does everything right, from the action to the comedy, the emotion and above all, to the fan service. This is everything I could have hoped for from the movie and I will definitely be re-watching it. A true masterpiece",positive
The best for the last movie of this first 22 movies of the UCM ... THANKS MARVEL,positive
I can't express the feeling here it was the best movie i have ever seen ever. I cried so much i laugh so much i scream so much just. WOW,positive
"This movie is epic, ties everything up nicely and provides us with a sense of wonder and joy. If you loved these movies than you will love this one. It provides all we need to enjoy a movie.

When Captain American picked up Thor's hammer I got so excited I threw my hands up with excitement and accidentally punched the person sat next to me! But they were so excited to that we just carried on watching the film and screaming! If they read this I'm really sorry,positive
"Other than time traveling, everything else was reasonably good. Time traveling can never give clear answers, but only make more questions.",positive
"Well the Avengers series of the MCU left it all the screen in their Endgame. Despite a predictable end to the battle with Thanos, it brought a lot of great comedy and also a few tears. The movie didn't get of the best start, it picked itself up. It was interesting to see some of the blatant message in the climax, which threw me out of the movie for a second with an ""are you serious.""",positive
"Well after the previous avengers movie i really thought that this movie will be greater than old series but it disappointed meThe Idea to Destroy Stones and use time machine is ridiculousHalf of population of the world Dead and Heroes have joke conversation and make fun about time Travel and old movies about itAnt-man Eat food with happy face , Thor use Bear
i rather to see 25Min of War between thanos and Avengers in Green Planet instead of 3 hours of movie that seems write by kidsat the end Heroes must never Die or retired cause they are heroes and they give normal people like me HopeSo killing Iron-man or Retired Captain America is stupid idea
It Seems All Movies ( Matrix , Lord of Rings , ... ) had a weak end series and we must accept that",positive

"To be honest, I was not expecting the plot of the movie to be with time travel. The movie was great, but some parts were not explained properly and they just lumped it to just a ""quantum theory"". Overall, it appeased the masses, both Marvel and non-Marvel fans.",positive
"Sure the final fight with Thanos is more than epic, but I expected more than that. I wanted substance and a plot that didn't rely on ""quantum"" for all the questions and explanations.",positive
"The part where they were going back in time was boring and uninspired. The rest of the movie was good, especially the final fight.",positive
Godawful movie. Took itself too serious. The girlpower bit was groan out loud cringe. Fat thor pointless. Half a hulk just annoying. Ending was longer than lord of the rings. Big fight scenes awful cgi. Everything got thrown at the screen and none of it stuck,negative
"Honestly, it felt like it was too much of a set-up for me. Having Antman isolated in the Quantum realm was just too convenient and it felt like Marvel was just looking for a foundation for the script they had for this movie that wasn't even as good as the previous ones.",positive
"I've been watching the mcu for as long as i can remember, this feels like closing a chapter in my life.
Such a great finale, wasn't a moment when i didn't cry with sadness or joy",positive

Before I saw the movie, I heard nothing but how great the movie was. all the reviewers were so high that i thought it was the best movie in history. but actually the film was good enough and no more.

Marvell makes it all look so easy but when u look at other franchise you realise what they have created is nothing short of perfection.WarningIf you have younger kids who are invested in marvell just to let you know they will be a bit disturbed.. it took my 30 min to console my son.. he couldnt stop crying!!",positive

"Avengers endgame is the end of the infinity saga and it is the perfect ending. I may not be good with words but this movie was amazing! I am seeing it again tomorow for the 7th time! It is a little slow in the first hour, but it makes up for it because I am invested in these characters. I am happy with what they did with Thor and hulk because it makes sense in the context of their character ark. Thanos in this movie is not as good as he is in infinity war but that was the same with the heroes. Captain America for example was not very good in infinity war but now he is amazing in endgame. People like infinity war for the villain, and I think people should like endgame for the heroes. After all, these are superHERO movies!",positive
Avengers endgame was the best way to end the conclusion of the infinity saga to all 22 movies in the marvel cinematic universe when the journey started back in May 2 2008 I was excited and could not wait to see rest of the marvel movies with Stan Lee's cameos avengers endgame is my favorite movie of all time rdj is the best iron man and Chris Evans is the best captain America ever I will miss seen the six original avengers I love every story line in the marvel movies Rest In Peace tony stark I hope we remember you,positive
"Best movie ever made. There is like 70 hero's. The movie does have its flaws like every movie. Robert downey jr. Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffulo, Chris evens, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner all give outstanding performances. The other actors also did well. You will laugh, cry, cheer, clap, for this movie. Must watch",positive
"Avengers Endgame had a lot going for it: It serves as the conclusion to a 22-movie saga, it is the sequel to one of the most devastating MCU events (and a one year wait after it) and it must also serve as a satisfying conclusion to all the heroes we watched. The last time, the stakes were so complex, we got Age of Ultron... So we knew the result of too many complex plots in one offering.So the Russos had a huge thing going on this movie and boy do they exceed expectations as this is THE MOVIE we had been waiting for. Consider your expectations of some top moments you had in your head and this movie brings 3x the amount to it...This movie has it all... Emotion, Comedy, and boy oh boy, the Action. And best of all, an actual CONSEQUENCE OF ACTIONS. Infinity War's conclusion ain't a gimmick that is resolved. It has lasting consequences which I have expected given the same Russos handled Civil War and it's ramifications...This is THE MOVIE EVENT that changes you and I can safely would say to the future generations that man I lived during the MCU times and it was worth it. Being an Indian, I did not get the Star Wars phenomenon and now being a part of the MCU journey, I can understand the utter hype when you see the various people in the theatres with their Iron man and Cap's shirts.I'm glad to be part of this event and I'm going to be going more times...",positive
"This movie was enjoyable, which is why it got a decent rating, but with it's plot holes and multiple actors that don't really do what they could in the movie, just to lengthen the story it becomes rather dull even though it's enjoyable to watch.there is some comedy in there but it's mostly corny jokes, or bad writing.
not a big fan of the end fight, it had bad choreography, and thanos' weapon was incredibly terrible.",positive
"A culmination of 11 years of characters in one movie is hard to pull of yet pull it off well, combining incredible heart felt moments along with a surprising amount of funny ones too for a movie suffering from the dreadful consequences of the last, well worth the watch if at all a fan of marvel",positive
"Acting, CGI, quality is all great in this movie but I honestly expected a better script.The time travel was better handled than I feared but they still create at least 2 situations which they claimed themselves in the movie were to be avoided: cap stayed behind and must have changed the future considerably and Gomorrha was not returned to the past, so Quill could never meet her (?). Sloppy in my opinion. When they suggested bringing the stones back to when they took them this made sense to me (even though Banners/sorceresses explanation sucked. ""the stones are time?"" shouldn't matter if you take an infinity stone or a rock, you have to bring it back before anyone notices if you want to avoid changing timelines)Other things that annoyed me: I expected 3 hours of movie because they must have so much story to tell, but the beginning and the end were heavily padded with uninteresting stuff.
Everybody was kind of OP sometimes and then weak at other times because I guess this is a team and they did not want anyone stick out as unimportant or too powerful.The movie is too ""funny"". This was kind of supposed to be a desperate situation yet every scene had to end with a joke and often the jokes were not worth ruining the mood of the scene. We get it Thor is fat now, how absurd!
Which brings me to the next point: the emotional pulling. Apparently a lot of people like it but this movies can not make me cry. Especially because it's always pretty arbitrary who dies and not some inevitable cosmic destiny, so I feel just played by the movie makers. A good death should seem inevitable (They had to kill him to make this work!). None of the deaths in this movie worked this way. In fact they literally played with the viewer by making you guess who is gonna die. Tony sacrificing himself bringing back or saving Spider Man for example would have felt meaningful to me. They did not need to make the gauntlet kill somebody, they made it work this way because they wanted to kill Tony. It just disappoints me sometimes because it seems like movie making 101 to me.On top of that you get the normal comic book nonsense I guess you can not be mad about at this point: Tony figuring out time travel within an afternoon, Nonsensical tech and the fact that you literally need to snap your fingers to make the stones work (who designed that thing this way?), people with spears fighting space ships, space ships bombing an armored compound to rubble but literally missing every living person and the time machine van, Bucky looking like he's on a bender with his band shooting a dang old machine gun at armored super aliens...I also kind of disliked the smart hulk. The idea was okay but he was too silly. And for some reason the acting seemed off there, Ruffalo sounded like he was reading the lines sometimes.",positive
"I mean not sure why these films get rated so high! getting almost 9/10 for a film which is a 7/10 at best. Didn't even finish watching all the film, are we really saying this film is on par with LOTR, Inception etc..",negative

"This roller coaster ride was by far Marvel's best movie, yet. It may have best the best movie that I have ever seen in any genre. Looking at the list of movies I have seen, over 1000, I can't put my finger on one that provided the cohesive story and emotional ride that Avengers: Endgame provided.",positive
"The final act was amazing and in my honest opinion, one of the best stories in the MCU. Ten great years of storytelling, Thank you MARVEL!",positive
What a great ending to an epic saga! I knew from the start this was gonna be a tear-jerker and they sure didn't disappoint!,positive
"I really love how it felt like everyone who survived ""the snap"" felt that they lost somebody precious in their lives. It gives such a real sense of family.",positive
Felt like there was no room for creative expression. Everything that happened was expected. There was no real surprise. The addition of Captain Marvel just made things worse since it felt like it was forced to be there. Her character is too much and the actress playing her is boring. It looked like nobody on screen wanted to work with her and I can see why. The movie was good but I wanted more from it. It's worth seeing one time but maybe wait until the DVD.,positive

"I have waited some time to do a review on this title so that I could see the market response to the film in addition to having seen it the movie on its opening day. I am happy I let the dust settle on this so I could be level-handed in how I appraised this film. Overall, the film is 'good' but has significant problems throughout. It does not disappoint, I am sure (and given it has already made almost 2 billion globally at the time I write this review). Still, I caution those going into the film with HIGH expectations - like I did. For those that are very detail-oriented, I'd have to say... you'll be disappointed to some degree but will not consider the film a waste of time and money to see. I'll break it down with positives and negatives. The positives are many. First, there seems to be solid continuity between part 1 and part 2. I was happy to see this. I can envision putting these two films together and it would not miss a step or skip a beat. Second, the acting was, as expected, around the same quality we've come to expect from those that have a history of acting in the Avengers and Avengers-related franchises. The special effects, as always, were superb. Now, for the negatives. First, it seems that putting Captain Marvel in there is basically forced and uncomfortable. This character did not belong. Second, this piece does too much social justice warrior messaging. We have Captain America's shield going to Falcon? Since no super capabilities is a part of his physical build, how does he replace a super-human like Captain America? You have a string of female heroes in the battle scene that all the sudden find themselves 'together' to fend off Thanos and company while transporting the glove with the infinity stones. ""Oh, don't worry, we'll take it from here, fellas"". And some stupid message that is guiding Thor is to be who he is and not what he is supposed to be (these were words from his mother as well). So, he gives up his kingship to Valkyrie? What? Yes, Valkyrie, ""you'll be a good queen."" And, lastly, holy smokes, this whole dimension of time aspects where you can go back and make changes with no consequences just cannot seem to be logically dealt with in any way. If it was true, why would the stones need to be returned? If it is false, then so many decisions change and likely problems result from the time rifts. In either case, the storyline was poorly written on this aspect and destroys the underlining mission right on up to wonderboy, Captain America, who did not move on from his old flame, staying with her after returning the stones to their original places (thereby interfering with a husband-to-be and children that she had). Irresponsible to significant degree that morally cannot be justified. And let's not even discuss how all these humans are able to hold infinity stones now, okay? The rest, see for yourself. Yes, it is worth seeing but if you try to make sense of it, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Still worth some good, nonsensical fun.",positive
"Some parts were done well, revisiting the previous films was a treat but the film overall was pretty lousy. Cap and Tony's departure were not well executed. There are several reviews already on why Cap's exit was out of character and unlikely, look them up if you don't see it. Tony, always wrong, sacrifices himself finally after a lifetime of selfishness, which is a heroic exit in a way, but was a pretty lame ending for such an important character. The movie relies HEAVILY on trying to pull viewer's heartstrings vice have decent writing and make sense in many ways. The SJW nonsense has been out of control in these movies as well for sometime now, more prevalent in the agents of shield series though tbh. Time for Disney to let it go.",negative

"(No Spoilers) I came into this film after an epic 10 years of just incredible storytelling and didn't know what to expect as this film didn't reveal literally anything in the trailers. Thank god it didn't because my jaw was dropping throughout the film.Directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, the duo direct the satisfying, amazing and mind blowing end to the 22 films in Marvels story arch they've been developing over the past decade.The first act feels a little slow but it's to develop the characters to where they are now and it's not boring at all. In my opinion anyway. With characters we've been caring about since day one, each character has their moment to shine. And that final act - without spoiling... holy moly. My eyes couldn't believe what they were seeing.As a filmmaker: directing was incredible (because it's the Russo brothers). The writing was also amazing with great dialogue moments and sometimes the dialogue means something later on in the film. The cinematography was also amazing, Trent Opaloch didn't utilize the shaky-cam too much, which is great to understand the geography for the fight sequences. The music and editing was also great. The acting though in this film is phenomenal that's all I'll say because if I start giving examples we go into spoilers.Overall: 10/10. Best. Superhero. Film. To. Date.Also, thanks Kevin Feige for making this a 3hr epic. Thank you! For the past 10 years and more to go!",positive
Wow wow wow what a emotional rollercoaster of a movie. Oscar material if I ever so one.,positive
"And my what a finale it is!
Easily the best MCU movie out there and while you probably need to be a fan and watched all the previous 21 movies in the series to appreciate and understand everything, it will still be a good movie to the casual viewers. Filled with big moments from start to end, watching the characters break down, reunite, grow, and finally say goodbye is an emotional rollercoaster, that will move anyone. To a fan who has seen all the movies in the series these emotions will naturally be 10-fold stronger.
You may think you're ready for this, but you're not.",positive
"Do two wrongs make a right? Well, the makers of this film and Marvel studios appear to think so. After realising the folly of one blockbuster, the correction is attempted by doing another.Avenger: Infinity War and its sequel Endgame, are said to have been made 'back to back' and that means it's not an accident in film making. For those who have NOT seen Infinity, it is made clear in the initial sequences of Endgame that 'half of the life across the universe' had recently been disintegrated by Thanos (played convincingly by Josh Brolin ) and his men, using the power gained from the Infinity Stones ( Time, Mind, Space, Power, Soul and Reality).Tony Stark (Iron Man, played wearily by Robert Browney Jr.) and Nebula (Thanos's step daughter, played passionately by Karen Gilan) fighting the war are saved narrowly from verge of death by Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel played by a marble faced Brie Larson). Steve Rogers (Captain America, played by an unsure Chris Evans), Natasha (Black Widow, played by an emotional Scarlett Johansson) and Nebula fail to entice Stark (who prefers a retired life with his family) to get into action in order to retrieve the stones, and the world. But they manage to recruit Bruce Banner (Hulk played by a committed Mark Ruffalo), Thor (played by a beer-bellied Chris Helmsworth, coz his character now drinks a lot of beer) and James Rhodes (War Machine, played by a straight forward Don Cheadle) and together they go in search of Thanos to retrieve the Stones. Thanos declares that he has destroyed the stones soon after they served the purpose of destruction. Was Thanos lying? No. (Nebula: my dad may be whatever, a liar he is not). In a fit of rage, Thanos' head is chopped off by Thor.When everything seems lost, Scott Lang (Ant-Man played comically by Paul Rudd ) arrives on the scene - just recovered from a time warp that he underwent - for him the past five years he spent in the quantum realm seemed like just five hours. So it's hypothesised that if you could somehow get into the warp, you can reach different points in time in the past, in order to reverse or avert the damages done at that time and return to the present. (Obviously, a concoction of Max Planck and Albert Einstein there, for novices in physics.) Stark joins the team, and together they make the time station (after a few failed comical attempts). They rope in all the remaining Marvel heroes for the big act. The plan is set: the team must get hold of the stones from their original sources, before Thanos 'had' laid hands on them, and eventually must protect the world from the devastation that anyway did not take place!The rest of the movie is all about bringing the plan into action: and the action must've brought some fun, especially for the kids. In the end, just one billion $ box office question remains: In the time warp created by Marvel's movie makers, had the Endgame been made first, would there have been a need for the first (Infinity War)? No? And in that case, would there have a need for the second? That would have a happier ending....",positive
"This movie was EPIC!!! Seriously, Marvel could not have brought phase 3 to a close any better. I have never been one to cry at movies but this one had me in tears at different points.

Very excited to see what phase 4 has in store. Cheers Marvel!",positive
"Decent movie for teenagers. This film is just deserved at least like 6 or 7 on imdb and somehow it reached more than 8. The first 2 and half an hour is just too long for only time traveling, it's boring and the fight scene, wth is wrong with thor? They throw a bunch of superheroes in the last scene but all i see is a huge mess, this is the worst fight scene i have ever watched. Overall this movie is just bland, overused cgi which indeed is the feast to the eyes but that doesn't make the story better. And btw time traveling and why it has to be time traveling. This must be the end of mcu",positive

"Let me start that End Game held up on most of my expectations for following the mess that Thanos created with he snapped half of the universe out of existence. And I was right to assume that time travel would be the way they reverse what Thanos did. I will say I have more likes than dislikes for the movie. What I loved about End Game can even begin to list them but I have to say my favorite moment in the movie is when Steve Rogers took control of Mjolnir and delivered a beat down on Thanos to the point I thought he would be the one to defeat him but I'm glad he didn't do it by himself because what happened next blew my mind when all the vanished Avengers and their allies returned for the final clash, that fight was EPIC. Another thing I liked was Valkyrie's return I loved her in Ragnarok and I was relieved to see Peter Parker back as his death in Infinity War hit me hard. Now the one thing I did not like about End Game though it was enjoyable was how the treated Thor after they failed to get the stones from Thanos at the beginning. He became a beer gut joke and though they convinced him to get back in to the fight I was expecting by the final fight to get back his short hair look and be the Thor we remembered, though he was not disappointing in the final fight I was expecting him to be back to normal by the end of the movie. Overall the movie was very enjoyable and a perfect closing to what I call the Infinity Stone Saga. Can't wait to see what's next for the MCU as terms of the aftermath of End Game.",positive

I think that's the word because I don't have any word for describing it, it can't be described in a single word

"He is without doubt the baddest villain we've seen, the power of the man and this is even without the infinity stones, he damn near Physically beat nearly everyone to death! He's scenes made sense with the cut scenes we've seen in earlier films.I liked this movie lots, there are some slow bit that drag on but I would say the last 50 minutes is on smoke! Like Infinity war it picks up the pace with its intensity! And again Thanos is a badass!There was a shock death in it for me which was unexpected and not the main one which was what everyone was talking about before the release, and that got me!As fan of both Marvel and DC I'm quite lucky to live in a time where the comics I use to read as child in the 80s I get to watch in truly magnificent form!Roll on summer roll on Godzilla!",positive

I'm pretty sure we're not even close to seeing everything from the Marvel Universe so I am excited to see what's next. Just as every Marvel movie, it had amazing actors and actresses. Truly wonderful.",positive
"Endgame fell short of being the fantastic end that everyone wanted it to be. It had a really slow first third and just when it got going the writers cram some sour brie cheese down the audience's throat, jarring the audience off the edge of their seats. In a repetitive pattern the main characters are constantly thrust situations of peril to be ""saved"" by the timely annoyed arrival of brie cheese.
As for the rest of the cast this movie was great well preformed and exactly what you want in a marvel movie up until the next serving of brie cheese.",positive
"Honestly I cannot believe how many fanboys are calling this perfection.My review is unpopular but I'm sure many will agree.1. Fat Thor is pathetic, why ruin the strongest coolest of them and turn him into Lebowski ?2. Hulk..... What do I say.... So much Hulk screentime yet sooo disappointing.
Geek, soft and calm Hulk ! Seriously !!!!3. So much time waisted on time travelling, omg the first 1.5 hours was just a bore.4. Captain Marvel was just pointless, why even bother introducing her at the 11th hour ?5. Cap America all of a sudden uses Thor's hammer, come on !!!!6. Beating Thanos was just too easy, too quick too easy.7. Only Nat and Stark die, it's Thanos what the hell !!!Anyways if the rest loved it good for them, but 7 disappointments at 3am without thinking too hard, it's 3 out of 10 from me.If you're wondering the first half was a 10 from me.",negative
This is like everything you wanted in marvel movie and more. It ends in a satisfying conclusion like when Tony Stark snaps his fingers and dies and where Captain America goes back in time and gives his shield to falcon. This makes me want to know what's going to happen next. But there are a couple nitpicks from there to there like the pacing in the first act but they do it purposely to set up these characters for the rest of the movie. If you are talking by a action standpoint infinity war is the better movie or if you are talking by a emotional and story level then endgame is better. But yeah I really don't know where there going to go next,positive
This movies ensemble is one of the biggest I've ever seen in a movie. The movie flowed really well 1 hr tied up everything from infinity wars And every hr after that there was the solution (with a few laughs) and last but not least that last hr the epic finale - avenger... assemble!! A unique experience and the way I put it - it chronologically started with captain America the first avenger in the 1940's and endgame finished with that same 1940's last dance - brilliant!,positive
Here's why i think this movie has a bad script but with a great ending:BAD SCRIPT: The timeline topic is a very delicate one and in Endgame this topic is not well scripted. When they're looking for the Stone of Power in 2014 Nebula (Past) noticed that there's something going on and she brings Thanos (2014) to the actual time (2024) wich means that from 2014 to 2024 there's no Thanos. Which means that what happened in 2018 (Infinity War) did not happened due to there's no Thanos in that time because got killed in 2024.The Timeline topic is a delicate one and they did not handle it well.,positive
"It has to be the end, being a marvel fan we all know what a beautiful memory it will be. Iron Man will be in our hearts forever.",positive
"Perhaps one of the best, even the best movie I have ever seen!",positive
"While Endgame is not necessary the greatest movie ever, what it accomplishes Is arguably the greatest feat ever pulled in film. To take the plots from 21 different movies and combine them into one three hour slot in a way that makes sense is incredible. Almost every single hero from the movies, no matter how minor, is included, and Marvel somehow manages to further develop the characters of almost every hero, which, again, is a mammoth feat for a three hour film. There is a clear path each character was on since the cinematic universe began, and they stay on their path through the end of this movie.As far as this movie by itself goes, it has the typical humor of a Marvel movie that may not please everyone, but it is not reliant on that humor and certainly has stretches where it allows tension to build without any comic relief. While some people may be displeased about the use of time travel in this film, it is much better than the easier alternative, which would have essentially been another battle with Thanos for the movie, resulting in little character development. Through the time travel, characters can explore their past and continue to develop through meaningful interactions with their past selves. For those people who dislike how un-scientific time travel seems, this is a super hero movie, not a documentary. It isn't supposed to be based on science. After they arrive back to the present, the battle scene begins. As all of the resurrected heroes arrive at the scene, viewers will get goosebumps. There is no better way Marvel could have demonstrated what they accomplished than having everyone together at once, battling evil. It is truly one of the most awe-inspiring scenes in film history.
There was only one real issue with the movie, which happens when all of the female heroes teamed up to protect the Infinity Stones. While this obviously carries a good message, it feels much too forced and comes across as an effort for political correctness rather than actually sending a message. The abilities of all the female superheroes on their own already carry that message in a much more natural way.
Overall, it is best to just step back and look at what Marvel has accomplished over the last 10+ years, and how they managed to pulpit off successfully. Just look at what DC is trying to do with its own universe right now to see how this can all go so wrong very easily. Marvel has managed to create a universe larger than any other film series ever (including Star Wars), filled with twists and turns and built to continue in the future (there are, after all, thousands of superheroes in this universe). While it certainly is not in the taste of film critics, this movie deserves to win awards because there will not be another film for a very long time that tells a story anywhere near the magnitude that this one does.",positive
"I consider myself a marvel fan and I remember the day I went to see this movie, maybe I was just so excited before walking into a movie theater when I went to see infinity war.The movie started very slow even for me, despite that I feel that the narrative flows well but there comes a time when you go 2 hours into the movie and it is just that the battle begins and when you see that like that, you can understand that the narrative tires some people.I think my problem with this movie is the details like the rhythm, politically unnecessary and pointless scenes, Captain Marvel being the least bearable character in the MCU and probably the most stupid and mediocre deus ex machina in the history of cinema (a rat, a stupid rat).It is inferior to infinity war it is many aspects and unfortunately it is not what I expected to see in the cinema and as much as I want those final 30 minutes of action with CGI it does not make up for almost 3 hours of a movie that had a lot to give and it remains for me Halfway.",positive

"As a casual fan of the MCU (watched most movies, read no comics) it didn't have such an impact on me but it was an enjoyable ride all the same. I was worried at the beginning that the three hours would drag (some scenes were padded, shall we say) but it was no difficulty. Though there was surprisingly little action, it kept my attention throughout. I did find myself getting lost occasionally with all the references to previous movies that I simply couldn't remember well enough.A scene I found particularly effective was the opening with Hawkeye's family. I thought it did well to remind us where we left off without retreading the same ground as before.I found one plot point particularly confusing. I thought Thanos had to sacrifice the thing most dear to him who was coincidentally beside him in the previous movie yet here it seemed like the soul stone just requires whoever happens to be standing next to you. I've got to say the image of the dead body was my favourite though, absolutely stunning.As for humour, some felt misplaced and fell flat but there were a few hilarious moments for sure. Thor is essentially comic relief which may not please some but I enjoyed almost all of his scenes. I just think Chris Hemsworth is such a pro at his delivery.Overall it was a tremendous effort to try to wrap up so many stories in a satisfying way. For most I imagine it will be successful, I just felt it tied too neat a bow on everything. I've got to say I wanted a higher body count, further showing my morbid taste. I had no significant attachment to the characters so my eyes remained completely dry as we progressed through the farewells which rival LOTR for length if not emotion. It was still a very enjoyable ride. I would say Infinity War was more thrilling but Endgame was more polished. Definitely worth a watch.",positive
"Just watched this in fast-forward.
i simply cannot digest this universe where in one hand high tech space travel magic creatures are living along with dump low tech planetlings , so i guess that the majority of the fans are identifying them self to those lowlifes. and the most irritating for me is how low modern they dress them self in this marvel universe.",negative
"The build up to the grand finale of this 22 film long story arc is slow, and is part of the reason that the 3 hour runtime is a thing. However the runtime proves useful for the story because if they had just done the first 2 hours in a matter of minutes, the film would feel as if it was rushed and possibly could've ruined it. That being said I feel like it could've had a bit more excitement than what it had but the story got a pass because the characters got the exposition and closure with other characters that they needed and that couldn't have been excused with the runtime under 3 hours long.One of my favorite parts in the film was the fight between Hawkeye/ Ronin vs Black Widow where they were fighting over who would sacrifice themselves so the other would get the Soul Stone. Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson played their parts to a T and it provided one of the most emotional parts in the film.The last hour was probably my favorite in the MCU by far. The fact that we finally see Cap lift Mjilnoir and use it to the best of his ability plus using his shield to take on the Mad Titan one on one was amazing. Tony's sacrifice in the end was one of the saddest moments in cinema I've seen, especially since I've grown up with the MCU and got to see the end having watched the vast majority of the Infinity Saga. The closings of all our favorite characters was pure and blissful emotion that mad me sad to see it ending, but happy that the ends were what we as fans and them as characters both deserved.After the masterpiece that was Endgame, I am very much excited for the next story arc of the MCU and hope that it is even better than the Infinity Saga.",positive
"I just love this movie. Specially the climax, seriously one of the best climax I have ever seen.",positive
"Wow, that's the word I want to start with so there will be no confusion about this movie. It's almost brilliant, to get us hyped for a movie after years of building and to deliver. Amazing. The perfect mix of humor, drama, action and suspense, the perfect cast and the brilliant story writing makes this movie the best of all the superhero movies ever made. And it was enough for now.
I came to love all the characters and even the less popular ones got great respect. It was a Rollercoaster ride, a thrill with a family like saus that made this 36 Yr old guy cry like a 12 Yr old kid. There was one moment of criticism for me personally and that was the political correct women are strong message that this movie did not need. Not one moment I had the feeling that women or men where more or less important and needed a moral boost but even That didn't ruin the moment and man, that moment was glorious.",positive
"It has a little time traveling issues but it's a really good close-up for the last 10 years I love that some of them died they couldn't all be a life like in some fairy tale, it's funny when it needs to
It has some plot issues they're so little and a few but still takes 1-2 stars out",positive
"First of all, I have to agree on the comments that first half of this movie is really slow. There is only 10 minutes of action throughout entire 1,5 hours. However, it doesn't bore you, instead it helps you focus on characters and their feelings after they lost their friends and families because of Thanos.Remaining Avengers members try to figure out a way to undo what Thanos did. Although most of us guessed what they were gonna do, the way they do it has a lot more to offer than you can imagine. That's where things starts to refer to almost every previous Marvel movies. It makes you laugh, surprise and cry.You don't have to be a pure Marvel fan to enjoy it. Don't want to spoil it, just go and see it.",positive
Some people here complaining about Thor are probably women who wanted to see him shirtless. You probably didn't understand the movie or how Thor felt. He is miserable because he FAILED to kill Thanos the first time!As for my review. I was overwhelmed the whole time. I felt like I was with the one who vanished from the universe and felt so satisfied and devastated to end Thanos. I am beyond grateful for the MCU for giving us this quality of work to perfection!,positive
"This is the greatest MCU movie ever done,and even if there are some mistakes on the development of the plot,I loved this movie because it gives a beautiful conclusion to the MCU.
Russo' bros did a great job,because they managed to develop a lot of different characters in a movie without being banal.
Personally I didn't appreciate fat thor and a bit hulk,but I understand that they have done that to evolve those characters.",positive
"Considered as the Finale or the final chapters of the Avenger Series, it is the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is the only film of this century that has garnered such a Huge demand in domestic as well as International Markets. Fans, especially the kids and teenagers are awaiting its release with baited breathe and fortunately I was able to watch the movie couple of days earlier than the International Release.The Movie is 3 hours long but believe me it is too short to cover such as vast ensemble cast and package all their stories into it within the stipulated time. I believe that the movie should have been made into two parts. Why I feel this way? Let me explain it to you. There are certain parts of the movie where you feel they are trying to build up the story and later you realize that they just dragged it and there are other scenes in the movie where you feel it is being done hastily before we the audience could sink in the gravity of the scene or the moments resulting the emotional scenes as bland. Now why would they even consider building up the story as Avengers Infinity Wars had already set the stage for the Finale? Everyone who has watched the prequel to Endgame only wants to know how these Heroes will make things right and how emotionally they have been affected.If they had made it in two parts then every character would have shined like in Infinity War but here even the main characters fail to make an impact. There are jokes here and there but they aren't enough. There are too many unnecessary, silly scenes that only consume time and nothing else. I believe after watching the Endgame, every fan will agree that Infinity Wars is the best movie of the Franchise. If you recall Captain America - Civilian War then it reminds you of the brilliant action choreography because most of it is done in the daylight as against the dark creepy VFX settings like most of the other Superhero flicks. Even the Infinity War triumphs in the Grand Battle because everything was done in daylight. Those scenes looks real compared to the dark graphics. I was Very disappointed with the Finale 8 -10 mins of Grand Battle of Endgame, it was similar to Aquaman.My opinion may sound bit negative but its not, you will definitely enjoy the movie and there are some good moments including is a moment where you may get heartbroken, I mean literally if you are a Marvel Fan. It is one of the most heartbreaking emotional scenes ever in a Superhero Flick because of its impact. Go watch it and enjoy but go with lower expectations so that you can enjoy more.-FS",positive
"I will say this movie is epic. With so many cameos and great CGI, as expected from Marvel. The actors and actress are great (shout out to Robert Downey Jr.) though sometimes the lines is not so great . Some of the lines will bring you emotions (mainly related to family interactions like Tony Stark with Morgan, Pepper and Peter Parker, Thor and Frigga, Morgan and Happy). Lines for Hulk/Bruce Banner is delightful, did not expect that.What irks me the most is about the plot and character development. The time heist is quite messy, so many plot holes (maybe they don't really care about continuity error?). What happened to tesseract stole by Loki? Does it have no consequences? What happened that to Steve (and mjolnir)? Did Steve let all the evil happened just like that after he decided to stay in past therefore he is not worthy of mjolnir?Just some warning for those who bring their children, Thor is quite violent in early part of the movie (there's a scene where Thor decapitate Thanos). After that Thor is depicted as some lazy, layabout drunkard who cannot move on from his failure after Thanos snapped his fingers.All in all if you are a casual fan, probably you will enjoy the movie. But if really concerned about the plot and character, the ending kinda ruin the whole movie for you.",positive
"Infinity War excelled through pacing, structure, suspense, brutality and well-crafted villains. Marvel films tend to be mediocre 'watchable' flicks, so it was a huge shock to see an entry so significantly above the others.Endgame threw all that aside, and stamped on it. The pacing is all over the place, the structure feels like 50 writers tried to shove in different segments, with one editor desperately trying to piece it all together into some form of narrative which made an acceptable level of sense, sort of, kinda...The great Thanos is now a pointless character who's done his job and doesn't care anymore, so pointless in fact, they have to go back to the past to find one who does. Neither him nor his guards are in any way intimidating this time round, we've seen it all before as they'd already won. Why are they fighting again? They won! It's like cheating in a game if things don't quite go your preferred way, so you keep replaying segments until the outcome is satisfying for you. Story telling at its very worst.Time travel made the whole thing feel cheap, rehashed and undeserved. Who cares about the soul stone sacrifice? We've seen it before, get on with one of you dying. Why get excited for the final battle? (with no build up or suspense, the characters just suddenly appear), we've seen it before - they lost. I've absolutely no idea why Captain Marvel was in the film - possibly the most awkwardly written-in character ever. Did Tony Stark really need to sacrifice himself? The battle was well in their hands by that point! Just stall the big purple thing which is somehow destroying everyone without the stones.So why the high rating? Well nostalgia, 11 years of build up and fan service is enough to make the majority look the other way. I'm sure the studio know this was a messy effort, and can't believe they've got away with it.",negative
"It has everything you need. The perfect ending.It's now one of my most favorite movies.Beautiful special effects, a very interesting story with very good acting by all the actors.The only negative is who will be the next Captain America and I am sure Brothers Rousso could with their talent could change the ending and make it even cooler.",positive

"This movie is what it was meant to be. It is not an easy choice, to make a 3 hours movie. The material has to be good for the intended audience, otherwise the movie becomes trash. This movie will go up there with Titanic and The godfather part II as movies that fulfill their objectives to the point of perfection and how long it takes to do so.
To more hardcore MCU fans like myself, a warning: Be ready to cry.After Captain Marvel many (Including myself) started to question the decision to make that movie and bring that character so late on. They made it work.Time fly while watching this movie. Have a good time!",positive
"I expected a genre super-hero movie as a final chapter of MCU saga like the Avengers, but we got a melo-drama crossover with so many PC messages that make headache watching it. And it was just because of the last 10 or 15 minutes! Until that time it was great, but a wrong ending can ruin everything...The death of the given superhero was completely frustrating because of his family status. A happy-end would have been better after 10 years. It is not a shakespearean melo-drama! Poor little child after the death of her father she had to watch his farewell video (I guess it would give a life time work for a psychologist later). Then the mourning scenes... It was just long, boring and lame (lot of cheeseburgers can replace daddy, sure). A producer wanted some screen play time. The mysterious boy was completely out of space.Hulk's character was also ruined completely by the end of the movie and saga. One of the strongest super-hero was not able to come out of a collapsed building. Ant-man did it, lol. Hulk had not smashed anything during infinity wars (some people believed because he is Loki), but most surprising in Endgame neither. In Avengers he was able to smash a chitauri leviathan with a single punch. Here... it was bad, bad, bad.Infinity war represented all the heroes much better in the fight scenes, here Dr. Strange did almost nothing. Saved the chituari army from water. And Hulk absolutely nothing.And the cherry on the top was the overused PC. Instead of Hulk we got an iron lady...then a super-heroine squad. That scene was so, so, soooo forced. Then Cap. America gave his shield not to his best friend, who is also a super-soldier, but his 2nd best friend, who is just a normal man with some gadgets. Very clever and strange... but yes, we know the reason: PC rules.",positive
"Literally didn't know what to say when I left the cinema......
What is there to say? 3hours of my life I'd like back again.......... Over and over again........ Watching the film over and over again........
The main battle scene had me struggling to catch everything! It was incredible! Anyone can find something to be critical about in any movie........ but if your are looking for something to be critical about your aren't doing what you should be...... watching the damn movie and loving the spectacle of it all! If the film had been an hour longer I would not be complaining! I'm not going to give any spoilers because I want everyone to enjoy it as much as I did. I'm going to see it again and I'll be getting it on dvd and watching it again, and again, and again........
Happy, sad, happy, amazed shocked, surprised, happy, emotional....... Just a roller-coaster I wanted to get straight back on! They have tied up the character arcs that they needed to so well and treated the characters, and the fans, with total respect!",positive
Absolutely amazing the whole 3 hours was worth to spend and ending was exceeded my expectations. thank you so much for not spoiling the ending and thank you so much for making it the best ending ever thank you MARVEL,positive
"I was not impressed.
Save your money and time.
Wait till they show this in Netflix
John Wick 3 should have been in this film and story line could have been way better!",negative
"This movie as an absolute masterpiece. I saw some reviews that are concerned with filling plotholes such as how (SPOILERS) Steve Rogers was able to go back in time and live a normal life, but it is clear in the movie that he had a pym particle that he used to go back, and quantum physics explains the rest of it. (Spoilers over) Also the sfx makeup is really good, so if you're into that, watch the movie and just sit and admire it.",positive
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, the result of years of work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie with a dozen subplots colliding, and familiar faces from over 20 other movies. It's really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration. The blunt thing you probably want to know most: It's hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed. It checks all the boxes, even ticking off a few ones that fans won't expect to be on the list. It's a satisfying end to a chapter of blockbuster history that will be hard to top for pure spectacle. In terms of sheer entertainment value, it's on the higher end of the MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few legitimate thrills along the way
Don't worry: I will stay very spoiler-free. The main joy of this film is in how its incredibly complex narrative unfolds, and you can go elsewhere if you want that ruined. The disappointing ""Avengers: Infinity War"" ended with Thanos finally getting all of the six Infinity Stones he so desperately sought, and then using them to wipe out half of existence, including beloved heroes like Black Panther, Star-Lord, and Spider-Man. ""Avengers: Endgame"" picks up a few weeks after ""The Snap,"" as the remaining heroes try to pick up the pieces and figure out if there's a way to reverse Thanos' destruction.Immediately, ""Endgame"" is a more focused piece than ""Infinity War"" by virtue of having a tighter, smaller cast. (Thanks, Thanos.) It's a more patient, focused film, even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies. Whereas ""Infinity"" often felt bloated, ""Endgame"" allows some of the more iconic characters in the history of the MCU a chance to be, well, heroic. No longer mere pawns in a Thanos-driven plot, Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, and Thor break free of the crowd, ably assisted by Hawkeye and Ant-Man. In a sense, this is the new Avengers, and the tighter group of superheroes reminded me of the charm of Joss Whedon's first ""Avengers"" movie, one in which strong personalities were allowed to bounce off each other instead of just feeling like they were strapped into a rollercoaster headed in the same direction. It also allows space for some of the best acting work in the franchise, particularly from Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr., who one realizes while watching this have turned Captain America and Iron Man into something larger than life for a generation. The most satisfying aspect of ""Endgame"" is in how much it provides the MCU's two most popular heroes the story arc they deserve instead of just drowning them in a sea of cameos by lesser characters from other movies. In the way it canonizes them, it becomes an ode to the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.What works best about Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's script for ""Endgame"" is that one feels, for arguably the first time, a sense of looking back instead of merely trying to set the table for something to come. This film incorporates elements of what fans know and love about the MCU, recalling character beats, origins, and the plots of movies like ""Iron Man,"" ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger."" Call it cheap fan service, but one of my biggest issues with these films, especially ""Infinity War,"" has been a sense that they're merely commercials for movies yet to be made. ""Endgame"" doesn't have that. Sure, the MCU will go on, but this movie has a finality and depth given to it by MCU history that the others have lacked.Of course, it needs to work as just a movie too. The middle hour is as purely enjoyable as the MCU has ever been, but there are times when I wished I could sense a human touch below the incredibly-polished, carefully-planned surface of ""Avengers: Endgame."" In the long build-up first hour, I longed for one of the pregnant pauses about the seriousness of the situation to lead to something that felt spontaneous or an acting decision that didn't feel like it had been run through a committee. Every single aspect of ""Endgame"" has been foreshadowed for years by other films and finely tuned by the hundreds of people it takes to make a movie like this one. The result is a film that often feels more like a product than a piece of art. Roger Ebert once famously wrote that ""video games can never be art,"" but he may have been surprised to see art becoming more like a video game, something remarkably programmed and determined, lacking anything that really challenges the viewer.However, people aren't lining up at dawn for ""Avengers: Endgame"" to challenge them. It's really about rewarding commitment, fandom, and expectations. Whatever its flaws, ""Endgame"" does all of that, and with a sincere admiration for the fans who have made this universe a true cultural phenomenon. The stakes are high and the conclusions actually feel resonant. It's an epic cultural event, the kind of thing that transcends traditional film criticism to become a shared experience with fans around the world. The biggest question I had coming out was how they could possibly top it ten years from now.",positive
My son and I watched and and loved every second of it. Marvel did a fantastic job honoring it's characters and fans. This is definitely the best super hero movie ever made. Warning: you might need to bring tissues to Endgame.,positive
"The movie kept me excited and entertained for the whole 3 hours. There was not a moment of me taking my focus of the movie, and that's what good movies do.",positive
"Paradox's paradox's paradox's. My main question is, if captain America went back in time to be with his woman, what happened to the captain America that was already there in that time? Did future Steve Rogers kill of past Steve Rogers? And if Captain America wasn't around then how could everything in civil war and the winter soldier have happened? Anyway I enjoyed the movie but wasn't anywhere near as good as infinity war.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame:- A year after half the characters disappeared, we created our own endless theories and possibilities of killing Thanos. Nothing said so far, the movie turns out to be a good explanation as to how situations could change in just maybe a single possible way. This doesn't mean that the script made predictable. Well, some of it is, but the Russo brothers manages to engage the audience with awe and curiosity. This is a 3 hour long movie which has tons of emotional and heart warming scenes where the characters beautifully express their softness. Also the thought expressed while scripting these scenes is quite admirable. At some points the scenes are a little bit dragged but that's just for the viewers to enjoy their favorite character in this final project. The concepts do contradict at times and can get a little confusing. The concepts cannot be elaborated as they can be a major spoiler. A few moments in the movie were just breathtakingly awesome as it was totally unexpected. The actors have delivered their best performance in all aspects by connecting to it's viewers throughout. The MCU couldn't get a better ending to justify the events in this movie which makes it just spectacular. Experiencing and reliving what we have witnessed till today in all the Marvel movies was the main objective of the makers and they did a commendable work. It's not quite comparable, but if done in terms of entertainment, then yes, infinity war is ahead of all in this game. Nevertheless, enter the theater with all your assumptions and let's see how well you have done.
Rating: 8/10",positive
"The Endgame is not like the previous instalments, first, it is too long, also it is boring in some parts... Too slow like drama movies,The theme of the movies is dark(like DC movies) which doesn't appealing in 3D.Some action is good, worth to watch.If you are a die-hard fan of Marvel movies then go for it.",positive
I watched this the first day amazing movie RIP Tony Stark,positive
"This movie offers many compelling moments - whether fun, breathtaking, tear-jerking, or thought-provoking. Yet it doesn't offer a strong narrative that pulls them together into one coherent movie. The first and second acts are wildly disharmonious with each other, and while the confrontation of the third act is satisfyingly epic, it doesn't quite erase the fact that the key in the lock of the conflict's solution still feels a bit like cheating, even though the writers have tried to make it airtight. This is a movie about nostalgia more than anything, and thus offers many sentimental nods to fans. If you're a fan who's more into sentiment than narrative, then you'll probably find this movie quite satisfying. However, after the masterful satisfying. However, after the masterful ""inevitability"" of its prequel's storyline, the somewhat chaotic and random tone of this movie's narrative feels like a letdown to me.",positive

"All the emotion, action and humour packed into one!! if you love action movies, then this is for you. The start was slow when we saw how they went 5 years after the events of Infinity War, it was depressing but hey, Asgard is back, but then they bring time travel after Ant-Man comes back from the quantum realm but that was a nice start, but then all the action comes up from there, Tony and the rest on the ship is rescued which is amazing, but the final battle, oh boy, SO DAMN AMAZING!!! And that's not it, Captain America has Thor's hammer, holy crap, but now to the sad part. Black Widow is dead, Tony Stark is dead, which death made you cry the most. GOODBYE STAN!!!",positive

"Endgame is one of those movies that comes out once a decade. It is a must see movie but if you are new to the MCU then you might want to catch up before attending this movie. Otherwise it won't be worth the ticket to see this movie because you won't understand any of it. At the same time the visual effects and master cinematography is worth the watch even if you don't understand anything that is happening. That is why I am giving it a 8/10 because the story is good but there are many other stories within the MCU itself. Overall, it was a solid movie that appeals to fans but if you aren't a fan who has seen all the other movies there might be parts that will be lost on you.",positive
"It's worth watching but it didn't live up to the hype.The stage was already set in Infinity War, all that was needed was to follow through and keep the rhythm going but the pace was slow at first and then it felt rushed at the end.I know, right, a 3 hour movie should have figured this out before the final cut.Too many characters to give screen time, I understand but when did Hawkeye become that of an interesting figure?More people should have died and too many characters are left in limbo with their story moving forward. It didn't feel like a real conclusion to the Avengers story arc.As for the time traveling? Don't get me started. Too many plot holes, too many questions, too many ""wait, what about"" moments.It's a comic book movie. It is what it is. It's definitely not a 9/10 movie.I gave this movie a 7.5.",positive
"All characters are amazing. I like captain marvel. Thor character is not as expected. Thor has different character in this part.
All in all movies to too good and it deserve 9 stars.",positive

"I'm happy other reviewers see this movie for what it is. I've watched this movie 3 times to make sure my feelings were true and they are this movie made me upset and disappointed. I hated what they did to Thor, yes i understand he was depressed and all but they really did him dirty and it wasn't funny or appreciated. They nerfed Hulk, and he got no rematch with Thanos he didn't even do anything Hulky. The plot was too stupid and confusing. What happened with Cap? How is he an old man now that popped up out of nowhere in the end? How did Thanos and his whole entire army get to the future? Did Dr. Strange know that a rat would ultimately save mankind? How waa strombreaker not able to do anything against Thanos? Why is Thanos stronger WITHOUT the gauntlet?
Also Captain Marvel was pretty useless in this movie with that nauseating haircut.
My beloved Black Widow is dead and didn't get a funeral or anything! Why didn't they bring her back from a different time lime or whatever like they did Gamora?
And Bucky got robbed too! He should have picked up the shield not Falcon.
I could go on and on for days. I think everyone is so caught up in the hype they didn't actually give any thought to what they were watching. Well at least I still have Infinity War and of course the OG Avengers to watch.",negative
"The first Avenger's was amazing, the second pretty good, the third entertaining - but this final one was epic! With less characters in it (after what happened in the previous film) it didn't suffer from the same issue as Infinity War - too many characters that ended up being a little wasted.A very fitting ending to the series - go see it now!",positive
"What an absolute gem of a movie. It's not just a movie but a wonder of our times. You just cannot stop appreciating it. The cast, the director,producers and all the team associated. Bravo. You have produced a gem. Thanks for 10 years of love.",positive

"Fans of Marvel have been waiting to see this movie for a year but in reality we've waited to see this movie since the first Marvel movie in 2008 because this movie is the culmination of 11 years of the Marvel and Avengers as we've grown to know and love.Infinity War set a high standard for me and it was really hard to imagine that this movie would surpass that and to be honest I am not really sure if it does or doesn't. I've seen the movie a couple of hours ago and everything is still very fresh and trust me, there is a lot to take in. Nevertheless I feel that the movie is excellent and really well done.A big worry for me was that due to Captain Marvel being extremely OP she would swoop in at the end and destroy everyone, saving the day and being a super superhero. Thankfully that did not happen, although at one point I got big scared when she started smashing everyone. The Russo brothers introduced her to the Avengers really well, she was there for about 15 minutes of screen time and was really a background character which was a very smart thing to do because the last thing you want to do is shove a character down fans throats, especially a new one who has not yet been established, in the long run it will do well for Brie Larson and Captain Marvel.Hawkeye was missing from the Infinity War movie so in Endgame he got a big part, showing how much of a badass he truly is. He has had some crucial scenes in this movie and was one of the main characters which he deserves it since he was a part of the Marvel team for a very long time. He did a great job here and the fans will only grow to like him even more.Black Widow death was a bit of a shock to me. She was one of the characters I was adamant would survive because she has a movie coming out next year. Boy, was I wrong. She was there since the beginning and a big part of Avengers, in the end she sacrificed herself for the greater good. She wouldn't let Hawkeye sacrifice himself because he has a family and kids who need him and she always felt that the only family she has ever had was Avengers and she would do anything and everything for the greater good of that family. An honorable exit for an alumn of this franchise. She will be missed.Thanos is one of the best villains we have seen and ever will see. Thor decapitated him 15 minutes into the movie but we all knew from the trailer that he would come back and wreak havoc on the Avengers one more time. And he does. Even without Infinity Stones he proves just how incredibly strong he is, battling Iron Man, Captain America and Thor successfully. In the end he fails and gets erased from the existence but his actions will always scar the Avengers in many ways.The big death of the movie is of course Iron Man. He is the OG, the one who started it and the one who carried it for very, very long. Robert Downey Jr. will forever be Iron Man and every time you utter those words or mention Iron Man, you will immediately be linked to RDJ's face. He was the one to take the stones from Thanos and ""snap"" everything back to good, in the end he couldn't survive that and sacrificed himself for the Avengers. He is a staple of this franchise and it will be very hard to imagine another Avengers movie without him.Captain America survives this movie but Steve Rogers is not longer Captain America. He travels through time to return the Infinity Stones but doesn't come back when expected, instead he comes back as a old man who lived his life with his love Peggy Carter, growing old and happy. At the end he gives the shield to Falcon so that he becomes the next Captain and takes his place.There's not many things I didn't like in this movie but that part is definitely a hit and a miss for me. After all this time and all those movies dedicated to Bucky Barnes (Winter Soldier, Civil War), lifelong friendship and build up for him to assume the role of Captain after Steve Rogers, they went with Falcon instead? That just makes no sense to me. I know that Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, as well as Bucky Barnes in the comics but there was little to no build up for us to even treat Sam Wilson as anything more than a sidekick, that's all he ever was and now all of a sudden he assumes the role of one of the biggest superheroes instead of Bucky Barnes. It pissed me off and was definitely a wrong decision by Disney and Marvel.Overall the movie is excellent and definitely doesn't let fans down, it's a spectacle and an emotional experience that deserves to be spoken with the same praise as Infinity War.The future for Marvel and Avengers is very unknown after Endgame, so far we know next to nothing but after Spiderman and Phase 3 ends hopefully we will get some more information.This is definitely the end of an era and in my opinion the peak of Avengers. This is the best it will probably ever get and we should treasure these movies and these experiences for very long time.",positive
Never ever imagined the movie would end without Tony Stark the creator of the series,positive
"This film did a great job of taking years of work and pulling it together to close the phase. Glad the movie wasn't just one action scene and had some plot (because I'm not 10). And I didn't care that it was 3 hours, I would rather a long movie than a dull one. The only small gripe I had was the time loop confusion. That got a lot of people. Although I accepted that there was no way of doing it more clearly (especially without fan rage of characters not being brought back). Also if you haven't seen every single marvel movie, I wouldn't see this movie yet. It's made as part of a series, you wouldn't see Star Wars return of the Jedi without watching empire strikes back.",positive
"First off Avengers End game is a good movie At least for me I enjoyed it. It served as the grand Finale for all of the previous Marvel films, but felt like more of a fan service orgy instead of a neatly wrapped present only missing the bow to finish it off. Everything feels rushed just to get more and more screen time for the fan service. Still a watch by any means just ultimately disappointing compared to other good Marvel films.",positive

There's no question about that; unlike Infinity War, which, let's be honest, if you don't like the movie then I have several questions, but if you hate Endgame, I can't really blame you. The choices made by the writers and directors, let's just say their questionable at worst.When the movie is good, it's great. Amazing, even. You get great references and fun nods to if you were paying attention in previous movies. The humor (When they aren't fat jokes) is surprisingly clever and even dark, especially for the first act where Thor is all mopey and everyone's sad and moody. All the characters bar a few (We'll get to that later) had a proper send off and have perfect arcs when the movie ended. Iron Man's death was perfect, though I would have liked it better if Thanos directly killed him, I kinda hoped Steve would die, but you know: What can you do? Also I felt like the whole 40's dance with Peggy was too fast:; I would have liked to see him return and then they party, enjoy the booming 50s and drink and all that. Hawkeye was amazing in this film; he pretty much stopped being useless for one movie. Widow was also great, though the fight to the death scene...I don't know I just didn't feel it. Ant-Man was surprisingly awesome and Paul Rudd's acting when he reunites with an older Cassie is just beautiful. Rhodey finally gets something to do, Rocket is also fun......but Thor OH GOD. Ok, I'm perfectly fine with Thor being fat; it's at least understandable and relatable. But the fat jokes were just too much and they stopped being funny after 5 minutes. But, at the very least he had his moment in IW and obviously he's not gone for good because GOTG 3 is still a thing. What did bother me was hulk, who unlike Thor, was a complete joke in both films. What happened? Did the writers just give up? We didn't even get Hulk fighting Thanos in the final fight scene! Thanos is actually was OK with despite him not being as great as IW Thanos, but it's OK since this Thanos isn't a battle-scarred general who's lost everything overnight. Captain Marvel shows up to look cool, act cocky, get a haircut and then we never see her again. Thank God. Other negatives I have with the film is the entire second act. It was fun and cool to return to the previous films, but it stretched on a little too long. The first act should have been long; getting to know a post-snap world and how everyone's getting by. I don't care about Time Travel laws, but the entire second act still felt too long. However, the final act was still epic and mindblowing. Some characters like Wanda had their spotlight to 1v1 Thanos, but it wasn't enough. Drax didn't get a hit in, Hulk didn't get one, Bucky and Steve didn't even say a word to each other in that fight, and of course, that A-Force scene. Why?Final word: The movie isn't perfect, but it's very enjoyable. If you like the MCU, chances are you will like this movie too, but if you hate botched character finales and time travel, you'll hate this one. None of the time travel makes any sense at all. The movie on its own in my opinion is solid, the story is fine but nothing special, but as a fan and with the boat-loads of fanservice and all that, this movie gets an 11/10 subjectively for me. Is it the best movie of 2019? I'd say why are we even comparing? There's no need to compare this with Godzilla or John Wick, just enjoy the movie for what it is; a satisfying, if not flawed, conclusion to MCU's first 3 seasons.Oh, but I still hate the A-Force scene. That scene alone dropped this movie's score from a 9 to an 8.",positive
"I cannot put my emotions into words. I cried four times, properly sobbing: 1# when black widow sacrificed herself😭. 2# when Pepper held iron man and said ""rest"" then he died😭. 3# when Peggy and Steve danced at the end😭. I give this film 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 by far the best Marvel movie so far...",positive
"I understand how the time travel didn't stick to what most movie time travel is like but hulk explained that what they do doesn't change the present and everyone is complaining about the time travel, the ancient one also explained that it doesn't change, it just opens alternate realities which were fixed when cap returned the stones.I was a little disappointed when Thor stayed fat the entire movie. He should have just gone and done like 4000 pushups and sit-ups and gotten a haircut but it didn't bother me too much.The final fight scene was about 30 minutes not 8 like I saw one review say. Iron mans death was so sad I almost cried because he is one of my favorite characters, but they created an awesome way for him to go.As for cap getting old I felt like that needed to happen because if cap could wield mjolnir then it would completely mess up his character and be weird for future movies.This movie has its downsides but the goods out weigh the bads so much that it is a great movie. P.S I doubt this will be the last avengers movie, so many more incredibly powerful villains left.",positive
Endgame encapsulates the greatness of the MCU. The only reason why I am not giving it a 10 is because of the few scenes that weren't really bothering but unnecessary. Besides that the movie is a 10.,positive
"Its really great, end it in the best way.the most succesfull xmen movie, days of future past, is using the ""time traveler"" formula, and marvel use the same formula.i was hoping marvel use other mindblowing idea",positive
"I REALLY loved watching this epic conclusion to one of the most respected franchises of all time. With 'Endgame', this movie has exceeded all expectations for all Marvel fans out there. The Russos, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, and Kevin Feige had a lot of fun assembling this billion-dollar-worthy masterpiece. It can get emotional at times, but it is worth all the fun. 'Endgame' has achieved the top rank that outshines every other MCU movie ever existed. The heroes can think, act, and react because of their challenges they had to go through.For Marvel - keep up the good work.",positive
"((*SPOILERS*)) I did not like how they did Thor. Making him an alcoholic with a beer gut?! Come on! And Hulk?!?!?! WHAT THE HECK?! He has been made weaker and weaker since THOR RAGNAROK. The source of his powers are the madder he gets, the more indestructible he is. Being half hulk and half banner would've made him easy to to dominate over. I did like the sacrifices. Made it good. The actual story was ok but not great like the other movies. I gave it a 7 be it ok. Not the worst I've seen and not the best.",positive
"This movie was pure trash, it was slow and lacking, it didn't have the climax that the Infinity war had. The male characters took all the spotlight throughout the entire movie. Captain Marvel barely had any limelight in the movie. Poor Natasha Romanov, the way she died, to me was very unfair, and Hawkeye became a rogue criminal, killing innocent people just because his family was gone.Really, like he was the only one loosing a family! In the other hand, Thanos was nothing but a dull villain with no solid purpose whatsoever.The plot was too rushed. One other thing was I didn't like how the Russo's brothers portrayed The Hulk in Endgame. I thought he was going to have a rematch with Thanos after loosing to him in Infinity war. A fat Thor! are you kidding me Marvel, one of the most powerful avengers and you made this guy look like the god of mommy issues! I tell you there were too many flaws in this movie. At the end I have to admit Deadpool was right, I don't want to see another Avengers movie.",negative
"Absolutely great! Loved the storyline, the acting, everything! I gave it 9 stars though because the hole ""changing the past does not change the present"" is nonsense! The time travel makes no sense, but I loved it anyway :)))",positive
Best movie ever if you haven't seen it you must go see it specially if your a fan i enjoyed every second of it 😊👍,positive
The Russo brothers knocked one out of the park with this movie! Sign them up for movies within the Star Wars franchise. Marvel tied a beautiful bow with this movie in order to wrap up the Avengers series.,positive
"So many theories i have made about this movie it goes beyond expectations
Beyond imagination
This marvel universe movie truly made things memorable and emotional.
Its worth every single minute I watched every marvel movie.SPOLER AHEADLoved it 3000 times
Will miss RDJ and Chris Evans in future marvel movies.
High point was captain America holding Thor's hammer, Thor's humour, Iron mans snap.
WHAT A EPIC SAGA.",positive
"With the events that occurred in Avengers: Infinity War (man was that film a riot) it left me speechless and not even knowing what was gonna happen next. So you can obviously assume that I was going into Avengers: Endgame with super high hopes. Probably with more higher hopes than any other theater experience for me. Not only were those hopes granted, but they were exceeded.Avengers: Endgame really is a film to be seen by all. Not only is it a cinematic epic, you will feel something you've never felt before with any other movie experience. Avengers: Endgame is by far the most epic, emotional, heart-wrenching, and action packed feature that Marvel has ever released. You will have moments have laughter, anger, sadness, hopefulness, etc. All emotions you could think of from watching a movie is all here.Every character that you've come to know and love gets the right amount of screen time. Each play a part and some even give us some very unexpected surprises, but in a good way. All the actors from Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man to Brie Larson as Captain Marvel give great performances. Some even having their best moments in this movie. Josh Brolin as Thanos will give you chills just as epic as the ones he displayed from Avengers: Infinity War.The story's got more weight to it than it does from its predecessor. You don't expect how the story will go and which decisions will be made by the characters. This movie gives us many surprises. Definitely some of the best writing a Marvel production has given us.I just wanna give my highest respects to the directors Joe and Anthony Russo for giving us such a masterful experience. For a studio to build up eleven years leading up to this film that has satisfied me and many others, that is a tremendous accomplishment within itself. Also a huge s/o to the actors who have been playing these timeless characters for years and for making them feel incredibly real. All who helped make this movie come into existence should receive high praises.What else can I say. It is the greatest super hero movie I've ever seen. All I can do left is to tell you to go see it if you haven't already. For those who have been dedicated fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for years or if they are new in the game, you will not regret seeing this. It is a thrill that must be seen to be believed.",positive
"It might just be a tiny,teensy,little bit overrated.like0.001%",positive
"Not saying what happened but 3 hours are way too long. There could be easily 30 minutes cut due to long scenes and plot discovery.Lots of people had to""hit the head"" because of the long scenes.Just saying",positive
The twisted story so far came to end in this movie. I've enjoyed end game so much however in the end it's turned into very emotional when ironman and nat died. This movie is all about unity how all superheroes united and save the world from thanos and his army who desired to conquer earth.,positive
"They take some risks while still being an ultimately predictable, although enjoyable experience. Wraps up arcs that have been developing over the past decade.",positive
"Ive seen all Avengers movies, and yet I havent learned my lesson.... ""These movies are really not for me""... story is super shallow... the ending is so predictable.... im just comparing this trash to the likes of ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy of Christopher Nolan or Spider-Man trilogy of Sam Raimi... these trilogies remain my favorites of all time.",negative
"After sleeping a night over what i just have seen endgame leaves me with a smile on my face. Sure the humor went far off in some scenes and not everyone could love dude thor but it all had its reasons. The whole plot though we knew it included timetravel completely surprised and three hours just flight by. I enjoyed the movie and also understood the sobbing of some people in the audience during specific scenes. Overall i just can't give less than 10 stars simply due to the fact that this movie wraps up 11years of pure joy in my opinion.
I only disliked the fact that they had to introduce cpt marvel in her own movie just for 5min screentime. Femme fatale scene also was not necessary at all. Black Widows prequel would have been a way better choice so we could understand her action better. Cpt. Marvel would have been a solo movie option after showcasing her in endgame but thats just what came up to my mind.
But i have to thank marvel for the past 11 years!",positive

A Plot Element that set up its rules, but kinda broke them especially in the end. (Overall, I didn't care that much because that element will always have Convoluted Mess in movies that can easily be nitpicked)In conclusion, this is definitely my favorite MCU movie. This is a thank you letter for the fans who stuck with this franchise for 10+ years and this is their reward. Highly recommend watching more than once because it gets better each viewing.My score : 9.2/10",positive
Go see now it's by far the best superhero movie ever made hands down.,positive
I highly recommend to watch this incredible superhero movie. It was amazing and had an incredible ending.,positive
Some of the scenes were unnecessary and could've been just cut out entirely and the movie would still make sense. I expected more from this 3-hour film but it turned out to be just a complete waste of time,positive
"OK, this is not a bad movie, and it has plenty of good moments to enjoy. But it feel like the flat final part of a roller-coaster, the fun part is over and it only remains...The endind, getting off the ride.I've watched all the MCU movies, some many times. I've seen toons of interviews, and I love those guys. So my expectations where huge after Infinity War. I've enjoyed them, and I'm willing to overlook plotholes, or forced solutions...As long as I don't end up thinking about them instead of the plot, during the movie.---Spoliers ahead---Each MCU movie lets you longing for the next. Part of this down feeling is that now I'm not looking forward to anything. Stan Lee is gone, that's part of it too. Even after Infinity War, the dramatic irony was that we all knew the dead characters were coming back, no doubt (With Spiderman Far from Home, and other characters having more movie deals). But now what?So fans, prior to the movie, we knew many things:
The dead were coming back.There would probably be time travel involved, as well as the Quantum Realm.RDJ and Chris Evans where at the end of their contract.So the bar was high in terms of surprises, we already suspected the big ""revelations"" of the film. So, for me the point was what they where going to do to keep me interested anyway. And, for me, when I expected the big clever satisfactory endind twist, instead, all I got was a fist fight.And a fist fight that violated the laws of the previous movie. In Infinity War, Ironman held his ground against Thanos for a bit, Cap could grabb the Gaunlet and surprised Thanos, Thor almost cut him in half. All of that against a Thanos that had all or most of the stones. Now those three together, with 2 godly weapons, are easily defeated by a ""lesser"" Thanos. As a fan, I expected Thanos to put up a fight with his wit, not his fists (or his army).But I'd be willing to overlook that if I had something in exchange. And this is the main downside of this movie. What I got was depressing, depressing, a bit of hope, depressing...Then 20 minutes of fight, and then more depressing stuff (death, getting old, characters that don't know each other...). The joyful ""resurrection"" happened off camera, and we didn't have time to celebrate or enjoy it. We have enough depressing things in real life, thanks.On another note, even as a man I felt insulted by the forced attempt at feminism, right before a guy with ""man"" in his name wins the fight. It felt like a half-hearted throw of a bone, very disrespectful to the female fandom. Sorry, embarrasing.I'd like to talk about the good things too. And the respect I have for the collective effort the cast and crew made. But I left the movie theatre very sad, and that's still how I feel.Sad movies can be good too, but that's not what I expected from this. When you watch interviews and press conferences with a bunch of the cast members, you see they are funny, and they have a lot of chemistry, and they celebrate each other as a family. That's what I would have loved to experience in the film.I give it a 7, because it's worth watching. And because I'm up for people doing ambitious and risky films, even if they fail to satisfy my expectations.",positive
"I can't believe how unbelievable these last 2 Avengers movies have been. They build upon the character's relationships and build upon the other movies! The only disappointment was I feel like the two movies seem very similar, (infinity war and endgame.) 9/10.",positive
"I thought the actual action was very solid, but not a good storyline...",positive
These guys putting up fake reviews! End game is a waste of time and money! Weak story line! Hardly any action for thanos! Many things in the movie unexplained how they happened! Thor made a laughing stock! Why why! Big let down!,negative
"It wasn't what we expected it to be. The whole thing, the effects, the whole plot, the way the writer and the director put everything they had into this film was what kept 90% of the audience at the edge of their seat. We cried.

Marvel is on top and will stay on top for years to come.,positive
"Avengers: Endgame is undoubtedly the greatest movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ultimately the highest grossing movie of all time, the best Avengers movie, the peak of the MCU, and the epic finale of the Infinity Saga. The 3-hour movie fits in the dejection from the Avengers' loss in Infinity War, as well as the incredible fight for our lives in which the dusted Avengers finally return to decimate the army of the Mad Titan and save the universe.",positive
"This movie exceeds your wildest imagination about how things gets concluded...
Tony stark aka Iron man you are the one why I started watching marvel movies other than Iron man and will miss you and always love you 3000 times...
Kudos to whole cast and crew
And the ultimate legends the Russos.... take a bow truly blown away from your endgame.
Thanks marvel for making our 11 yrs remarkable.
Always a marvel fan #whateverittakes",positive
"I actually really liked two 3rds of this film. The time travel was done really well and the motivation was great. The way the heist was executed was awesome. Got some superb character development and arks to watch. ""I'm still worthy!"" was a favourite line for sure. The hawkeye and black widow scene was severly lacking in chemistry but that's ok. Plot worked fine. It was all going well, until...In the last act, it just turned into another US military propaganda ending. ""I am Ironman."" Come on. Perhaps Americans can't see it because it is so prolific in that culture, but it sticks out like a sore thumb from where I'm sitting. ""Captain America"" stands against the army of invaders alone, proud. It's a great comic book moment but it's just all too relevent to current affairs to be entertaining. Then America leads the world against the baddies and they murder everyone in the name of peace. Ironman gets the gaunlet at the end and instead of thinking of a genius 'only tony stark' character ark completion 11/10 moment where he finds a way to create peace without killing anyone. He just asserts ""I am Ironman"" (military industrial complex personified then) and murders the invaders! How is he any different from Thanos?1/3 of the film is spent mourning the 50% of living beings that died, and then Tony just does the same back to them. So...what is the moral here? The moral of the story is this: murder is ok if you kill ALL of them. Then they can't come back at you and you win because you write history. It's the Amalocites all over again. Given that this is a 10 year long project ending, I hoped they would be leaving a lasting and pertinent message for the future generation but instead, it's just the same old war-mongering ending as always.Humans may never learn that violence only ever begets more violence. There is unequivically no such thing as violence in the name of peace. Do not be fooled.",positive
"Best Avengers & MCU movie ever.This is a crossover that you will remember forget.The visual effects,fighting scene everything was awesome.",positive
"There were EASILY 45-minutes of this film that should have ended up on the editing room floor. All the things I couldn't stand about the Harry Potter and the LOTR worlds, namely the melodrama and seriousness, have been splattered all over my cinematic universe. When, (spoiler redacted) dies, I was seriously thinking, ""I know (spoiler redacted) is a big effing deal but he/she has been in the process of dying for 11 hours and 5 minutes."" That was the thing about all the major deaths too. Pretty much all the heroes who fall have frustratingly long funereal sequences, as if a real person died. If (spoiler redacted) had died in real life during the production of the flick, then, by all means, have a sappy, meandering funeral scene for him. However, (spoiler redacted) is alive and VERY WELL; so, that funeral was a ridiculous waste of time. I would have enjoyed spending that time watching well-executed action sequences and superhero shenanigans. Not to mention, these deaths are not even vaguely sad to me. The MCU has countless avenues by which they may resurrect ostensibly any character offed; so, yeah, with that in mind, give me a break with all the very ""DC"" gloom. My last beef is with Captain Marvel. Seems to me she could have ended that mess pretty damn quickly. Instead, she decided to disappear for 2/3 of the movie, visit the worst barber shop in the galaxy while she was gone, and then reappear just in time to demonstrate how easy this whole ordeal could have been handled had she only stuck around in the first place. It's kind of stupid to have her in the movie, because the MCU has adorned her with such omnipotence that no foe stands a chance. She's like bringing a bazooka to a water-balloon fight. One second, everyone's splashing around, having a good time. Then, Danvers shows up and the whole neighborhood ends up dead. She's just too powerful to be cinematically useful. Movies featuring Carol Danvers that are longer than 30 minutes are not really being honest. Overall, ""Endgame"" was exhausting. Somebody had to tackle the undertaking of its creation. In that task, the cast and crew were largely successful; but, still, something was missing. Maybe Paul Bettany was the Avengers' lucky charm.",positive
"I tried to rewatch this pathetic movie 3 times. 1st time from the very beginning, 2nd time from 30th minutes, 3d time from 60th minute. With the same result: the film was just boring. Waste of time.",negative
"So by this point you all know what this movie is and what it's about. I'm just going to give you the good and the bad:The Bad: Some of Captain America's decisions at the end seems slightly out of character. Since it's the last movie, I kind of wish we spent more time with the ""Classic"" versions of these characters. It does assume that you have seen all of the other movies.Good: Pretty much every thing else. Strong finale. Possibly one of the best versions of superhero fight scene ever put on film. Nebula's full good guy turn surprisingly works (it helps that film Nebula is much more likable than comic Nebula). It gives the Lord of the Ring finale a run for it's money while giving all the characters even those who are there for brief cameos a chance to shine.",positive
This movie was so amazing I love the adventure of searching and retrieving all the infinity stones I watched this movie 3 weeks ago and just now decided to write a review. The best bit was the ending war where everyone came and joined together to fight Thanos's army. 10 outta 10 the best movie i could have ever watched,positive
"With a runtime of 3 hours it blew by so quickly. Watching it in a packed theater for the first time was fantastic. We all laughed, gasped, jumped, and fell silent in unison. From the residual laughter after a funny scene to the soft sobs of people processing the deaths; we all shared in the viewing of a true masterpiece.The acting was fantastic. The story telling was brilliant. They gave us what we wanted and deserved without compromise or restraint.I'm sad to say goodbye but excited for where they are taking us next.",positive
"First 30 min of the movie I got super bored. It was like oí vei if this continues like that I will be falling asleep pretty quickly. However emotions started to arise first the a little of hope ( The Rat and Ant-man ) then Cassie and Ant-man, Tony, Professor Hulk, Ronin, but then Fat Thor came along and I could not stop laughing and giggling every time he showed. After that it was amazing all the way till the end. Every single emotion started to show all in a period of 2 and a half hours, happy, sad, melancholy, nerves, anger, you name it! I don't give a full 10 for those first 30 min!",positive
"Not done this in a while but here we go....I was shocked by how much I had enjoyed this film, especially from not really enjoying Avengers: Infinity War. I felt from the third entry, it let down the franchise a bit, but from the conclusion of the entire series wrapping the first Three Phrases it deserves 10/10.Without going into to much detail of the film and spoiling for others. This film had a very similar vibe from another superhero movie I have seen, but with similar context this film made it, it's own! Very well put together from the relationship of the characters, the humour and even the emotional moments. :)",positive
Great movie got everything movie needs and it very entertaining.,positive
"Woke ideology infects some movies more than others. This was not as woke as captain Marvel, but it was more woke than most of the other DCU movies. Maybe it's a quirk of mine, but when a clear agenda is forced unnaturally into a plot, it suspends my suspension of disbelief. It's still entertaining, and I love 3D, so it gets a 7.",positive

"Its a Bit underwhelming for this last thing.But you can watch it without out dying, although ist pretty sad.",positive
"When Infiniti War ended by Thanos winning, I hated it. Though I new that this year's Avengers Endgame is going to be going back to the past etc. But never thought they will end it by Iron Man's death and the Captain's retirement. Who's going to save the world when another Thanos is born in the Universe?
Thank You.",negative
"This movie is revolutionary In what it has done. This movie was able to make a satisfying end to the biggest cinematic universe ever.
There were many things in the movie which wouldn't normally be given a pass, however for such an ambitious project,most people-including me, were willing to turn a blind eye.
This was a great movie for what it is meant to be, and I believe it achieved all it set out to do.",positive
"Movie was just made to kill 3 characters and to continue marvel franchise by bringing back dead ones.. apart from it what was expected never materialized.. hulk wasted, action in movie is for name sake,their is no punch in movie as expected.. it simply like a Bollywood masala movie",positive
"People say this movie is the end of an era! That may be true for some, but if Marvel continues down this path for these movies, I'll be watching every movie until the day I die! Such a perfect stepping stone for the past 10 years of movies. This movie hit me differently than I ever thought imaginable. Definitely a must-see if you're into action movies.",positive
"This is by far one of the greatest cinematic events in history. This film was just a pure masterpiece. To be honest, the beginning was pretty slow, but after an hour and a half, the movie got epic. What a way to conclude the story of marvel's most beloved heroes.",positive

"This is the best action movie i have seen in my life at no point of it's 3 HOUR runtime was I not interested and at times where the fight scenes were happening I was really pumped and my arm was unironically shacking from all of enjoyment i was having, I remeber laughing alot too at the very funny jokes in the movie.",positive
"I was really looking forward to see this movie but after all, it was a little disappointing.
Yes, all the characters of the mcu are in the movie and yes, it was nice to see other perspectives of the ""old"" movies.
BUT: a lot of talking (yes, also funny one-liners) about feelings and how happy they were or are or what could have been.
The fight is way too short!
And every time captain Marvel shows up you ask yourself: why isn't she just ending everything by herself?
Anyway, it's a good movie and the three hours flew by, but it's just not the ending I was hoping for :(",positive
"The slow pace in the beginning can surely be overlooked considering what's in stock during the second half of the movie. Although I'm not a vehement Marvel fan, it's apposite to say this movie a befitting end to the Thanos saga. Respect to Russo brothers for being able to pull off an onerous task of concluding the tapestry MCU has created over the decade.These movies are basically an end to 21 movies. So, the payoffs were huge. I loved that Captain used Mjolnir. Thor was most ridiculous for me in both Infinity War and Endgame. The tone of the character doesn't work somehow after Ragnarok, either he's cracking joke after Thanos kills Asgardians and Loki or he's being a self-pitying alcoholic post the snap. Captain Marvel does what she was introduced to do in this universe, she pops up where it is convenient to the plot. The fact that her character had less screen time was apposite to me considering her underwhelming origin movie. The surprising character was Clint. Even though his screen time in previous movies is less, the transformation of an uber agent after losing everything to become a ruthless killer in search of solace/purpose is intriguing. Ronan kind of reminded me of John Wick. But when Clint is given hope to undo what's done by the mad titan, you can see the compassionate and kind side of him; the scene between him and Agent Romanoff is heart-warming and poignant at the same time. The humane nature explored in Clint's character made is supremely engaging. I wanted more screen time for Doctor Strange so that I can hear more about his one in fourteen million possibilities. Professor Hulk was a fun character. And Iron Man sacrificing himself was an audacious move for the writers. I was reminded of a dialogue by Kylo Ren in The Last Jedi when he says to Ray, ""Let the past die.Kill it, if you have to."" This movie is more rewarding to the MCU fans. It is a love letter to the original Avengers. The makers have done everything which was warranted to close this chapter spanning a decade.",positive
"Infinity War was the movie I loved. Endgame had way too many plot holes, the huge battle could've been a lot longer with more of the heroes fighting, many had very little screen time. I get its about dealing with the effects of Thanos snapping the world universe in half but just a frustrating end for me.",positive
The intro sets the theme of the whole movie and what a boring slugfest this is.,negative
"Pure emotions went through while watching this movie. I cried I laughed, I cried again and then I laughed and this was the perfect end to a Saga of superheroes who made our childhood awesome!
Thanks to Russo Brothers for this awesome and unbelievable direction, Avengers Cast for bringing their best at the right time and of course not to forget STAN LEE❤",positive
"Spoiler free review!
I cried, I laughed, I cried and I laughed again and this is what we all did throughout the movie. The direction of MCU and particularly for this movie is unbelievable. All characters, as well as the story, are giving a perfect end to the Saga.

The amazing three hours. I wasn't bored for a minute. Thanos is amazing again. Captain America is best hero. The final battle was fantastic. It is emotional and incredible movie. The Russo Brothers are gods. Avengers Assamble,positive
"When you commit 3 hours to a Marvel flick, nobody is under the illusion they're watching an Oscar contender. If youre for escapism and a few laughs that's what you get in the MCU, and this instalment doesn't disappoint.",positive
"The connections that we have made with these characters all these years comes full circle in this movie and it is pulled off in an incredible, emotional, epic finale",positive
"1 jam yang membosankan, seharusnya dipotong. jalannya cerita terlalu lambat",positive
"It's the finale! But they choose to not focus on CGI, EDITING, SOUNDTRACK, CINEMATOGRAPHY, even in storyline! (Time travel, paradox, time here is 5 hours, there is 5 seconds) Same old story! Nothing new, nothing special! They made this movie only to remind us the old MCU movies, it's funny, it's pathetic! Zero new elements, zero imagination! It was 2 hours and 30 minutes pointless and only 30 mins worth! ( Black Widow storyline, Iron Man storyline) About Captain America, they give him poor ending, about Thor, they made him a Joke! About Hulk, they made him powerless! About the other characters, they put them in the movie only to say that they put them! And finally, ZERO PURE SUPERHERO ACTION!!! Only 10-15 minutes, only!! For me, its one of the most overrated movies of all time! Disappointed.",negative
This film is an epic conclusion to the Infinity Saga which started in 2008 with Iron Man. All the 21 films are definitely worth seing together ass a whole for this films characters to work along with their motives and actions. This film is by far the most different from any of the other MCU-films which I found extremely refreshing and entertaining.,positive
"My love for super heros was already big, when Iron Man hit the theaters. Since then, it was all about those Marvel movies. The build up to this epic climax was just insane, never has there been something like that. Infinity War was shocking, but this epic last movie and the closure it brings to the infinity saga was just absolut perfect.There was no example how they could end such iconic charakters, because there where never such iconic charakters before with so many movies and story archs.I loved it. I teared up a bit.Thank you marvel for those memories. I think that was one of the best movies i have ever watched - or maybe even ""the best"".",positive
"This movie is one of the only movies or series of movies I have ever seen, to have successfully brought a series to an end and leaving me with the satisfaction that my money was well spent. This movie will make you laugh and cry and honestly although it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, it will always have a place in my heart as well as other because of the hugely profound effect the marvel franchise has had on my childhood.",positive
"This movie deserves a 10/10 however one thing should be said that narrative wise, it cannot stand on it's own. Other than that be sure that you will have a great time. And a lot of heartfelt moments of nostalgia. And 10 different levels of awesome one could not believe was imaginable.",positive
Already seen it twice and I will watch it again.It's the end of an era and everything about this movie is beyond incredible.Avengers Ensemble,positive
This movie is the perfect send off to a series that has been around since 2008 with the original iron man. the final battle scene was all you could ask for and left me breathless but i do wish chris evans could stay around.,positive
"It's not bad for a comic book to movie film, but, seriously folks, This is a joke. Re-added scenes to ""catch"" Titanic? Get serious! Titanic is an absolute masterpiece compared to this. Too many 'analytic' reviwes already here, so I won't go into details, but this is just nowhere near the hype it got.",positive
"Emotional. The perfect goodbye. A movie for the fans, to the fans.",positive
"I remember getting excited like this for Deathly Hallows part 2, but this movie is leagues ahead of that. I've been a fan since the first Avenger film and this is an amazing tribute to all those years. If your not a fan you will not understand some of the characters, references, and some of those subtle jokes referencing past films. Don't listen to reviews from non fans, they don't really understand why this film works. Great film.",positive
I hate to see iron man in this movie frankly because of his real life character.,negative
"I would like to review it without spoilers, but I know I won't be able to... So here is my list:Liked:
* Hulk. Like all others, except Captain America, this original avenger has a very good growth arc. He is the embodiment of the inner division so many of us feel (wonder if this was the inspiration for the character - to give the inner rage, inner ""i just want to smash things"", which most of us so often have to suppress of keep deeply hidden due to our social role, mask). This Hulk is the result of inner peace that is so hard to find - just be a friend to yourself. The scene where current Hulk tries to be the Smash-all-things Hulk is very funny because it stresses the big inner differences between them. Just like the remark: ""I wear shirts now"". It uses very well the point in timespace when clothes became a symbol of ""being civilised"".* Black Widow and Hawkeye. These two have one of the best friendships on screen of all times. The love they have for each other could be easily felt in their every scene over the various films. I already saw some complains from a very bias group about he fate of Black Widow, but I assume that they are the kind of people where personal agenda wins over the character consistency. Back Widow has only one family - Hawkeye's family. She was the only one (except Fury, but he knew because of work) who knew about Hawkeye's family. They even named their kid after her, so you know that they each considers one another very closer. Closer than anyone else. And they will do everything for one another. Their main scene showed that very well too. There is no way Black Widow would have let her sister in law and her nephews and nieces live without a father. Their friendship is the goal how friendships between man and a woman should be portrayed. And we for sure don't have them enough on the screen.* Iron Man Tony Stark. His story is so symbolic in this one. Everything started with him and ended with him. His unwillingness to go and leave the family he has and the guilt he felt after Peter Parker turned to dust in his arms. Everything was great. Such a turn around from the playboy we first saw to a two women man. Plus, I doubt there is anyone else who is so much Tony Stark in real life as Robert Downey Jr. You will be missed as Tony Stark.* Captain Marvel. As expected, she didn't have a lot of screen time, but came to the final fight. Was she the key in defeating Thanos (or, more precisely, helping Tony to do it)? Debatable. But the visual effects around her are always very nice. I liked that she (and, sort of, was) the key character. This film wasn't about her or any other new character. This was all about the original 6 and including her would have taken that away.* Captain America. For me he is the most boring character. He is already fully developed in his first film and afterwards he doesn't change. On one hand, it is very nice to see such an unbendable morale and code, on the other hand it's a bit boring. His story end though rases for me a lot of questions that have to do with time travel paradox.* Thor. Nailed it!
Dislike:
* No Fury and Carol Danvers scenes. Seriously. Their first meeting after Fury was brought back should have been epic. Especially if Hill was by the side and has Fury something like: ""Nick, what just happened?"". The eye Carol should have given to Fury, the remark about ""everybody calls me Fury"". I also doubt that he would have held up his comments about her hair and her - about his eye. Such a wonderful opportunity missed.",positive
"After having watched all 22 movies in a tight timeframe (10 days), I have several different thoughts and opinions on the MCU franchise. Since this review is for Avengers: Endgame, I will keep my perspective focused on that movie. My favorite character of all time was always Hulk. He was always the ""secret weapon"" and the critical member of the team that could be relied on for tearing stuff up. Ironman was a close second. After watching Endgame, however, the roles for the best Avenger for me has switched. ""Endgame"" really scored for me on an emotional level. There were some ""ah-ha"" moments and some tearful moments as well. I also grew angry at times. Having all these emotional reactions in a 3 hour time frame is not unusual but I had these feelings even as I exited and drove home. Definitely a great movie. I must admit that all 22 movies in the lineup were not all great (I think only 5 would get a repeat watch from me) and some of the character development waned in some movies. In ""Endgame"", I couldn't have major respect for some characters (ie Captain Marvel) because I don't think this character had as much invested as the others over the years even though she was vital to the end war against Thanos. I also loved Scarlett Witch but I think she needs her own character movie. I just wanted to know more about her. The CGI was very well done! I thought Hulk was so cute as he closely resembled his human counterpart, Dr. Banner. I appreciated the return of all the beloved characters to end the fight against Thanos. I did think there were a few plot holes (such as the Ancient One, who is supposed to be all-knowing and all-seeing, not being able to see why Hulk was there to retrieve the Time Stone). Overall, the movie was worth the 3 hours and $15 I invested to see it. The clink of the metal at the end of the credits may signify the return of Ironman (not sure how but it'll be interesting). (On a side note, I wish Angela Bassett had a longer appearance in the movie but I get why she wasn't).",positive
"It's more then a movie. Ah! finally the endgame. undoubtedly its the best of best movie in my life. i mean the epic cinematic universe have done an epic cinematic ending. i was laughing, i was crying, i was clapping i mean i can't control myself for till the movie is running. i can't describe my feeling about this movie. just go, watch this movie and witness an epic battle.",positive
"Avengers Endgame truly created a new milestone. Including fun, tears, legends and anything out of your mind, Endgame is the best Marvel Studios Movies.",positive
Endgame is not your average superhero movie. All the heroes in the end are human. They suffer as well. This movie takes a step back and looks at it from the human point of view. This movie is beautifully crafted and very well paced.To everyone reading the reviews of critics. Don't. Endgame will touch your heart. It's not always fighting thats gonna help you win. Endgame takes the original 6 avengers and gives them a fitting end to the saga.,positive
"This is the best movie ever ! It's funny, has a lot of action and it's very, very, very exciting. And if you do not understand this movie, please don't rate it because it's a very nice movie and I know you need to know A LOT about marvel before you watch it but it's just that people rate it though they do not understand it. If you do not like it, it's different because you can rate it then but not understanding is a different thing. Anyway in my opinion this a fantastic movie. And that's the same for most of the people who understand it. So what I'm trying to say is that this is a movie you will like very much if you see the other MCU movies.",positive
"""I created this account only to give this movie a 1"", or ""I give this a 5 rating but am voting it a 1 just to lower the undeserved high rating"", and of course all the comedians and trolls and the holier than thou of moviedom that give various reasons for trying to adjust this movie's merits, or lack thereof. These are the kind of disappointing reviews I am writing about. Stop adjusting and come to the realization that you didn't get what you wanted from it. Others did.Here's what I think. There was a good mix of action and dialogue. You know, dialogue, the part that tells the story? The CG and non-CG special effects worked for me. The story was a little weak. Time travel is a subject that is still fiction, so I feel no need to try and pick apart the theoretical inconsistencies. Some make the comment that there was too much going on in trying to bring the whole MCU into this movie and that the idea may have been a bad one. Now this is the kind of comment that is useful in a review. I won't say more, since just about anything else could be a spoiler. It was a good 6 out of 10, so I am giving it a 6.",positive
"An amazing marvel movie that made sure the end of the infinity saga and the end of the true 'fase 1' of the MCU is really emotional because this wasn't an infinity war styled action movie, but a character movie. The emotional impact of all the different endings for the original 6 avengers is incredibly high due to the character build up. The best possible death for black widow as a character (although really, really sad) the same goes for tony and the ending of cap. These were the 3 best characters of the movie and did the emotional lifting with perfect performance by the actors. The final battle is like a true comic book with amazing 'wow' moments. The first 2 hours are a little bit to comedic for my liking (thor and bruce are apparently incapable of acting serious for 1 minute, which i didn't really like). But what makes up for that is the insane amount of references to previous films which is just amazing, fan service everywhere. The other supporting cast are great as well, Nebula, Rocket and ant man are great in this movie. I think it will take quite some time before a superhero movie thís good will come out.",positive
The Avengers is not a bad blockbuster for once.Many characters on the same screen united by one goal. That's cool.,positive
"Failure with no purpose , and the rating is all about fans",negative
"I see most people who have decided to review Avengers: Endgame thought the movie was horrible, so I think this film deserves a better rep for those who have yet to see it. Endgame is the conclusion we have all been waiting for from the MCU, and personally I think Endgame did a brilliant job at giving the audience something to cry about, laugh about, smile about, and just love.
Being a huge fan of the Marvel film franchise, I did not think that the ending this movie gave us was lacklustre, or less exciting than Infinity War. Personally, I would have to say this movie was even better than Infinity War, most likely due to the fact that it is the grand finale of all these movies, but honestly the movie was just that memorable.
There was never a moment where I was bored during this 3 hour film. Whilst most people snark at the idea of sitting down for that long for a movie, once I had watched it I fully understood why it had to be that way. To finish this big of a legacy takes a lot of time, and within those 3 hours I could just feel myself submerge into the wider MCU one last time (needless to say, there will be plenty more Marvel movies), and I definitely enjoyed every part of it.
This movie is definitely worth a watch if you like action, romance, heartbreak, and just an overall good story line. Avengers: Endgame definitely deserves it's praise and so much more.",positive
"THEE perfect end to the best 10 years of cinema history. Don't think I'll care much for what happens after this. I think my favorite line in the whole film was when Carol Danvers said ""I'm going to be gone...a long time..."". But seriously, 10/10 for every emotion felt in this film. Truly amazing.",positive
"I watched the movie yesterday but I didn't give a review because I couldn't think of what to say, until now. Avengers Endgame is truly an awesome and perfect finale for the past 22 movies in 11 years. The end to such a grand saga couldn't have been better. The movie is epic and out of the world. The hardwork of the cast and the whole crew can surely be seen in the movie. The audience wasn't expecting such an amazing ending to the infinity saga. The movie has perfect amount of action, comedy, emotion and the flashbacks and the references to the previous MCU movies truly culminated the 11 years journey. The end of the saga couldn't have been better.",positive
"Avengers Endgame: ReviewBlockbusters like this only come once in a generation. After the epic Infinity War Marvel opted for a more melancholy film. One where the heroes we had connected to lost.The Characters:
Our characters are broken. Destroyed by their failures from the previous film and trying to cope with what happened. Each heroes coping mechanism is different and fallows the characterization all ready established in the other films. Building off what was already established in previous films.
For me Hawkeye is one of the best characters in the film. His ark is set up from scene one. He starts and what he believes as someone who is unredeemable. Then gets a shot at redemption and thinks he will sacrifices himself for the crimes he committed. Instead it was Natasha who ends up sacrificing herself. Now with this new found purpose to live and keep going. This is helped through Jermy Renners acting. His acting throughout helps create as strong emotional core of the film.Acting:
Similar to Infinity War the acting is top notch. Standouts are Karen Gillian as Nebula and Robert Downy Jr. as Iron Man. All the acting is great, from the comedic Thor, to the understated Black Widow who is trying to redeem herself in this new world.Direction:
Joe and Anthony Ruso had there work cut out for them. They directed the film exquisitely creating iconic shots and emotionally impacting moments. The film can do dramatic and make it interesting to look at and watch. The action as well is amazing and similar to the massive battles from Lord Of The Rings.Writing and Story:
If you spent at least 5 minutes on the internet after infinity war you probably saw someone's theory. Every theory out there was wrong but not better than the film we got (something that The Last Jedi suffered from in some peoples opinion).
The smart snappy comedy that the MCU is known for is throughout and helps make the films not all a depressing movie that isn't entertaining.
The writing also do great at subverting audience expectations. Going in a direction that wasn't expected. This is shown perfectly in the first few minutes. Everyone expects the heroes to use the stones and bring all the dead hero's back. Instead the heroes have to wait to get there redemption.Ending A Franchise:
Ending a series in a satisfying and fulfilling ending is hard. But when done right is magical. Look at Return Of The King the film was the end of the LOTR series in a satisfying way. Endgame does this to giving an ending to the story of Tony Stark and Steve Rodgers in a satisfying and conclusive ending. Bring the ending that no one expected and didn't feel rushed.Conclusion:
The film is a blockbuster of the highest caliber. One of both emotion and action bringing everything together in a satisfying conclusive way.Final Score:
11/10",positive
"This is a awesome movie with some great moments that had the whole theater fired up and cheering , little slow for the first 30 in the beginning but gets so exciting and doesn't feel Ike like a 3 hour movie. Take the family and go see it.",positive
"Except the unexpected. Expect tears, laughter, sorrow, pride and joy. It was amazing. Im still trying to recoup myself.",positive
"What can I say, there was no film this year that i was more excited about. The first two/two and half hours were perfection. I loved so many things but once it was over i felt a bit underwhelmed. It might have been due to the hype or my anticipation but i was left unsatisfied.It is also difficult to talk about this film without spoilers but Thor and Hulk were incredible and most definitely added to the comedy.RDjr and Chris Evans bring their A game and their performances are great!Don't walk into it hoping to see your favourite villain Thanos as he is sidelined for the majority of the picture. I don't see this as a negative though as this film is about the Avengers.Most will love the hell out of this film and i will certainly be seeing it again soon, but for the now, i'm not too sure how i feel about it.",positive
GREATEST SUPERHERO EVER F ALL TIME!!!!!! It doesn't disappoint!!!!!! Worth the HYPE!!!!!!,positive
"Inferior to Infinity war, nowhere in the same category. Felt plastic, rushed and untrue to most characters (looking at you Thor). All the 10/10 reviews are lazy, infantile or fake. Honestly, Winter Soldier, Civil War and Infinity War feel like they were done by a different group of people alltogether compared to this.Zero sense of grandeur or dignity in this.",positive
Please don't waste your time on this...Its very boring. It's like they pre-sell the movie with a good ending of infinity war. Its a rip off. Trust me you won't believe this. I quite after 30 minutes.I am writing this review to alert people: keep your money and time for something else.,negative

I think the rock-heart inhumans are disliking this movie and mr/ms hate I know your life can just spread hate so it's ok some inhumans are in the world.

"If you've been following Marcel cinematic universe for more than 5 years, this movie will probably become your favorite movie, it potentially can be one of the greatest movies of all times , so give your reviews !",positive
"Hmmmm I tried to go into the movie without high expectations, well as much as I could so I wouldn't say I was disappointed but it just wasn't was good as it could have been.Don't want to give anything away so this will be brief but the pluses are great action pieces, plenty of time with our favourite avengers and it ties up all the loose ends perfectly!The issues:
Its about an hour too long, takes way to long to get the motive and planning out the way before our hero's actually get about fixing the problem.Similar to Return of the King after the climax of the movie we spend far to long summing everything up and being all reflective.There are some odd character developments which feel a bit like Last Jedi type changes - hmm is it a Disney thing.It does struggle a bit to involve everyone at times - lacking the concise sharpness of many of the stand alone character movies.
Overall it is a good movie for sure it's just not as awesome as the likes of Black Panther, Ragnorok or Captain Marvel.",positive
"Historically speaking, the final movie of any movie series is either really good or really bad. Marvel Cinematic Universe with Avengers: Endgame - the end of an era - made the best look bad. It is one of the most satisfying movies ever.Captain America turns out to be worthy for Thor's Mjolnir and saves him mid-fight. This was important for Cap's character as he is the righteous person, but Thor's fans will feel bad at this.Endgame has been the best in every aspect but the time-travel related complexities. Marvel actually killed it by introducing a new time-travel timeline type, given that every other movie uses one of the conventional types. But they just skipped over some important details. We've seen dozens of minutes of screen-time spent on the birth of Vision and the Iron suit and the mini-arc reactor in the previous MCU movies, why not the time machine? This oversight in explaining the time travel bothers me. The whole infinity 'war' is 5 hrs long. This is a small setback, they should've gotten deeper into the time machine stuff.That 4-second Peggy Carter and Steve Rogers scene was one of the most pleasing things. I would LOVE to see more of Nat. But she's getting a film all about herself, and that settles things. Loki didn't return but we have already mourned for him.",positive
"-First of all I want to thank Stan Lee for the whole thing! and I also thank Marvel for making the movies .-This movie ends most of the story lines they have made so far for their characters.-Endgame has more sentimental scenes compared with Infinity war which got more actions and suspense; and I praise them both.-One thing that I don't like about Endgame is about Thanos. Writers should have gave him more chance. But after all Thanos finished his job in infinity war and he won!
P.S: Endgame was more like a ""Oh! Our heroes really lost?! We can't let that happen! We must find someway to let them win!""P.S.2: Nat sacrificed herself with no condition! She deserved at least a memorial! :'(",positive
"Last avengers movie like we knew it. And the everlasting boring one, trying the mange some drama that Neve happened??? Bad jokes... Time travel??? Really? Captain America picks Thor's hammer?
What happened to this movie??? Storyline mediocre... Disappointed and waste of time. 3 hours wasted.",negative
I have no words to describe the feeling about this way to end the journey,positive
"I mean this was conclusion of epic 22 Marvelous movie so I was expecting everything extraordinary in this movie ,though I like the story and superb acting specially by Thor ,
rest all were also superb but there was lacking of action sequence,I mean I can watch loads of action movie to fulfill my desire but the way Infinity war performed in every aspects, I was looking endgame extraordinary..",positive
"A good and must see movie for sure...
Altough i feel a mixed emotions about an overall look....maybe i will have to see it again.The caracter wheight importantance distribution is always difficult on a title gathering so many stars and key elements, and in some point i felted that 3 hour movie is little to explore the whole thing on every caracter.
So of realy important to say here, is action filled, with interesting twist and a conclusion of an epic challenge.For me a solid 8 for now .will see it again and re edit this review . For a true allthe way fan Go see it... the movie theatres still flooding to see this ..is a good sign",positive
"Alright.. this is my first review ever, so I hope I will be able to describe exactly what I want to you guys, because I think this piece deserves it.
This movie was huge. Talking about length, but even about content. It has three hours, but I can say you, are not bored for one minute. Every actor got time to show what they've got. So many things happen here, many expected, but also many we have no idea were coming.
When it comes to things I didn't like, they're basically just details.
Thor after revealing his funny side in Ragnarok had some really good lines.
Also we've lost good people.
Rest in peace.",positive
This movie was the perfect culmination of the past 10 years of story building for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The threads they have been weaving for the characters and their connections to each other. You take this journey with then and the time jump to 2023 fixes any future cinematic timeline issues moving forward lol.,positive
The Movie which tops every aspect and amazingly entertained us for 3 hrs...The set up of MCU makes an epic end to the endgame....WOW out of words.,positive
"I took my 6 year old, thought he was going to fall asleep. Love how Captain America is a grief counselor (sarcasm). I loved Infinity War- probably because it seemed like there were consequences, which god forbid any of these movies have any. It was a cop out, and it is what it is. I watched once and I'm good. Maybe I'll just pretend Infinity War was the last one.",positive
"If my friends want me to tell about this movie. I am gonna trhow'em with the strombreaker #DontSpoilTheEndgame. But if they ask how many tears that have fallen to the floor of the cinema, its 14,000,605 teardrops.",positive
"I'm a marvel fans but not a fanatic, the review i read so far more likely create by a fanatic...so i think i will review this movie based on my netral perspective...The good points:
THE ENDING SCENE, like Tony's said : the last 8-10 minutes was the best scene from the movie, i totally agree with that, it was THE BEST.The CGI, action scene, the relation reunion scene, the war scene was great like other marvel films, Perfect!!!But that's all... it was 3 hours movie i expect more than that, so i'll tell you the lack points from this movie :First, at the beginning of the movie, it's run too slow for me, it could be faster and make peoples hold breath or cry endlessly but it didn't, marvel tries to turn this movie to an emotional movie, but i just didn't get it, because i think the humor too much between the sad scene... marvel should more focus i think and i just get a little sad emotion at the ending and when the relation reunion at the past.Secondly, the role of captain marvel was too little, just pick up the iron man at the space??? destroy a ship and a little fight with thanos?? come on, i expect more she's the strongest heroes right??? hawkeye become an assassin again? please don't and don't make thor & hulk like a clown please, their appearance was disgusting me, they should be more frightening and strong than ever, not like that. In the movie, the best appearance just for captain america and iron man and avenger was not just for them.Third, at the beginning, Thanos die too easy by thor and at the final part they fight so hard to kill him (both was the same thanos without the stones), why???Fourth, nebula didn't die after the past nebula died, they in the same reality right? She should die i think and add some sad scene...that's my review, it could be better than this... overall it's still a good movie, but not great :)",positive
"The first 1.5 hr was suuuuper boooring. I ate all of my chips, food, chocolates, drink I was so bored....This guys couldn't decide for 5 yrs what to do, then in 2min this Iron Man found out everything.
I missed Wonder Woman A LOT and of course Aquaman...
Also I did not like the end! It was depressing, frustrating ..to see this good looking Captain guy old.. I waited after the last movie something delightful at the end..got the same bad feeling :/
This movie was disappointing for those who sometimes take a look behind the curtain:/",negative
"Endgame was an amazing movie there was a great story line to it and the characters played all their roles on point and better than ever before. The action and affects in the movie were great.

"Great comeback after infinity war. Bring all the dust back to life. Great story line, laughs, cry, claps all the audience. Great cinematic experience... love love love. Thank you for another great movie",positive
"Endgame is an enjoyable movie, that's for sure. But all the interest and depth of the first movie is gone. The main reason is the sacrifice of one of the best and most likeable (yes, likeable) villain of all times: ThanosIn the first movie, Thanos is complex. Ruthless but caring. Crazy strong but weak for his love of his daughter. And intelligent. We can FEEL and UNDERSTAND his motives and have some empathy for himIn this movie: all gone. He was just turned into a meaningless, overpowered bad guy till the end. Sacrificed for the fun of the movieThat plus the usual and very convenient time travel non sense makes the movie a big disappointment versus the first one",positive
"I am sorry if i have a bad grammar, i just want to make review for this amazing movie.
i think this movie is complete, the comedy, drama, romance, action, that's all in one movie. i laugh much than i ever do on other movie, i cried 2 times more than i ever do on other movie. I give my 10 stars for you all, the hero who made my life not flat anymore.and for the record, i think the story is unpredictable.",positive
"The balance it's positive, I love some thing, but the ruin one of the most emblematic chartacers of the world of comics, THOR, he is a GOD, and then they put it as an alcoholic, and obese homeless, seriously? . They broke this fantastic character, they ruin him. In infinity war he save the day as the GOD that he is.... And now this, seriously? Very bad decision! This was not necessary! At all!",positive
"I am glad, this kind of culminates superhero movies. At least i hope so. These kind of movies have robbed us of real cinema.",negative
"I mean this movie was just amazing.... from the deaths the characters endured, and how they persevered to come together and defeat Thanos. 10/10",positive
"The MCU movies have been not just about the storyline they portray. They were the last frontline of cinema in times of on demand tv shows, at least from my recent experiences at the movies in a rural area of Germany.
People setting alarm clocks for ticket sales and sitting through double/triple features after midnight, this is when movie magic really happens for me and I fear that this is the culmination and the end of this kind of cinematic culture. Nothing like this has been done before and it is uncertain if we will ever see such an epic journey of interwoven films again like this.This is a thank you to anyone involved in the creation of these film, since I am grateful for this experience and always was looking forward to the next chapter in this story. I hope there will be more stories like this to be told on the big screen, but I fear nothing will ever compare to the excitement before watching endgame in the midnight screening. This is what great moviemaking looks like and my wife and I laughed, cheered and cried along the way.
Thank you for this masterpiece!",positive
Perfect story and truly a good end after 22 films. I feel like if I hadn't seen all 22 films then I would have not known what was going on and I would have been lost. I also think Thanos could have been better in this and he is no where near as good of a character but I think that is because Avenger Infinity War was his story and this is more Iron man's and Captain America's. However it is still one of the best films in this time and it will be remembered for a long time as one of the greatest blockbusters of all time.,positive
No amount of word could describe this work of art.,positive
I didn't expect to see the things that happened when I went to the cinema so gotta give props for that but the only thing that truly disappointed me was tony dying so kind of a turn off but overall an amazing movie. I'm an adhd patient so it's literally impossible for me to sit through a movie that long but not once I started drifting off when the movie was playing!.,positive
I don't know what should I say.. Time travel in this movie has problem. But this is the best quality of this film,positive
In the Marvel Comics The X Men fought with Thanos not The Avengers.,positive
"Always the end of a series will be emotional apart from that, its perfectly delivered to the fans!! Its hard to guess what will happen next so each scene is well connected. If you all are waiting for a big war this is the movie!! Enjoy 😊",positive
"I am not a huge Marvel fan. I have watched some if the Avenger movies but not all.Basically, all I remember from it is that it was full of CGI explosions and scenes created via the same.What happened to actors acting? This entire movie was special effects with a few giggles.Three hours Wasted.",positive
"It was ok, but not anything spectacular. I mean, the story was doubtful and the puns were dusty... Thanos had the infinity glove specially made by the dwarves of a goodly universe, but Tony starks tech could magically handle the celestial power... come on...?!?!",negative
"For the closeup of the avengers movie, you can't find a better way. Get stick to your chair for for ride of your life.",positive
Absolutely incredible and creative movie. It takes risks beyond our minds and gives the fans a movie to enjoy.,positive
"I watch this movie today everything is good in this movie, but also have some unanswered questions which we didn't get....!",positive

"This film was much more than I expected, each scene, each dialogue, a remarkable and unforgettable MASTERPIECE",positive
How on earth did this average kind of movie managed to beat the AVATAR !!!!!!!,positive
"Infinity War is so much better. This movie felt so forced, too many eye rolling gags and a confusing plot. The way Thor and Hulk were handled is criminal.",negative
This movie is the payoff for 11 years of marvel movies and it wasn't disappointing. It still stands as one of the only three movies that have made me cry. The entire movie is handled so perfectly and the movie has one of the greatest finales of any action movie I've seen. Only problem its ThReE hOuRs LoNg!,positive
Captain marvel scenes at the beginning and captain marvel at the end when she saves everyone made this movie amazing.,positive
Started off slow but got better. Such a sad movie but still amazing.,positive
The best marvel movie to ever be created. The movie is visually stunning and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more and more. This movie will leave you in shock and tears.,positive
"I was recently introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe by my wife, who is a long time fan of superhero film and TV. Apart from the occasional Batman movie, superheroes never really interested me, but I am now a convert.
Taking the MCU in the context in which it is intended, as fun and family orientated entertainment, you can allow yourself to become immersed in its brilliance.
Endgame ties up the Avengers franchise perfectly, with three hours of excellent action and character interaction.
The movies starts with Deadeye/Clint Barton losing his entire family. A story line taken from the characters origin story. It is a very emotional piece of cinematography to start the movie and creates a human connection with Deadeye (played by Jeremy Renner) in his pain and eventual mission to bring his family back. Thanos is dispatched early in the film with a swift strike of Thor's axe-hammer. The movie then delves into a series of time travel events to try and undo the devastation Thanos brought to planet Earth. Of course, surprise surprise, our heroes are successful, after an incredible final battle which involves every hero of the MCU coming together. It is a wonderful sight to behold. But alas, what has been foreshadowed throughout the franchise, finally came to pass. The passing of Tony Stark. A sad moment for all Iron Man and Avengers fans, for sure. An epic money spinner? Yes of course. But nobody can deny it's value for money to entertainment ratio. Possibly the greatest super hero movie ever made and it will take something truly special to take that crown.",positive
"This is what the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been waiting for. The culmination of over 20 films in the span of 11 years telling the story of the Infinity Saga. Let me tell you that at the end of it all it was among the, in my opinion, best movies ever made. The first hour races into the story and begins the plot buildup, and although the second hour is slow, every mistake is made up for with the final hour. Such an epic battle scene ending the long, long story of the Avengers. I recommend everyone alive right now go see this movie at least once.",positive
"I'd like to start with I'm a great marvel fan and loved infinity war must have watched it about 20 times. Waiting all year for this film was hard and the excitement as I got ready to watch endgame was crazy. As a whole the story was good and we'll set out, but a few things did disappoint me. I'll start with hulk I thought they made is character weak and just not like the hulk we use to, hulk was suppose to be like a wild animal with no control yet in this film he's like the hulk out of a kids cartoon. Thor he played an amazing part in infinity was and at the start of this film he was still the Thor we like, but they turned him into an idiot, I get they wanted us to see all the characters giving up but they made him a joke, I get the film's are not 100% serious but they just destroyed him. There are some very good parts to the film that made me laugh and want to cry but I just don't feel they pulled it off as good as infinity war. Infinity war was amazing one of the best in my eyes and I was really hoping this film would be the same, maybe I need to watch it a few more times to appreciate it more I don't know.",positive
"Why so PC? Marvel was great. Invent new characters. Don't replace the existing like Captain Marvel being Miss Marvel (gender change). Now iron man is dead (gender change replacement), captain America ethnic change. Thor retired (gender change).It's ok to be a white male. Find new characters like black panther (which is good).",positive
"A good coverup of marvels fault of building a big lovable thanos. The fight sequence was like ""the screen is full of faces "" . Simply made to end the series.",positive
"Watched last evening on Blu-Ray and was quite disappointed. Should have streamed it for a lot less. What in the world is going on with the writers and producers these days. Plot was weak at best. Time Paradox was poorly done. Character development bordered on the ridiculous. Thor was made into a bumbling drunk idiot, Hulk was....I don't know, some kind of a cross between Banner/Hulk working in a diner, and was nearly useless like in Infinity Wars, Captain American now has and can wields Thors' hammer. What in the world is going on! This unfortunate change started surface with Infinity Wars. They also made sure all the politically correct stuff was jammed right in there. The first two remain the best, don't even bother with the others. Sad!!",negative
This film ticked all of my boxes as far as I'm concerned. I feel like although certain questions remain unanswered the writers and directors of this movie have done the best that they could with the material they were given to create an entertaining movie with a lasting effect on its fan base.,positive
"Warning: Spoilers ahead!I have two major criticisms about Avengers Endgame that I call the ""Thanos Problem"". These are:1) In Infinity War, a very serious question was asked: what should be done about overpopulation and the increasing fight for limited resources? Thanos's answer was to wipe out half of all sentient life. It is very easy to see on how many different levels this answer is flawed. In this movie, Avengers Endgame, the heroes had their own opportunity, after acquiring all the infinity stones again to address this problem in a more constructive way. It was possible for them to literally do ANYTHING they wanted to make the world a better place. With just a snap of their fingers, they could have eradicated poverty and diseases, yet they did nothing with this power. Even if that is too much, they still could have started to change the world for the better, before for example the stones would power down, and show us how much good they did. It could have been so uplifting. But no, they need to bring the stones back right away where each of them belonged.2) My other major criticism is about the character of Thanos. In Infinity War, we saw a unique villain, who had emotions and was a much more complex villain than what we usually get. In this film, Endgame, we don't see the emotional side of Thanos at all, he is reverted back to the usual one-dimensional villain. They could have explored the human side of his character a bit more for example his relationship with his daughter. If they really wanted to bring back a dead character, why not bring back Gamora, which would allow this rediscovery of Thanos's human side to evolve? She could have been teleported out before dying by the mysterious force that required a sacrifice for exchange of the Soul Stone. Then, linking up with the Avengers, they could have devised a plan to find Thanos, and convince him that what he did to the world was wrong. This could have been done by exploiting his love for his daughter, and making him see that he took away the daughters and sons of so many, who all suffer, just as he did when he lost Gamora. After realizing this, he would correct his thinking and restore everyone thus providing a substantial character development to him and give him the proper ending he deserved (as opposed to being beheaded by Thor while unarmed).The humor and visual effects are excellent, but I was expecting more from the story and buildup of the previous film.",positive
"This movie is an experience that you feel like is the one of your life. Some questions from last movie are answered, new clues. Just amazing.",positive
"Everything was perfect in this movie, the reunion scenes, the integration scenes,t he fight scenes,although there was a plot hole regarding time travel but it can be negotiated when you are watching a movie like this.",positive
Loved every second so much that I went to see it at the cinema 3 times in the space of 3 weeks from the date it was first released :D.,positive
A movie that has everything a marvel fan can want or expect the movie is wonderfull in terms of everything you will laugh you will wonder you will cry and in the end you will be amazed.,positive
"The movie is like a volcano, waiting for the fire to arrive and you feel bored, but the end definitely changes your mind",positive
A movie worth watching. If you have a busy schedule them too give 3 hours for this movie.,positive
"It was not what we expected at all, so so overrated and too long! It could have been 30-40min shorter, and the story was so messy.",positive
"Good things about this movie:
1. Nostalgia
2. Visuals
3. Score
4. Everything Scarlett Witch did
5. Tony with his daughter
6. Cap being worthy of mjolnirBad things about this movie:
.... pretty much everything that isn't stated above. Like,...
1. Story (Generic superhero stuff, nothing special about this movie. Relies heavily on the nostalgia factor)
2. Plot (It has so many plot holes that if I try to write them all down, it would take me a whole day to get through. Everything that is directly or indirectly related to time travel in this movie is just so wrong)
3. Character development (I didn't say characters, I said character development. Please try to understand the difference. Steve and Tony don't go through any permanent physical or psychological transformation until the very end. Fat Thor sucks in this movie. It's as lame as Nick Fury losing his eye to cat scratch. That's just unforgivable. I'm okay with professor hulk though)
4. Jokes (This movie should not have most of those jokes. That just ruins the seriousness and desperation of avengers' mission)
5. Social commentary (probably because of my own biased view on some issues)
6. Supporting characters (boring. Used only for exposition or quipping unfunny jokes in a serious situation)
7. Logical explanation of time travel theory ( I hate the fact that changing the past doesn't change the future. It just takes away the stakes that this movie is supposed to have. It's one of the worst example of lazy writing since The Last Jedi)
8. Tension building ( we already Know that Avengers will win because it's the final movie in the MCU. There was no creativity to how the avengers defeated Thanos. Iron Man builds a gauntlet that can snatch the stones from other gauntlets and harness it's powers. It was so lame)
9. Captain Marvel ( How can she breathe in space without her helmet that she wore in her solo movie? Was that just for show? Is she like Zombie Superman Princess Leia from The Last Jedi? I'm really glad that Tree Larson with her wooden plank face got less than 15 minutes of screen time)
10. Rescue (How and when did Pepper Potts learn to use the Rescue suit? )
11. Valkyrie (Where did Valkyrie got her Pegasus from? Weren't they all killed by Hela in Ragnarok? And why did Thor make her the queen of Asgardians? What makes her a worthy leader? They never showed us why she would be a better leader than Thor. When we first saw Valkyrie in Ragnarok, she was more depressed and broken down than Thor in Endgame. At least Thor didn't give up on his people like she did in her first movie)
12. Gamora (what was the point of showing little gamora and Thanos scene at the end of infinity war? Now gamora being her past self and not having any chemistry with the guardians ruins her character arc in previous two Guardians of the Galaxy movies)
13. Thanos (In infinity war Thanos was a menacing yet sympathetic villain, but in Endgame he's just another boring forgettable generic MCU villain like Malekith from The Dark World. It was a massive let down)
Spiderman (He's just a coward now. In infinity war he was brave enough to take on black order and not listening to Tony. He even defeated Ebony Maw using his brain and saved Doctor Strange's life. Now he just hides behind women's back, among them some have less experience in fighting than him)
14. Time travel suit (if time travel can't be done without quantum realm suits, how the hell did Thanos brought his whole army and himself into the future without such suits? They never showed us Ebony Maw using Pym particles for creating time machine.
15. Nebula (I wanted nebula to have more important role than she got. She's got a lot of screen time. But the interaction she has with other characters, except the ones with Tony in space, are kind of stupid and predictable)
16. The Ancient one (In doctor strange 2016 she was hesitant to teach strange because she thought he too would end up like keicillius. But in this movie which takes place in 2012 timeline, she is saying that strange is supposed to be the best among them. If that wasn't stupid enough, then just think how the hell did she know that strange would be the best sorcerer when she said that she can't see past her own death in 2016, and she died in that movie before strange defeated doormammu)
17. Mantis (what is her purpose in this movie? When all female MCU character came together to defeat Thanos, she just gave an awkward pose. That's it)
18. Hawkeye ( The whole thing in Japan didn't make sense to me. Like, what is he even doing there and why? How did Natasha find him? What happened to the spaceship that rocket gave him before time travel? Why didn't he use that in final battle against Thanos?)
19. Black widow ( she did not have a character arc like most other avengers. She's just there to sacrifice herself for the soul stone. It would have been more emotional if they had build up her relationship with Clint in a meaningful way instead of teasing about some Budapest incident audience know nothing about in Two movies and not showing us anything. In infinity war Gamora's death was tragic because they had shown us the father-daughter relationship between her and Thanos and how they care for one another. We didn't get that with Clint and Natasha. Her relationship with Cap, Tony and Banner got more screen time and had more depth than with Hawkeye. So, the whole scene in Vormir was not as emotional as Gamora's death in infinity war)
20. Rocket (how the hell did he got the reality stone from Jane? Since we know from Thor 2 that the aether can defend itself from any attacker. Even Odin and the Asgardians couldn't get it out of her body. How did rocket do it? With a taser? How did he turn aether into stone?)........
If I touch the subject of Time travel in this movie, the review would be 10x longer than this. All I can say here is that it's dumb. Seriously, who is giving this film 10 stars?",negative
"Every Avenger Fan was waiting for this movie. finally I watched it and lot of craze was seen in theatres. You will find the same amazing style and power show of Thanos and Avengers. Story is fine till last it does not open up how and who will kill Thanos. You might be able to guess or not about climax.
This movie will give you goosebumps sometimes but I think final fight scene was stretchable instead of streatching first half or because of story line makes it a long movie there was a possibility to make two parts of this movie cause story definitely needed that.",positive
"Wow it's so amazing. I didn't expect in the final battle. This movie makes me want to cry. No much word to say or spoiler from me, you must see with your eyes.",positive
"It is everything a Mavel fan would want. It got its comedy, epic battles, and a fair part of emotions. It gave a epic ending for all connected 22 Marvel movies. Thank you Stan Lee and Marvel Studios for this movie",positive
"Overall, I think it was a great way to wrap everything up. I personally think it took a while for everything to get up to speed, but once it did is was very entertaining. That is the main reason why I think infinity war was better honestly, infinity war never really slowed down. Saying that Thor made the movie worth watching for me. The hulk is not the hulk anymore, he's basically beast from X men. The hulk is supposed to be unpredictable and destructive. They turned him into a genius gorilla. Wish the guardians played a bigger part personally but I understand why they didn't. Great final battle scene and the ending that ultimately needed to happen. Definitely worth the watch",positive
"Had everything you could ever want from a film, emotion, comedy an amazing way to tie up some historical storylines",positive
This movie marks a end of an era. No movie studie could do what marvel did. Some cheesy scenes but overall a great movie. Especially the end fight. That was so epic. I could see it a hundred time and not getting bored. Good ending. Good story arch.,positive
Ok guys...poor writing..so many plotholes...all messed with the time but nothing changed..i was givin it 5 max but hey....yes in memory of Stan Lee..,positive
There is no way to describe how amazing this film is!! All you can do is watch this yourself and experience this massive epic !,positive
"A good watch, but very long, serious and hard on my brain. Expert commentary from my daughter helped.",positive
"It was underwhelming. I guess I had expectations for it, some people hyped it up too much. Infinity was better.",negative
"This is the BEST LIKE LEGIT BEST MOVIE,GO WATCH IT,3HRS SO BUY EXTRA POPCORNS,Movie Very Interesting And story was ""sweetttt"" Perfect for small Kids aged 8 Above to watch!!",positive
I cant talk much about this movie ...It was just too good,positive
Wow it's hands down the best movie I've ever seen....... nothing has been close to this it will make you laugh and cry. Just amazing from start to finish. Nothing will prepare you for it,positive
Even better the 2nd time watching this long movie! It has EVERYTHING I ever wanted to see in a super hero flick!!! I did hope that they brought in other existing Marvel characters; but I understand why they decided not to... This flick had all movie genres rolled into one! GENIUS linking all these movies together!!! Definitely a 10 star flick!!!,positive
"My interest in Marvel was because of the character of Natasha and Steve Rogers.In my opinion, without Captain America, Marvel will lose viewers.",positive

Even if you can't afford it, just sell your kidney it's worth it believe me.",positive
"In the 70's, I grew up watching Spider Man and reading X-Men. They were groovy. Fast forward to 2008, and I saw Ironman, a character I couldn't care less about. I met my soon-to-be-wife, and she got me more involved with the MCU, and over the next several years, I backfilled my knowledge and interest into this wondrous fantasyland, eventually even caring about Captain America, who I cared even less about than Ironman.RDJ and Evans breathed humanity into their characters, as well as the rest of the tangential family I grew to appreciate and applaud. Marvel certainly had the right formula to rope me in, and care about the characters, which is the most important element of any story. The audience has to care about the characters. Even Thanos, complicated, merciless, driven and yet, somewhat understandable. Marvel did a brilliant job at sucking me into their Universe.And this all led up to Endgame. The title itself should have been a red flag. The very name of the movie signified...well...it's over. I mean, there wasn't a person on Earth who didn't know Ironman's fate. It was not a surprise or even a faint twist. He and Cap had run their course, and we were all well aware they had fulfilled their contractual obligations. We all knew it was death or retirement for most of the original Heroes.So, then. Marvel delivered exactly what had to be delivered, and nothing more. We got highs and lows. We got humor. We got drama. But we got no suspense. Everything played out exactly as it was supposed to, except it was egregiously padded with about an hour of slow, plodding, forced sentimentality.Do you know know what Ironman dying means? That's right, another 35 minutes of dull, agonizingly slow dolly shots heaped on top of the other hour of desperately boring scenes we already endured. Don't worry, though, we'll have a lifetime of Tony Stark's holographic lectures to listen to. Even in death, he wouldn't shut up.Aside from that, the deus ex machina provided by Capt'n Marvel, for whom an entire movie had to be filmed for the purpose of shoehorning her into the final battle, was an unnecessary message that ""Women are just as tough as men."" Thanks. We already knew that. Disney has a perpetual hard-on for lecturing us on things we already believe. I never doubted women are just as strong, if not stronger than men, as evidenced by my mom and step-mom.In fact, she should have ended the battle with her cavalcade of girls right then. She demonstrated she was more powerful than anyone else...but the Russo brothers didn't have the resolution we have, and were compelled to let her bungle it, and allow each Hero have a shot at haplessly reclaiming the bouncing glove, ricocheting nimbly out of each person's hand, extending an already painfully long battle even longer.All this, and Dr. Strange was just a second-tier afterthought, when it would have been much more compelling had he been hiding in the mirror dimension ready to unleash the Forces of the resurrected, to crush Thanos. That would have been too clever, the Russo brothers concluded, for the viewing audience.Finally, the last act Ironman performs, while struggling to complete a snap with the gauntlet, has his hand in A PERFECT POSITION TO GIVE THANOS THE FINGER, but instead declares with meek determination: ""i am ironman.""Other than that, great, mindless fun. The people who thought this was the greatest 11/10 movie of all time, full of awesomeness, wild feels and major sadface, are obviously children.",positive
"Amazing film, and definitely worth watching. The pace was slower, but there was a lot of story building. I would rather that they built a story than to leave me guessing.
However, I felt there was a little more emotional depth than I expected from a superhero movie... Not sure that I am complaining.
Will definitely watch this one again! It was EPIC!",positive
"I don't review movies often (if at all). But for this one, I'll make an exception.
For all I know, maybe no one will read my review anyway, but here it is.People cheering for this movie, calling it perfect don't really seem to see past the ending.
The ending is good, but not great - the emotional impact wasn't really there for me. To explain why would potentially lead into spoilers, so I can't for now.
However what ultimately brings the movie down for me are the plot holes of which there are many...
I don't know how to explain more without going into examples/spoilers, so you would have to take my word for it...
Also working against the film is it's runtime and it's pacing. It starts out very slow and at the end feels like a roller coaster going down after reaching the peak. There are a million things on screen to the point of fatigue and it starts feeling like visual noise...Overall it's still a good movie, but I personally would like to watch it in privacy without a hundred or more teenagers making my head explode... So if you can, seek out a showing with the least amount of filled seats. ;)",positive
"Horrible, terrible, stupid. All the bad names you could call a movie should be directed at this one.It's a pathetic excuse of a movie. It was cool having Guardians of the Galaxy in it, but even their humor and coolness was muted quite substantially.Why am I still even writing about this...",negative
"It is one of the films that you must see before death. After that you can stare to somewhere and say, well, it has everything, yes i expected more but it had everything which it must have.",positive
"A cinematic masterpiece ,an allrounder.a movie which will be remembered for a very long time.",positive
"Let me just get started, this is the best mcu movie ever made. Started off a bit slow but after the first hour I started jizzing everywhere. Understanding the movie by watching all the previous ones makes the movie just way better. Thor had a massive role in infinity war and did a lot of work, so it would be unfair if he did everything in this film. When you break the movie down every character played a significant role, and was played perfectly. When captain America held mjlonir I literally started shaking. And the last fight between thanos and the avengers is the nets fight scene in superhero history. There is no post credit scene as it is the end of a huge story. I'm so glad I got to life during the time of the mcu and live my life to the fullest",positive
Wonderful film I don't know how to describe❤Graphicand effects everything wow❤,positive
I was never so thoroughly entertained by any movie or story before as I have been by Infinity War and Endgame. I was on the edge of my seat for every viewing and don't believe any movie cliffhanger could ever be better than this pair. MARVEL is my goto. Thanks for this!! ❤❤❤❤❤,positive
"When the final scene was over, I couldn't help but think that Stan Lee is up there looking down at his masterpiece. He created an entire new universe and today I watched Endgame. The first hour was not very good and I didn't like the idea of time travel. The movie just doesn't work and there are a lot of holes that aren't filled. But the fight at the end changed everything when all the lost ones came back. My rating is not about the special effects or the acting. My rating is 10 out of 10 because Stan Lee, Marvel Studios and the Russo brothers deserved it. Wow. When you watch a movie like that and just think about the 10 years that lead up to this moment, you have to rate it pretty high.",positive
"-1 for breaking their own in-universe rules: a gauntlet that gives someone ""all power"" to do ""anything they want"" according to canon, could also bring back those killed for the soul stone; furthermore, the characters searching for the soul stone already HAD sacrificed what they loved the most, which is why they were there in the first place. -1 for killing Iron Man in the fashion they did-extremely wrong compared to the comics. Finally, the 3rd lost star is from them not having our heroes go back and grab past versions of the now-dead characters that were temporally close (example: going back to 5 minutes before Black Widow jumps and taking her to the future that is ""won""), since ""Dragon Ball"" time travelling rules are in play, this would easily work. I almost took away another star for them not having a post-credit scene until watching a video confirming that there were ""post-credit-like morsels"" within the movie itself.",positive

The universe is in ruins. With the remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe.
The culmination of 10 years and 22 films. The most comprehensive mythological ever presented on the screen, an incredible range of world-class talent, and all the rest. This is the ""end of the road"" Tony started us on.MY OPINION:Story:
We never see our heroes like this in any other Marvel film. They know they lost and they know that they can't do anything to reverse what happened in Infinity War. As an audience, you really feel the emotion of loss of hope.Everybody is in a different location, Iron Man is trapped in space with Nebula while Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, and other fellow Avengers are in the Avenger tower.First of all, I love this movie, but at the same time, like all the other movies in the Marvel Universe, it has the same flaws.
This is a 3-hour long movie and they made a great job balancing all the character and action moments. Phasing sometimes is a little off, but that's okay because it doesn't distance you out from the movie.
In the beginning, Captain Marvel saves Tony Stark in the first 10 minutes of the movie and that to me is just lazy writing. It was too fast and it doesn't give you the time to acknowledge that these characters are in real danger. Another issue that I have with this movie is that Ant-Man is saved by a rat. I don't know whose idea that was, but we had some theories of how Ant-Man could return from the quantum realm and is this really what they gave us? We're supposed to believe that Ant-Man is saved by a rat. I just don't buy this stuff in movies.Characters:Let's talk about characters since this movie is heavily about the story and character ark. Characters are always brilliantly written and balanced throughout the whole film. They took some risks with two characters which could have turned out pretty bad, but somehow they managed to find the perfect way to do it. Of course, I'm talking about Thor and Hulk ( Bruce Banner ). I loved both of the characters. What they have changed felt quite ambitious and hilarious, although I sometimes miss the old Hulk smashing things like the good old days.
This film is heavily focused on Iron Man ( Tony Stark ) and Captain America ( Steve Rogers ). What they have done with these two characters is just wonderful and brilliant. In the beginning, you feel the tension between these two characters because of what happened in the Civil War. One of Tony's iconic line this movie proposed was "" I love you 3000 "" which added this film something special. Considering how Hawkeye's relationship with his daughter was described, this line emphasized it all perfectly. Tony's sacrifice at the end when he took all the infinity stones and snapped his finger killing Thanos and his army was very well done. And Tony's final line "" I AM IRON MAN "" added another layer of emotion to that moment. His final line is a reference to the very first Iron Man film that created this huge universe. Marvel finds the perfect way to end Tony's ark and it couldn't be any better. His monologue at the end was so meaningful and precious. In the end, as an audience, you understand and admit that this is the end of the Iron Man storyline.Captain America's story arc didn't fall behind Iron Man's in any manner. In this movie, Marvel finds a perfect way to end Captain America's ark. In the beginning, he is hopeless like all the fellow Avengers. He adds this film so much heart and emotion. At the final battle, we saw Captain America hold the Mjollnir which was an awesome moment. We saw Captain America move Mjholiner a little bit in Avengers: Age of Ultron and it was even better to see Captain America finally lift and hold Mjollnir which proves that he is finally worthy. After Hulk snapped and got every hero back in action Captain America says "" AVENGERS ASSEMBLE "", this moment was something to be experienced. After the final battle, Captain America had to bring the stones back to fix different timelines. After that, we are seeing old Captain America which left us confused, but soon after that, we learn that after he puts the stones back to their original locations, he lived his full life with his only love Agent Carter. When he finally returns as an old man back to his timeline, he gives his shield to Falcon when everyone thought it was gonna be Bucky, but I thought it was a great moment between Captain America and Falcon. The movie ends with Captain America and Agent Carter dancing in the past which was a reference to the first Captain America film similar to the reference mentioned about Iron Man earlier. It was a great ending for Captain America's character ark. It couldn't end any better. It was a wonderful and bittersweet ending.Time Travel:Now it's the time for the main concept that everyone is talking about, which is time travel.
This is not an ordinary time travel film like Back to the Future. At the beginning of this film, we find out that Thanos used the stones again on another planet. Our heroes are once more going to try to get the stones from Thanos, but when they arrive they are learning that Thanos used the stones to destroy the stones. Then the film cuts to five years later...
Our heroes are desperate and try to move on some do, but not them. All of a sudden Ant-Man appears and talks about the possibilities of time travel. After Tony changes his decision and joins the team again for the possibilities of time travel. After they find out how time travel works they are going back in time and the movie turns into a time heist.Time travel is a risky thing to do in any movie because it has science behind it and if you change the rules of time travel people will judge every little thing, in the end, it could be a bad choice for your film. In this film, they change the rules and not everything makes sense, but after they explained how it works in this universe it started to makes more sense. This is a superhero movie after all not everything will going to make sense and that's okay. After they went back on time the movie shines and we as an audience are experiencing the old MCU films once again which was an awesome moment to experience in the theater. Our heroes are traveling different timelines through MCU the reason is they are trying to restore the stones before Thanos for the sake of the universe. Hawkeye and Natasha went to Vormir to get the soul stone, but they didn't know the requirements for the soul stone. Then we as audience witnessing the terrible event that happened to Natasha aka Black Widdow. She sacrifices herself for the soul stone which was a shocking moment that I didn't see coming. After all, this is a fun, ambitious, different and emotional time heist superhero film.CONCLUSION:In the end, this is a brilliantly written, well-directed and well-acted action-packed superhero film that fans were waiting for. Sometimes passing is little off and there are some lazy moments and not all the time travel stuff makes sense, but as a whole, it just works and creates a whole different superhero experience for the audience. I love this movie and every superhero fan will enjoy this movie. This is the end of the journey Tony had started us on and it ended beautifully.Rating: 9/10",positive
"Great film, some sentimental scenes, terrific action, a fitting end to the saga, but time travel always complicates movies doesn't it..Am I wrong or...If Nebula brings Thanos forward in time from before he finds the stones, and he is still searching for the stones and tries so hard to get his hands on the 'new' gauntlet, surely that means everything in the previous film never happens??
So when he arrives everyone who vanished 5yrs ago should still be there and there is no need for Hulk to do the snap??Anyway, loved it, gutted for some of the deaths, but end of an era!!!",positive
Yes I reviewed this already but people giving this movie less than 9 obviously aren't vested in these characters and are just to anti marvel to see just how good this movie was..... as far as being any kind realistic the movie starts with dear Mr fantasy.....,positive
"This movie has a half-dozen amazing scenes, a dozen great lines and two dozen great moments. But, it left me unfulfilled. First, the great. The elevator scene is one of the best in all the Marvel movies. Captain America using his cleverness to outwit Hydra. The fight against his younger self is great too. As is the hammer moment. Peter getting knocked out by Nebula and War Machine was hilarious. The opening scene with Hawkeye was a punch to the gut. The moment where all the heroes return near the end is overwhelming. There are other moments that really shine. I found myself Involuntarily clapping many times.But, the movie fails to deliver satisfying conclusions to most of its characters. Turns out Cap never sacrificed anything at all in the end. He lived 70 years with the woman he loved. All while leaving Bucky to be tortured (not to mention sitting idly by while numerous other atrocities occurred).
Kids, it's also cool to play video games all day and leave your responsibilities. Even if you have god like powers and people rely on you and hope for better days. You do you, and put someone else in charge so that you can do the hard work of threatening little kids on Fortnite. You know, the real important things in life.
Speaking of life, the soul stone requires an ""everlasting"" sacrifice of what you love. Except it doesn't. No one dies in the MCU. Not for long anyway. Why morn the loss of Loki for the third time. He's alive, duh. Why give vision and Black Widow a funeral, or wake or at least a eulogy? They didn't. The film does not care about these two characters deaths. Why should the audience.
And are they really dead? Just go back in time with the Pym particles anytime you want and, poof, they're alive. You could visit anytime you want to. Iron Man saw his dad. Hawkeye heard his daughter's voice. And that half of the Universe thing. No worries, they are all alive. In the end, all the bad guys dies and three Avengers.But, those three Avengers will stay dead for how long?
Does anyone seriously think they are really dead? As in forever? Or course not. In five years, all three of them will be in a Marvel movie again. So don't cry too hard, no one dies forever (in the MCU that is).",positive
Absolutely speecheless. Magnificant. Go watch now!,positive
"This might be the best movie of the year for me. Tons of great films this year but none of them has impacted me like this one did. This is by far the greatest MCU film and it'll probably always be. I loved everyone's performance, yes even Brie Larson's, I loved the visuals and I really  loved the sound design, soundtrack and just the movie in general. 10/10 easy.",positive
"The thing that the writers and editors did so well in Infinity War was splicing all the mini subplots together. It was written and directed so well that it didn't feel disjointed or clunky. Endgame tried to do the same and failed. There were some plot holes and clucky awkward scenes with strange pacing. There were too many pop-culture references which is lazy writing and the jokes came off half-assed.
The plot itself wasn't about beating Thanos and restoring peace, it was more concerned with tieing up all the little plot ends for each character. Which became tiresome by the 3rd act. When the war broke in the 3rd act it felt like it had already been done in Infinity War. Apart from the restored characters (which was nice) it felt like they were showing that scene for the sake of it. Oh here's another battle, let's go kick some ass! rolls eyes... The message was clear; war, bad... We're all stronger together, if we put aside our differences and stand together we're better than the sum of our parts. Which is why it was confusing at the height of the battle the men and women were shown succeeding separately instead of teams working together. Which is quite relevant in today's political climate.
The ending was nice even if it was an easy way to finish it. What's better than a hero? A dead hero... As cynical as that may sound, the ending with Tony Starck narrating through the ending was a nice touch to the end of an epic era.
Now I'll have to rewatch them all from the first one, where it all began, inside of a cave...",positive
I really love Iron man 3000. He was best superhero in MCU,positive
"Such a poor movie, I'm still fuming. The two brothers who made this movie should get arrested and never allowed to film anything anymore.",positive
None of the rules presented in movie makes sense. Bad movie in regards to final conclusion,negative
Though Stan Lee's cameo could've been better. Nuff Said! Excelsior!!! ;),positive
"Watching movie took me back to the feeling I got while watching the first Spiderman as a 6 year old boy in 2002. Me and my friends who ofcourse watched all movies watched Endgame today and we all cried. We cried out of happiness, we cried out of sadness, we cried because the story was beautiful. I would strongly recommend this movie to literally everyone whove seen the marvel movies, you will absolutely not regret it. I would watch this movie again, anytime.",positive
"The movie isn't about fight but it's about the struggle they have made for each other and the familys who have been vanished. And they actually did ""whatever it takes""",positive
I can't top the other reviews apart from this is truly fantastic and worth every penny to go see in the iMax 3D...never thought it would be possible to shed a tear at the end of a Marvel film..,positive
"This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made in history. The Russo Brothers did an amazing job on writing this movie. The movie was a great ending for the Infinity Saga, a lot of surprises throughout the whole movie. Not gonna spoil it for those who haven't watched it, but for those who have they will agree that this is the greatest and saddest movie in the MCU. The only thing that I wish was a little better was the whole time travel situation, but other than that the whole movie was a phenomenon.",positive
One of the most awaited movie is finally here and it lives uoto the expectations and does not disappoint at all,positive
"Endgame is a good movie which should be rated somewhere around 6 or at best 7. But, unfortunately we have started judging/rating superhero on weird parameters.Bad is okay
Okay is good
Good is excellentWe have to stop doing this. An enjoyable movie which is sometimes a bit boring: 6/10",positive
Just AMAZING AMAZING AMAZINGLY TALENTED GUYS WHO ARE THE ONLY REASON FOR THIS ONE I THINK I WILL BE GOING BACK,positive
"A Modern Day Ben-Hur.
I have no words without spoiling it.
Just go.",positive
"Overwhelmingly boring!!! Thanos the farmer, really? This is a soap opera!! Don't waste your time and money watching this BAD JOKE!!",negative
"The story that has been culminating for the last 11 years has come to a satisfying end. The characters had their due and progressed out of phase 3 gracefully and purposefully. The characters i speak of had the end that they all deserved and what i thought was expected. i know these characters from the books really well and they behaved true to form on all fronts. Nothing really seemed forced and it felt like a natural progression. That being said the story was EPIC and yet it seemed everyone that needed it had their screen time which is a master stroke and very difficult to do but the Russo's pulled it off. My wife welled up with tears Three time and she never does this at movies let alone a comic book movie. She turned to me and said ""what is wrong with me i am about the cry again"" to this I just smiled. MY WIFE CRIED IN A COMIC BOOK MOVIE. 'NUFF SAID !",positive
"Just seen this. Reading some reviews on here before going to the cinema had me worried but I personally give it a thumbs up. Infinity war is still my favourite but this film was necessary to end the story. The 3 hours flew by which is a good indication that the story telling was good.Many people reviewing on here made it sound like there were flaws and holes in the story but I disagree. Time travel films are always complex and how can anyone argue over a fantasy that is probably not possible anyway. After all, nobody knows whether you would disappear like Marty Mcfly if you were to change your history, do they?This film is not just closure of the Thanos story but it is also closure for the back storys of some of the main characters.",positive
You know when I saw this I was sad but I guess everyone was tired of doing these movies,positive
This made a decade of going to the movies worth it. I couldn't find the part with AC Slater the first time I watched it. So I watched it again. It's the only movie I have seen in years that holds a candle to the unauthorized saved by the bell story.,positive
"I walked out of the cinema and rode home on my bike. It was raining outside - oh how poetic - and I had a smile on my face. In the next moment I had tears in my eyes. Then I was smiling again.
Funny, what a movie can do to you.
In that moment I felt infinitely grateful to be born in this time. I mean, I could have been born around 1600. I would have had the chance to watch Shakespeare plays live. But I'm pretty happy to watch what must be todays equivalent of a Shakespeare play. I just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece. But not just that. I had the feeling I just experienced a final step and the end of an era.If you think Infinity War was overwhelming in it's quantity of superheroes in one place, then, oh boy, you've no idea what's coming for you. You think you're prepared for this movie? Think again, you're not.
Endgame is a new level.
In some regards it's more of an Avengers movie than the previous one. We're very limited in our assembly of heroes. It really focuses on our beloved six.Clint got a rogue makeover. The scene where he lost his family was really heartbreaking. You can understand his motives. He's clearly in distress. He needs to be woken up by Natasha to get onto the right path, again. But when he's awake Hawkeye is the hero that we once met.Natashas development from deadly assassin who works for scrupulous leaders to a leader who holds her new found family together and sacrifices herself to protect this family is one of the most incredible character arches to watch. Truth be told I never expected her to be the sacrificing one.
The MCU lost its greatest badass. Black Widow, I'm going to miss you.Thor! Please, get back into shape. I mean think of all the fun Loki would be making of you if he could see you! Brother, have you swallowed a planet? (Well, Loki is still dead, but he still managed to steel some moments in the true God of Mischief fashion. Wherever you are I hope the sun is shining on you and could you please not be dead? That would be great, thank you! I mean really, you have to be alive - somehow. Are you sure you checked that you really don't have a heartbeat?) Thor is the one who takes the finger snap the hardest and drowns his sorrows in alcohol which shows in his not so fit form than what we're used to. It's one of the funniest aspects of the whole movie. In general this movie is not just epic, it's funny in moments that are totally serious. With a little bit of mummys help you got yourself together again.
You couldn't resist, could you? You just had to get Mjölnir back.
The decision to join the Guardians of the Galaxy... oh how much potential I see.No Hulk in the last movie, therefore more Hulk in this one. A very different Hulk. I think Bruce Banner did something, that nobody expected. He accepted the Hulk as something that is a part of himself. Not as the green rage monster, but as something that isn't a mistake but a gift. A great massage: accept your faults and turn them into something beautiful. Embrace them and be proud.Captain America, you fought Red Skull, you fought Iron Man, you fought Thanos and now you fought yourself. Now you're worthy enough to wield Mjölnir. Truth be told it was the most beautiful and epic moment of my fangirl life to watch you pick up that hammer. It's a moment that I'll never forget. You're worthy of another big part of a heroes life. After years of fighting and suffering you're finally worthy enough to get your happy end. Steve, I'm so unbelievably happy for you and Peggy. You gave your shield to Sam. America, you have a new Captain.
Sam, be sure, we will follow you to the end of the line.Iron Man, to be honest I didn't like you when I first watched Iron Man. With time you grew on me. Now I can't imagine the MCU without you. But sadly it's a thought that we all have to live with. You're the beginning and the end of the whole infinity saga. You're the heart of the Avengers. Now more than ever.
And you invented time travel. Which definitely makes you the coolest Avenger.
Tony Stark, who gained the most after Thanos finger snap and lost the most while attempting to undo it. We should all pay our respect to the genius, billionaire, playboy (now married and the father of one daughter) and philanthropist that was Tony Stark.
Tony, I assure you, we will remember you.One in particular will do that.
Guess who's back? Spider Man!
And everybody else!
But most importantly Spider Man! You had like what? Three minutes of screen time? It's an accomplishment that you managed to leave tears in my eyes nearly every time I saw you. Especially your reunion with Tony was a moment of genuin happiness. The moment of your goodbye was a moment of genuine sadness.
Seeing you again... that was nice. Thank you for coming back, I guess. You can make all the tears up to me with a hell of a movie in July this year.Ladies and gentleman, it seems the superhero business finally understood that women can kick ass just as well as man. The symbolic act of gathering every female character together in one scene and let them kick Thanos in his purple behind, should be an eyeopener. Beware, everybody who lives under a rock and thinks a woman belongs in a kitchen, there are woman out there with brains and skills you could never imagine and together we will come for you.Often small people aren't taken seriously. I should know that, because I'm not that tall of a person myself. So it took me great satisfaction to see that small, underrated Ant-Man brings us the solution to this whole mess. Remember: especially small people can have the biggest impact.It's quite poetic, ironically tragic, how Thanos finds his end. Well, both times are. Thor took his advise and aimed for the head. The rest is dust in the wind.People might say it's an overly long attempt of making money with a storyline that took ten years to set up, an overwhelming amount of characters and too many references to all the other MCU movies. Well, my response to those people is: I don't care. Because I look at what this movie does with those who watch it. And what I see amazes me. I'm a strong believer that the fictional world is in some regards real because the fans let it become a realistic thing.
There are people who join you because you're your annoying self, sit through this three hour long epos and laugh with you even though you had to explain to them what was going on during the movie.
There are men sitting behind you in the cinema who don't even try to hide their tears when their favorite superhero dies.
When the whole theater gasps, cries out and is nearly getting a heart attack every time someone throws a punch at one of our heroes, because they can't stand watching them get hurt, you know you're sitting in a brillant and mind blowing MARVEL movie.
Give me one other movie franchise that has accomplished that. I dare you.I think superhero movies have this prejudice that they are supposed to be simple. There is a good and a bad guy. They fight and in the end the good guy wins. It's not like that anymore. MARVEL changed that. The whole MCU connects so many dynamics, storylines and characters that you really are lost if you don't watch all movies. It's quite clever. You have to watch every MARVEL movie to get the full experience in the end. So yes, some people will watch this movie and be completely confused in some scenes, because we're taking a trip down memory lane through a lot of MARVEL movies. But that's not what this movie stands for. It's not for falling asleep halfway through the movie or leaving the cinema before the credits roll down.
This movie is a gift, a treasure and a reward for all the love and passion and tears, for all those who stuck with MARVEL for the last ten years.
The ones who watched every minute and sat through every end credit scene just to get a few more seconds out of the movie.
It's for those who where in awe when Captain America was turned into a super soldier; who had goose-pimples when the Avengers first assembled, who fell a little bit more in love with Loki than with Thor, who where torn during the Civil War and wanted to protect Spider Man in his fight against the Vulture.
It's for everybody who felt like their heart was just ripped out of their chest after Infinity War.
We get a thank you, a band aid and a promise for much more to come.The end is not pleasing, there are things that could've been better, people that could've survived and people that could've come back.
But I think it's the best possible and most perfect end that we could've gotten out of all options. And there were fourteen million six hundred five other options. If this is what it takes to win, I take it. Where Infinity War was a brutal crushing of all our hearts, Endgame was the difficult task to put all of us back together, to reunite what was torn apart, to mend what was broken. It was as challenging as the collection of all the infinity stones for the avengers.
But it worked.
It's not undone. All the chaos not just disappeared, Infinity War wasn't simply erased. There are still broken parts and pieces, the events are going to leave scars.
But our family is back together again.
To quote Iron Man: »Part of the journey is the end.«
But an end doesn't have to be sad. Look at the Avengers:
One gets his peace.
One gets his time back.
One accepts himself for what he is.
One gets the chance to recover from his loses.
One protects her family.
One gets his family back for good.
If you look at it like that, I think everybody got their happy end.
An end can also be the start of a new beginning.There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to to fight the battles we never could.
They could.
Earth mightiest heroes avenged us.
All is well.
The sun is shining again - on all of us.There is just one more thing to say:
Thank you, Avengers!",positive
"Simply Awesome movie, nice character execution... amazing CGI.",positive
"The first 2 hours weren't great. Overall enjoyed it, the ending was satisfying enough. Saw it by myself, the wife wants to go, but I'm not anxious to see it again in theaters. Infinity war was much better in my opinion.",positive
"So many marvel movies until this moment. To be honest, I was never a marvel fan and probably this was the reason why I wasn't impressed with the previous Avengers. I just didn't care about the characters simply because I didn't know who they were (most of them). I didn't see their movies and frankly hadn't heard of them.
However, this movie managed to touch me and I felt connection even to those characters.
I didn't expect very deep and twisted plot (even though movie delivered a good one), I didn't expect amazing visuals (the movie delivered good ones). I only wanted to build a connection with so many characters I didn't know. And the movie delivered this to me amazingly good. I was surprised I actually cared about them in the end.
The movie deserves an 8 If I have to be not biased but as a DC fan who always criticized Marvel Movies (probably because I hate it that DC doesn't perform that good) I believe a 9 is also well deserved.
Good Job, Marvel!",positive
"It's a great story, and well put together. Though, there was some dead time here and there. One in particular was the support group scene. Boring and inappropriate.But, please don't start ruining these stories for the sake of homosexual ""inclusion."" You will certainly begin to see a tremendous decline in viewers in your future films, especially if you plan to make major characters gay.By the way, if the world actually lost half of its population, as history has proven over and over again, immorality would more likely be corrected, not celebrated.IMDb: Do not stop this review from being published. Every time I post a comment about homosexuality being forced on the American population, my post is denied. Stop it.",positive
"It's like when you meet again after 12 years an old SUPER HOT girlfriend, and she is coming with her 2 children and the first one is 11 years old.
Pfff. I am a big fan of the previous film. This one is a generous 5/10.
Robert D. Jr. is great. And...maybe Thor.The end.",negative
I am reviewing this movie in 2021 and it is so entertaining and perfectly planned that it can be enjoyed many times than once with a perfect ending and so many amazing heroes...just wow!!,positive
"My review of Avengers Endgame:The best MCU movie. The theatre went totally nuts. It had spectacular action. It was surprisingly funny, and emotionally captivating. It manages a large roster of well developed characters very well executed, everyone gets a moment to shine. Delightful throwbacks to previous outings as well as smartly placed pop culture references. A truly satisfying finale for the 22movie and 10 year story arc which we have loved. Refreshed rating.",positive
"Last 40 minutes is enough for 10/10. The best marvel movie , i've ever seen after the infinity war.",positive
"I never thought that a comic book movie could make me cry, and Avengers: Endgame made me cry... several times. I was a little skeptical at first at the fact the movie was over three hours long, and that they couldn't tell what needed to be told without it feeing rushed, but I was so wrong. Avengers: Endgame is the perfect ending to a beloved story that has lasted over ten years, it makes all the right choices and ticks all the boxes. For the first time in a while a movie surprised me not only once but 10 times, for once twists actually feel like a twist, they're not predictable as most movies are now-a-days. The casts performances made these once cheesy and quirky comic book characters feel like more human, showing some of the finest and convincing acting ever put to screen. The movies serious moments are jaw-dropping, but that still doesn't mean that theres no humour, in fact Endgame nearly has as much comedy in it as guardians of the galaxy. I loved the second act simply because it was cool and interesting to see past MCU movies from a different perspective. then the climax happens, and theres more 'war' in the climax than there is in the whole of 'infinity war', The climax has some of the most stunning action sequences in movie history. Robert Downey Jr was the perfect choice to kill of, simply because the person who started it all, should be the one to end it, his final words ""I am Iron Man"" really got me crying, but it didn't make me cry as much as the very last scene, with captain America finally getting his dance with Peggy Carter, something that we've all been wanting for eight years since Captain America: the first Avenger. With that being said, Avengers: Endgame is an emotional and bitter sweet way to end the saga that has come close to all our hearts, it's a wild ride through everything we've been through over this long decade, with it's phenomenal performances, beautiful script, stunning effects, suspenseful action, brilliant script and top quality cinematography; Avengers: Endgame will go down in history as the final piece of the puzzle to the most beloved franchise of all time, its perfection amongst the millions of movies that have been made, it will be remembered until the end of days as a cinematic masterpiece.",positive
This movie is the culmination of 21 movies for over 10 years in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.,positive
"So many great references and call backs to previous MCU movies.AMAZING final third of the movieeven the predictable moments are greatperfect ending to the first MCU saga, as well as a great set up to whatever marvel does nexteverything about this movie is important so avoid and any all spoilers if possible!",positive
"Great movie but i must say infinity war was the best MCU film ever.
Although this movie had more goosebumps than infinity war.But infinity war kept our
eyes glued.Captain America steals the show,steals my girl,my car and everything..
But it was Thor and Hulk.The two most powerful Avengers yet they ruined them.
And start was booring with the quantum realm thing.But the Battle was one of the biggest battle i've seen in theatre and also the greatest.",positive
"One word to describe Endgame: PERFECTION!!!!
Im curios about Spiderman - Far from home!",positive
"They fit their SJW bs in it, covered all angles especially feminism. Gave a predictable storyline, with some necessary endings for good measure. Could've easily cut off over an hour of useless scenes.It really wasn't anything special, at all.",positive
"After all the hype and build up for this I was expecting a little more than a romantic end to the MCU's most beloved franchise. Plot holes, character development and all around story really made the experience less than memorable. In the people that loved it or disliked it that I've talked to I feel like a 50/50 split is what I'm hearing although after enjoying the previous marvel films. I do not know if the people who rated it so high just feel an obligation to themselves to say they loved it so in their heart they weren't let down or that they did truly enjoy this giant mess of a movie. Take the popularity out of the franchise I think if this was released at the beginning of the MCU the rest wouldn't have done as well. That's my 2 cents.",negative
This is only one movie my favorite movie alltime-Forever.,positive
"This movie is by no means perfect. It isn't delicately weaved like the 21 movies before it. It isn't a story driven spectacular like Infinity war. It's a celebration.Yes, this movie is flawed. Some decisions were made with characters (Thor) that didn't seem justified in what could be their last outing. The whole concept of time travel adds more questions than it answers.But I have never, nor will I ever again, experience something like this. There are moments in this film that probably won't ever be topped. Several of them. It evokes every possible emotion, to the point where I still don't know how to feel.The best way I can describe this film is by saying I cannot describe it. It's just something that will stay with you forever.",positive
"It is an amazing movie but I think there had to be a little more action because it felt like one big mission for 2hr 30mins but last 30mins was the action part,I feel like it should be 2hrs storyline and 1hr action since the movie should be based on action because it's a superhero movie.",positive
"I haven't watched all movies before it, I've watched Infinity War and learnt about most characters from my friend who is a die hard Marvel fan, so I have all the necessary information somehow covered to enjoy this movie, and boy did I enjoy every bit of it.
Where do I begin? The writing, the directing, the acting was on point, all the scenes were great, the collusion between Thanos and his bad guys and the beloved Avengers, it was all perfectly executed.
A huge cinematic success regardless of what you think of Marvel, I can say this movie qualifies to be nominated by the big awards.
Funny moments, sad moments, happy moments, action moments, an all in experience and made me want to start over with all of the 21 movies leading to this one, hats off, this movie is DEFINITELY worth seeing.
10/10",positive
One of my favorite marvel movies. All the superheroes in one movie has been the made this the most thrilling movie yet.,positive
The only thing bad about this movie is that it means it's the end of an era for some of our favorite heroes. This movie is an epic conclusion that is emotional and satisfies the MCU,positive
"What else can I say? This picture is great. If I could, I would give it an 8.5/10, since there are flaws; no film has none, yet is a fun ride with humor, action, chills, and tragedy. Truly, a cinematic experience to remember.Yet still, out of Infinty War, Endgame is less in one major way, which is the biggest flaw this film has: Thanos. While a terrifcily written and seemingly unstoppable villian in IW, Thanos in Endgame is...just less. He isn't as fleshed out, especially during the first act, as he was in IW, and he is almost disappointing. In fact, most of the first hour and maybe hour and a half are. While I enjoyed the first couple of hours, could've been better paced and a good ten minutes coulve been edited out. In other words, it was kinda slow.As the second act ends, however, it goes from a tender 4 or 5 to a 12. It becomes the climax of not just one film, but 22, 11 years in the making. Without spoling, the final battle is amazing, cahotic and surprisingly violent for a Marvel Film.All in all, this is a fantastic ending to a great and quite frankly revolutionary film series, and I guarantee you will at least shed one tear. It has its flaws, which are sadly charecter related, but they don't drag the film through the mud. At a three hour runtime with this many characters, it makes sense that the Russos couldn't do everything perfectly. All in all, this film gets a 85/100.TIP: Don't sit through the entirety of credits, for there is no after scene, no thank you to the fans and no tribute to Sir Stan Lee, sadly. So don't waste your time and sit for 10 minutes.",positive
"First thing I wanna say that this movie killed all our stereotypes about filming. 3-rd part of Avengers by 2018 was great and when we watched it then we thought better movie making is not possible. it was too broken stereotype.
So, about Endgame. Three hours of absolute shock, especially for fan-experts in Marvel cinema universe. What happens with Hulk, what decisions makes Tony Stark who had trouble with Steve, how all Avengers change throughout the events... Incredibly.
Dramaturgy is amazing. The movie's plot is very complicated so you should watch it really carefully to understand all the details and be able to see all the plot's layers.
Let's sum up.
Believe me, you won't get problem to watch it carefully as I said above) You will be bulged-in the cinema seat from the first mins of watching!",positive
"I'm not usually one for getting teary-eyed over fictional characters. The only times I have were for Dobby, Logan, and Liliana in the War of the Spark trailer. So I expected to get a slight gut punch from the movie, given the stakes. But what I got was a whirlwind of humor, nostalgia, and pure sadness. Whatever the naysayers may tell you, this movie is wholly worth the ticket price.",positive
"I think giving this film a 2 was being kind. Iv rarely been so excited to watch a film and to say I feel let down is an understatement. It's hard to know where to start as theres so many flaws in this film. The film feels rushed which is unbelievable for a film that's 3hours long but you could of fit the first hour and half in 10minutes. I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing, the film was that boring. The whole time travel is just a complete mess and how easy were the avengers able to get all the stones, that was a joke. In regards to the battle at the end it was ok but it's almost like the writers wanted it to be this big iconic battle that people would be talking about for years but that fell flat too. This films been 10 years in the waiting and 21 films later and to end like that was just poor...So poor.",negative
Each nd every character has been handled so efficiently perfectly balanced!!! Despite being 3 hours long it keeps us on edge of our seats,positive
One of the best movie I ever watched.A must watch for all the Marvel fans. Full of action & emotions.,positive
Awesome movie epic movie this is a perfect end of infinity saga.......,positive
"No spoiler brief review for fans and non fans:-If you are a Marvel fan, then you know you shouldn't miss this movie so please watch it before anyone spoils it for you. Even if someone does spoil it, the movie is worth watching for its spectacular special effects, music by Alan Silvestri and stellar performances by the cast. The 3D version of the movie is nice as the 3D effect adds additional depth to the fight scenes and space scenes. It's a movie that has so many scenes which feel like they are there to please the fans and the scenes have a lot of emotional impact because of the character development as well as back-story that have built up the emotions throughout the years. This movie is something that should be kept in your DVD or Blu-Ray collections when officially released later on, as there are so many things in this movie which will make you want to revisit it and relive the moments. You will not get bored by this movie and might as well watch it twice or even more times in the theater.If you are not a Marvel fan or haven't watched any of the Marvel movies, the movie does tell you what happened in the Avengers Infinity War and even if you won't be able to identify with some of the characters, you can guess that Avengers are the good people and they are trying to stop the bad guy, Thanos from conquering the world and also to try and repair what he did in the Infinity War movie. The movie is worth watching for its special effects, acting, music and great production value. Some character decisions might divide the audience, so how you feel will depend on your personal attachment and expectations form a particular super hero character's story arc.This is the last Russo Bros. Marvel film according to a GamesRadar Interview and the last Stan Lee cameo (RIP). Go watch it!",positive
"Amazing,simply awesome and a wow movie! A perfect treat for marvel fans and as the title suggest.... what an endgame! A very perfect combination of all mcu superheroes and hard-working of thousands of people.
It emphasises emotion as much as action and a lovely comic timing which makes audience not to miss a second of scene!
The best ever movie of mcu!with the perfect #Endgame",positive
"The film begins straight 3 weeks after the events of Infinity War with Captain Marvel rescuing Iron Man and Nebula and bringing them to Earth. IM doesn't want anything to do with the Avengers anymore so doesn't go with the rest of the team to hunt down Thanos who's now living on some distant planet. The Avengers along with CM get to the planet to find out that the Gauntlet with the stones has been destroyed along with the stones so that no one can undo what Thanos has done. At this moment Thor chops off Thanos' head and you then realise that the rest of the film isn't going to be about how to get back at Thanos. Remember this is in the very first 20 minutes.Fast forward 5 years and the Avengers have all moved on to other priorities in their lives and only BW and CA are running the Avengers. As luck would have it, a rat walks over the controls of the quantum machine thing and out pops Ant Man from the end of the last Ant Man film. He then teams up with BW and CA to reassemble the Avengers and go back in time to get the stones and undo what Thanos has snapped. The rest of the film is how the stones are recovered and how everything is resolved. This is my main gripe with this film, time travel...I always feel that films that feature time travel or alternate universes use this as an easy way to get around problems and issues with the story. They ended the previous film with killing off half the characters and then thought how can we bring them back? I know we'll just go back in time and sort everything out. Don't get me wrong, I love time travel films, one of my all-time favourites is back to the future, as long as time travel is what the theme of the story is, but to use time travel as an easy excuse to give the Heroes an advantage is the lazy option. Recently the re-booted Star Trek being an example of an alternate universe which just didn't have the same emotional connect as the original series as very easily everything that has been shown can just be erased/altered with time travel and introducing an alternate universe. If you want to watch a good series that uses alternate universes then I would highly recommend searching out Fringe which was shown around 10 years ago.So now we've established time travel is what the major portion of this film is going to be could we please stop referencing older time travel films just so the makers can poke fun at their own stupid idea before the audience does. The amount of times Back to the future is called upon is sometimes a bit shameful. This film gives you so much de ja vu that you know that you've seen this before, BKF2 anyone. There's even a scene reminding you of Doc's explanation to Marty about scewing the timeline. It's a shame Marvel couldn't think of any other way to get back at Thanos other than resorting to time travel. Also, why not just time travel back with CM to when Thanos was about to snap and add her into the fight as well? Would be a lot easier than trying to get the stones back one by one! Also, this time machine they devise not only lets you travel through time but also lets you change your geographical location, amazing! But I will say this, on the flip side using time travel to revisit the past films is the best way to tie everything in and a chance for some serious fan service!So once the stones are recovered Iron Man does the snap again and the entire Avengers characters return for one last bad ass battle with Thanos. Here there are some great action set pieces and the majority of the characters get their own small part to play, especially during the whole 'rugby' sequence with the new gauntlet. But the flaw here is that Iron Man uses the gauntlet to do the snap and not Thor or Hulk who are more powerful. But obviously Marvel wanted to end this infinity stone saga with the death of Iron Man as it started with Iron Man back in 2008. So a well justified send off for the character and also now not having to pay Robert Downey Jr so much either. I'd like to say the following, a more emotional ending during Iron Man's death scene would have been having Thor, CA, Hulk, and Hawkeye kneeling around Iron Man and at this point CA and IM shake hands to put aside their differences and then Gwyneth's character saying her line. Currently you see CA and Thor crying at IM's death but you don't really get a sense of where they're stood. Where's BW you ask? She died trying to get the soul stone and doesn't even get a funeral scene!So to summarise, even though there are so many flaws with the story and screenplay, being over 3 hours long, because you're 11 years and 22 films deep into this saga you easily brush over the minus points and only leave the cinema with plus points. The film is a cinematic gem and the final hour or so more than makes up for the short comings mentioned earlier.As an afterthought, the ending of the film shows CA not coming back to his reality after returning the stones to the respective points in time and instead living his life through to an old man with Agent Carter. Could this mean then that what we are now seeing is not the same universe but an alternate universe where things are now changed? How else would an easier solution be to include the X-Men into the MCU now that Disney has bought 20th Century Fox?",positive
"I like lot of things from the movie. But some unexplained things and flaws made it less compared to infinity war.
1. Thor was a disappointment
2. is it really necessary for tony to snap? (couldn't he just use the power of infinity stones to fight Thanos)
3. Time travel thing is really confusing
I wish tony had a better fight with Thanos (Captain stole the show in the climax)",positive
"If you thought Avengers: Infinity War (2018) was as best as it could get then you're sadly mistaken. Endgame doesn't disappoint, with amazing references, those one liners and a pinch of comedy; this film is definitely setting high standards. The perfect balance between drama and action. A must watch!",positive
"I totally loved the movie, I was entertained by 3 hours.I think that there are a lot of fan services in the movie, i loved the way they present us this new smart hulk, he was awesome! But in other hand, the fat Thor was funny at the beginning but later he was kind of annoying.There are so much inconsistencies and questions that I have.How it is that in infinity war, Thor was able to hit thanos so easily (A thanos with 6 stones of 2018) and here with Captain America (That now he spreads thunder too? ) and with Ironman they don't even have a chance against a thanos of 2014 without ANY infinity stones. That's bad, that doesn't make any sense, either this was false or Infinity war was false.Other thing is that in infinity war, Cap can grab thanos hand and stop him from snapping his fingers, here in Endgame the most powerful hero in the MCU Captain Marvel, she also stopped thanos hand the same way as Cap.In infinity war, Tony, Quill, Peter, etc they almost had the gauntlet with a sleepy thanos, in this case they don't removed the stones. Here in infinity war, it was a piece of cake for Tony to remove ALL THE STONES FROM HIS GAUNTLET, why he didn't do that before with a sleepy thanos ??? WTF??And finally, if you travel back in time you are messing with another time line right? ANOTHER. Then, how cap traveled to another time line, and appears in the present one without suit or anything? It was only for the beautiful ending? (I loved it, but ... explain it more at least)",positive
"Everyone is going to hate me for this review. Partial spoiler.This movie was totally predictable, full of flaws with a repeat of if the Infinity War battle , where IMHO they could have just used the same footage.Does Hollywood have no remaining creative ability?2 hours of slow moving, boring video to get to a totally expected ending.While not a total waste of time I am thankful I got a discount and only paid $4.00 for this film.My wife on the other hand fell asleep",negative

"Great movie with great performance,story and amazing screenplay.
And lengendry climax scene""AVENGERS ASSEMBLE""",positive
"I had very high expectations for this movie and absolutely no ideas on how they were gonna fix the situation created in 'Infinity War' but, again, MARVEL exceeded any expectation no matter how high or impossible they were and has done it perfectly. They managed to create a story for this movie, but at the same time also paying an omage to the original three trilogies giving, by this, a sense of closure for these characters. Every character had its own moment and place to shine throughout the movie. This is how the story ends and it's perfect, because this is how it's supposed to end: every character chose it's own destiny for once and it's incredibly sad and heartbreaking, but in the end it's the right thing. In conclusion, this is the greatest movie I've ever seen, thank you MARVEL.",positive
"In the end, when Cap is saying his last goodbye to Sam, after his has lived a life with Peggy, WHY DOESN'T HE HAS A MOMENT WITH BUCKY TOO?! He's his best friend, his only family from 1940s and they go way back...I'm pissed",positive
"What can I say! It was everything we all hoped for and more! Absolutely incredible, I couldn't believe my eyes. A little confused trying to get my head around certain things with the hole time travel thing. Very emotional! Just be ready! The best avengers yet! So exciting!!!",positive
Whoever hasn't seen this movie yet in theaters!!! Please go and check it out!! It is definitely worth the money!!! The Russo brothers have done an outstanding job directing this whole entire film!! I am extremely proud of their hard work!!!,positive
"This movie has a lot of great things going for it. It has its typical mcu comedic charm despite the atmosphere of defeat. It definitely has things that will make you tear up a bit, especially compared to previous movies. The action, while in my opinion was scarce compared to previous movies, was still fun to watch.My biggest cons to the movie are the following:
1. Fat thor
2. Limited action scenes
3. Most of all, time travelFat thor was funny at first but I was really hoping he would whip into shape. Instead I just couldn't take him serious which is a shame because he's such a cool character.The action scenes just seemed to be resolved so quick. I was hoping this war would be an epic battle of like lord of the rings: the return of the king proportion. Instead we get a big build up, with quick resolution. I find it incredibly convenient that the whole squad works to get the new infinity gauntlet to the portal and even with captain marvels ability to fly it still lands next to thanos. I mean come on..Then there's the time travel. I wish I could list every single plot hole that comes along with time travel in this movie. A lot just doesn't make sense. Like why wouldn't simply bringing one stone to the future prevent anyone from disappearing in the first place? Thanos would never had completed the gauntlet. There's a multitude of other examples that just ruin it for me the more I think about other plot holes. It's a shame I think they built it up so well in infitity war. Time travel is such a cop out to resolve things, I hate that they had to use it here.But all in all this movie is definitely worth the theater visit. I enjoyed watching it, but when I read that it is getting tens? I think people are just giving it that out of the hype of the movie instead really critically thinking about its flaws.",positive
This movie is just epic. Plain epic. The story is well told and the emotion is felt when some of the characters must sacrifice themselves. What an amazing movie period.,positive
Prefer movies like interstellar than this. Done with Avengers.,positive
"I gave this title a 4. I have long been a fan of Marvel films and this especially after infinity war left me with disappointment.Firstly the film is needlessly long, there are blocks of time that could be cut out and it would only have served to make the film better.Secondly is about the Hulk. Never have I been so disappointed with directors and a main character. We all know the story from Infinity war, Thanos batters hulk, and hulk goes into hiding. We also all know that the hulk has immeasurable power and strength. Que what we all wanted to see. HULK RAGE, not so half attempt at hipster hulk who is all in touch with his emotions. We wanted to see Hulk go HULK on Thanos, the most likely thing her was going to do was discuss beard growing tactics - pathetic.Needless to say there are A LOT of plot holes in this film, with unfortunately no end is sight for terrible characters such as HawkEye or Buckey (whose only power is being able to use a gun!?).That said the end battle sequence was good (thus the 4 rating).The light at the end of the tunnel is that there is remake after remake, so maybe on the remake we will all get what we are looking for... HULK SMASSSSSHHHH",negative
"Being a Marvel Fan, I am happy with the movie. The movie had some great moments a Fan could wish for. But the expectation from the movie especially after the performance of Infinity War (a mind blowing movie: 10/10) were not fulfilled. The movie literally had so many loop holes and lacked logic at many critical points that I couldn't really enjoy the positives as much as I did for Infinity War.I watched the Movie in IMAX 3D, so obviously the viewing experience was awesome as the movie was shot very well, the cinematography, the VFX, the action scenes, etc. were really great (10/10). But then came in time travel and they took a stand on the concept of time travel different from any other movie. Even that is fin as they have the freedom. But then repeatedly, at every crucial point they violated the rules that they set themselves. The concept of creating a parallel timeline, the concept of not effecting your present by travelling to the past was all lost when they started collecting the stones.
The same issue is with Captain Marvel altering the time line at the end of the movie.Another problem is the idea of how Thanos with such a huge army travelled through time to the present using just 1 vial of Pym particle and with no available technology of using the Pym Particle is beyond digestion. They need to explain that part as everything relies on that.There are many other loop holes and errors (I have counted more that 10 major-major issues). But the movie had many positive points. Professor Hulk finally appeared as expected. A base for Ronan has been set. Almost everyone is back for the Last Battle. And sadly, Iron man is dead (that another problem with the logic of the movie).No doubt that many movie have loop holes, but it wasn't expected at such a large scale of this Movie. It was a 10/10 because of the battles, because of the acting, etc. But it lost 2 crucial points because of the flawed storyline. The movie is an emotional sine curve, it has moment of anxiety, joy, horror, sadness, excitement, etc. But surely it's not a 'Movie of the Generation' or a 'Masterpiece'. I feel Infinity war deserves and keeps these titles.But worth a watch, and do watch it in IMAX, you would love the battles.",positive
"To sit there in the cinema and laugh your heart out one second, then the other scream of excitement and the third cry of sadness is not easy for one movie to pull off!
THIS is the best Marvel movie so far and the best end that it could ever be!
Marvel fan or not. You want to see this one. If it's just for the special effects, the costumes or just the raw jokes you are going to enjoy it!",positive
"Overall i loved the movie!
The use of time travel didnt make sense at all with alot of unanswered questions.
Really disappointed with the use of thor...
Cap marvel should've been used aloft more!!
IW was a lot better, but still loved it.",positive
"Avengers Endgame was a good movie. I don't know what it could've done differently. It had action, comedy, drama, and big surprises. Everyone had a chance to get their story told on screen and be the main focus. I did feel though that sometimes the movie did drag on a little, but it was necessary to get the characters emotions across.
For some reason I could not stand any scene with Captain Marvel. She just had this intense arrogance about her that rubbed me the wrong way, considering every other character was already fully developed by the time she arrives onto the scene. The story was great, it had the perfect blend of comedy, and drama that just kept things flowing. Although whenever it came to the drama, I did get a little bored. I love drama, but these moments just felt like they were taking forever.
Also, I feel the battle scenes could've been more intense. They were too far and few in between. I enjoyed the ending, it brought closure whether you liked it or not. I feel with movies like these, movies that bring an end to something that has been built up over soo many years, is always going to give you a sense of dissatisfaction. I don't know if it's because of the sadness that it's all over, or maybe the story didn't play out how you wanted too. I don't know where that feeling comes from, but this gave that to me.
I don't really have to say whether you should watch it or skip it because unless you're living under a rock, you've either watched it or are going to watch it.
I gave this movie an 8/10. It was a good movie, but I felt Infinity Wars was better in terms of delivery, battle scenes and excitement. Check it out for yourself.",positive
"The most awaited movie from MCU would definitely blow your mind. The story starts off a bit slow just to give you the character referencing and build plot to the grand finale of this epic battle. It has too many jaw dropping moments, some cleverly written jokes and a superb climax.
I would strictly recommend not to miss this movie.",positive
Mind blowing movie I mean it was so good that we gave it a standing ovation. One of my favorite and Marvel has done a great job. Most people think Marvel is childish but it is actually a nice movie for all generations. You won't regret to watch it and it will 100% make a smile on your face.,positive
Just it it was great movie but there were weakness in the story no character development,positive
"Look, all I want to write is that this is an amazing movie. Slowly builds up, but when it takes off, it takes off. The entire theater was in laughter during many scenes and the entire theater was in tears a couple times due to sadness!! Not too fond of the ending, but that's how most movies go. Go see it (not in 3D because nothing jumped out. The very beginning with Stark in space is cool in 3D, but nothing else).",positive
"Really good overall for a superhero movie, I just wish they learn how to use their power and even the infinity stones, to bring healing to the world and make it a better place to live, not just defeat evil. But to actively DO GOOD.The problem that Thanos was trying to solve is a lack of resources for the inhabitants of the universe. His solution is just very messed up and stupid, to kill half the population.Instead, let him have a spiritual awakening, and the Avengers to use the stones to actually solve this to create more resources and/or increase the Abundance circulating in the universe while inspiring altruism and compassion.We need heroes to become ambassadors of Peace and altruism, not just defenders against threats (using violence). Praying for the upgrade in our collective consciousness",positive
It was so forgettable I forgot to write my review when I saw it in the theater....three hours and no fight scenes with the hulk....need I say more?,negative
"Good movie but not a fan of the time travaling, also i cry watching this movie.
Also i hate Brie Larson in this movie",positive
"As a marvel fan, many of us will be so excited about to know how Thanos could be defeated by our heroes. The story line of the movie is about time-travelling in order to collect infinity stones before Thanos getting it but despite cliche story it contains the elements of sentiments and yes more hilarious moments in the movie even audience won't know that coming.The ending of the movie will be quite emotional for the Marvel fans that could break into tears. In my opinion, it was a good goodbye for MCU superheroes. Endgame is a movie that gives a lot of life lessons not just giving you a stunning visual effects and state of the art superheroes features. It's a visual treat for Marvel Fans.",positive
This is a good film but not a masterpiece as some are saying. Is waaay too long at 3 hours. There are some nice moments throughout the film and some good acting but I wasn't blown away with it all. Not sure it is going to be a consistent repeat viewing blu ray when it comes out but maybe at 48 I am getting too old for all this comic book stuff.,positive

"Avengers: Endgame, is the biggest movie from Marvel studios, and had the mission of end the Iron Man era, one of the most important characters from Marvel, and it almost got it, but Infinity War is so much audacious, something that doesn't exist here, the most audacious thing here, is the iron man's death, but somehow it would happen, the Infinity War's end was so much exciting. But is a worthy end of this Marvel's era",positive
"Disney does nothing but ruin franchises they ruined Star Wars and guardians of the galaxy and now they ruined the Avengers. Infinity wars was bad, but end game is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Make Thor a drunk the hulk is not only weak but a wimp. And Captain Marvel is just the end all be all. I'm done with Disney permanently I would give end game zero stars if I could.",negative
"From the iron smacking sound in the cave, to the ultimate war on the planet to save ""half"" of humanity.Great CGI.Great Character we can remember, Ironman, Cap, hail hydra, Thor the useless, Hulk the no longer invincible, As an ending movie, it does successfully put an ending to each character.Time travel, you can change the past, but only to satisfy the plot, and great escape for cap to enjoy seventy years of hiding.Thanos, do I know you? To kill once is not enough, twice or thrice if count ""what if"".Without tv series like ""Loki"" ""What if"", Avengers end game is definitely the best end movie for MCI.",positive
This film...I am speechless. All I can say is you don't have to be a Marvel fan to think this movie is insane. Nothing can beat this,positive
"Great movie that has everything fans want. Great characters, good writing, and amazing wrap up of an epic story. This is no way worthy of a 1 and I'm suspicious of anyone who would rate it that way. A lot went into this movie and the actors, writers, directors, etc deserve much better. It deserved all the success and hype it got!",positive
"After eleven years and twenty-one movies, the Endgame is finally here and I must say it's everything it should be. With a massive runtime of three hours, ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) rarely feels like it wastes a second. In regards to its runtime, each hour of the movie does have its own sort of beginning, middle, and end along with its own themes. The first hour of the movie really hits hard as a sort of drama hot off the events of ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) and I could see how it might be a tad boring if you didn't watch all the previous movies leading up to this one, but for those of you that did it's amazing to watch our heroes fighting a battle that they can't suit up for. Things truly get interesting however in the second hour of the movie, which plays off as more of a thriller reminiscent of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014). There are some great action sequences here, but most of the excitement comes from the high stakes, suspense, and a happy serving of fan service. Last but not least, the final act of the movie. The last hour of ""Endgame"" is everything you could ever want for the epic conclusion of this franchise. Superb action scenes, inspiring moments, and some of the best character exchanges you could ever hope to see.
From beginning to end, you can tell the people at Marvel Studios really gave it their all on this one. Robert Downey Jr continues and surpasses expectations with Iron Man, whose arc in this movie hits home on so many levels. Chris Evans, on the other hand, takes the spotlight in this movie with his Captain America, once again we get to see his symbol of all that is good try to find hope in the aftermath of a devastating loss. It should also be noted that while Iron Man and Captain America both have incredible arcs throughout the movie, it is possible Thor that has the best arc of the entire MCU both in and out of universe. Watching as his character learns what it means to be worthy in the first Thor, only to be faced with loss and failure in every movie he's appeared in after might seem harsh but Chris Hemsworth does a terrific job balancing the humor that Taika Waititi added to the character along with the pain that he has experienced. Of course, all of this was possible thanks to the excellent directing of Anthony and Joseph Russo and the oversight of Marvel's very own Kevin Feige who is a Stan Lee for the modern era.
As you might be able to tell I found the movie does have a ton of pro's, but that's because it was everything that I could ever hope for after following this franchise since I was nine years old going to see the first ""Iron Man"" (2008) with my dad and brothers. With that said though, like all movies this one does have flaws and most of them just come from the fact that this movie serves more of a love letter to fans than a film shooting for an oscar nomination. While the heroes truly do thrive in this one, Thanos does take a slight step back and in my opinion, caused him to be a slightly less compelling villain when compared to his portrayal in the previous movie. He does, however, get his fair share of amazing scenes, I just didn't find I was as connected to the big bad as I once was. The film's biggest flaw might be the amount of fan service in it. While it's great watching it, and caused me and the rest of my theater to cheer and clap till our hands bruised during the premier, sometimes it felt a little redundant or hung around too long. One such scene happens in the third act of the movie without going into too many details to avoid spoilers, during the final battle there's a massive tease towards the future of the MCU as a certain group of heroes band together. It's an awesome scene and I really look forward to seeing how it pays off, but thanks to the dialogue it comes off as forced and cheesy. It's meant to invoke similar emotions to ""Avengers"" (2012) when we see the heroes band together for the first time in New York, but fails to recognize that that scene was great due to the age-old rule of ""show, don't tell.""
All that said, be sure to check the movie out as soon as possible. It's definitely meant to be seen on a large screen with loud surround sound speakers, but be aware you might not enjoy it as much if you haven't seen all the other movies. Overall I would give it an 8.5/10 and a ranking of Marvelous.",positive
"I very much enjoyed the movie, however (without giving spoilers) I'm left scratching my head about where things like Agents of SHIELD, and Spider-man - Far From Home fit within the timeline.Apart from that, I'm happy with how the story unfolded (even with plot holes) It didn't seem like a long movie to me.
I know many people aren't happy with the direction that Thor has taken, but I enjoyed the comedy of Thor and Banner.
Surprisingly there was nothing that really hit me in the feels, the way that most Marvel movies have managed to do at least once. But I did find love for certain characters solidified in this movie.Overall, it's kinda predictable (as most are in the genre) with a few surprising moments in it, and some good laughs. A very satisfying end to The Infinity Saga.",positive
"It was phenomenal...! It was a movie of 3hours and 2 min long but not even a microsecond of movie was boring... (If you're going to watch it then make sure you carry a lots of tissue paper with you...)
Simply i loved it",positive
Entertaining action and certainly comical interaction between characters but a disappointingly predictable culmination of many years and many movies.,positive
"Don't spoil the endgame
Just never
Best superhero movie ever made",positive
"I strongly agree this movie has everything all marvel fans hoped for, with amazing special effects, epic fight scenes and much more, but one thing that made quite disappointed was the solution to the problem previously presented in infinity war.
They decided to solve this entire situation using time traveling, which is completely fine if you do it the right way. The producers and directors made a bold move to present a whole new concept of how time traveling works, differing from classics of this genre, like the ""back to the future"" and ""terminator"" franchises.
In my opinion this whole decision becomes an issue when they're explaining their plan is going to work, since they take a really limited time of the movie doing that. I think they should've invested more time in that aspect, considering they had a three hour film and barely used fifteen minutes of that actively exposing their plan, basically saying that they were using time traveling as a solution and it wasn't the same thing as in ""back to the future"", not making the audiences understand them just so they can make a silly joke.
I later understood what they meant, but that required further research on the subject after the movie, and the audiences should leave the theaters understanding the whole movie plot, something that didn't happen to me and others.",positive
They shy away from the true aftermath expected from half the universe dying. Only Thor's regret was believable. The entire time heist plot was bull and boring to watch. The battle was hugely overcrowded nothing caught my eye like wow look at that. They should not have had the whole Dr Strange bull that there was only one way. There were many ways it could have been avoided. Felt nothing.,negative
"I Had high expectations after seeing avengers infinity war and i must say that i'm not
disappointed at all. They kicked it up a notch, not with more action but with a heartfelt story. Hats of to Kevin feige and the russo brothers.",positive
"This is the movie for which the whole world waited. We won't get an another movie like this for sure.
Love, Emotions, Friendship , Goosebumps and fight scenes are perfectly scripted.
One main theme is 'Sacrifice' yes it's needed in our real life too but we can't or won't bear it.
This movie will be remembered forever especially as a fan with all our super heroes in it mainly Iron Man (Tony Stark).
Love all the characters and the person who gave life to the characters..Stan Lee",positive
"When I was 18 years old I watched the first Ironman movie, the movie ended with the famous line ""I am Ironman!"", 10 years later the same dialogue but with a different emotion! The character development of the spoilt young billionaire scientist to the Selfless Saviour of the universe. Marvel set the benchmark so high that any comic book movie or any film franchise series have to try really hard to achieve what the MCU had managed to do in the last 10 years with 22 different movies!The way they managed to show every single important character casted in the previous Marvel movies without any unwanted fillers is really mind blowing, each scene has it's own purpose and convincingly good. I was expecting to see a back to the future cliche but what we witnessed is Epic beyond comparison. The movie made everyone to laugh, smile, awe, think, brought to the edge of the seat and definitely made everyone to weep! All the fan theories, fan dreams and wishes came true! This is not the ending we asked for but this is the endgame we deserve! Proud to be a part of the Great Marvel fandom!",positive
"I have never reviewed anything in my life but i needed to, just for this movie.PLEASE see this movie. it is the most intense marvel movie to exist, and i cannot express enough how incredible it is. it's funny, and heartbreaking and so intense.i am so happy that this phase ended in this way, with a movie that is so almost perfect. the acting was incredible and moving the entire way through (where is RDJ's oscar at?) so.. i guess what i want to say is ; please go see this movie.
ok thank you i love steve rogers :)",positive
"I have 47 years old and very pop culture taste for movies.I read Marvel comics from my first memory, my big hero is tony stark.And this movie is a piece of art of our times.
Si complex to solve and present this stories, so human is simply perfect.I love it
And I shared with my family and kid.
Is important share something with the youngest.Please just enjoy
An event like this will be not repeated in at least in 10 years",positive
"After reflection, the movie ended to allow the franchise to move forward with the newer characters and give a wrap-up to the original cast. While there are some plot holes, it is fairly consistent with the entire story arc. The one aspect that was noticeable and very disappointing was the political agenda that was there throughout. The story was not impacted by these items, therefore they could have (and should have) been removed. Their inclusion in the final version is telling. It is tiresome that hollywood's Elites keep pushing their agenda, as it will continue to push fans away. They knew people very vested in this movie, so they could get away with it. Enjoy the movie and ignore their politics.",positive
"It was a very enjoyable movie and a nice way to conclude 11 years of MCU movies, with really good, emotional send offs for Iron Man and Captain America.However I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have hoped for a couple of reasons:DESTROYING THOR AND HULKS CHARACTERSThis was a massive disappointment. Thor is my favourite character and from going from Ragnarok/Infinity War Thor to fat, drunk, underpowered Thor was ridiculous. He's funny and it's understandable at the beginning as Hemsworth does such a good job, but you're waiting for the moment for it to click for him and for him to go back to being the Thor he previously was, but this never really happens. After improving him with each marvel movie, he goes back 10 steps in this.
After what happened to Hulk in Infinity War you think he'll go on a journey within himself and finally unleash the raging hulk everyone wants to see and have round 2 with Thanos. He never does and Hulk is pathetic the whole movie. We wanted the 2008 or Avengers Assemble Hulk.I can see why they would do this with both characters, especially Thor as he almost killed Thanos with a complete gauntlet, so a full power Thor vs Thanos with no stones wouldn't be much of a fight, especially with the help of Cap and Iron Man. Maybe Marvel are setting them up for future movies and putting them in a position to continue their stories, but if that is the case, Endgame was the completely wrong movie to do this.The pacing was very weird with a slow opening 45 minutes with a lot of emotion and character development. This is fine but then the pace went from 0 to 100 when they all went to get the different infinity stones and it all got a little confusing. Then it went up a notch again with the final battle which became a bit much when all of the old characters joined the battle and there were tons of main characters all now involved in the fight. It was enjoyable but the pacing made it feel like not a very well made movie.",positive
"Really good movie, my kind of movie overall. I love Thors hippie style <3",positive
Endgame had some quality acting by the main cast and some mediocre at best from the supporting cast. There were bits in the movie were it was slow and unentertaining. The story during the middle section felt like it was dragging along. Other then that the movie was good,positive
Just saw Avengers Endgame and I feel disappointed. I loved Infinity War and seeing this makes me want to just end the story with Thanos winning in the last film. The humor was entertaining but severely misplaced. Many characters did not feel like themselves and even with all the references to past marvel films I feel cheated. I don't want to spoil anything for you guys so i'm just gonna leave it there.,negative
I am so emotional watching the last movie of ironman. This movie is awesome. I am happy to being part of the marvel universe.,positive
"A wonderful experience. A journey worth remember and watched.
And also part of a journey is end but an epic end.",positive
"If you thought Avengers Infinity War was the best Marvel had to offer, think again. Marvel ups their game by several notches in this movie. It's the perfect movie for the ending of a saga of Marvel movies. It's three hours of pure joy excitement and enthusiasm",positive
Just came out of the cinema. It was pretty good. Nice way now to end the avengers. Enjoy.,positive
Reasonably slow build up was required to properly explain the whole time travel build up and in the end was absolutely worth the wait as the fight scenes were absolutely immense and brings the 11 year journey of the Avengers to a scintillating and awfully emotional end.,positive
"Awsome. Im stunned.
How in gods name can someone give this movie a rating of 1?",positive
"Loved infinity war and hoped end game would be close but ended up very disappointed. The movie started off strong then felt slow for the next 2 hours. While the movie did end on a good note, the plot overall felt very lazy and was filled with plot holes. The few great moments make the movie worth it but definitely not in the elite superhero movies for me",positive
This is hands down the best movie ever made. Same formula as Infinity War with emotions because they are everywhere. I felt it more for reasons I cannot spoil for anyone but I highly recommend this movie for everyone. Go watch it.,positive
"So I just watch endgame last night the movie it self was actually pretty good. But the things we hoped to see happen that should have happen and things that definitely happened at some points shouldn't. For myself everything I wanted see happen, I guess you could say did but not in the ways myself and probably most fans wanted to see. hoping to see all the redemptions for certain characters from Infinity war didn't really happen in the most satisfying way, I'm trying very hard not to spoil anything for anybody so I'm trying to be very vague with what I'm trying to say some characteristics gets redemptions from the first movie but I feel like it was here do this quickly so we can move on to another scene definitely could have wrapped up in Less than 3 hours.I will say this though in the last half of the movie was probably the most satisfying visually but once it got to the end. I feel like it was hurry this up and get it over with my opinion. So don't base your feelings upon Avengers endgame on what I'm saying here everyone looks at it differently. So this is just my Outlook on it, everyone is going to have a different one.thanks",positive
"Has a lot of plotholes, but I still enjoyed it. However, the rating should be lowered to atleast 7 so im giving it 1 to balance it out, as all things should be.",negative
"All the emotional sustenance a movie should provide are here with action, drama, suspense, comedy and the culmination of a decade of movies. The movies serve as piecemeal backdrops which certainly service the title's narrative in ways that does not require exposition.
The pacing is logical and although it subverts some expectations it builds a crescendo that only lets up when you've passed all possible heights for how a conflict of this scale can unfold.
The crux of the matters around which the character's motivations were constructed is resolved by sheer brilliance - not because of complexity but rather simplicity: a clean, honest rendering of the character's inner drives being used to full effect.
The narrative is convoluted in appearance only. While initially the characters attempt to make sense of things, even the most astute quickly come to terms with how limited their understanding is. The drive to do what must be done overtakes everyone in a fever the Mad Titan was all too familiar with in Infinity War.
Those seeking to unfurl the logic of events are misguided by considering causality as a factor. The story's events are as unforgivably non-linear as the quantum realm through which the Ant Man ventured through on previous occasions.
Those seeking to damn the studio for portraying their favourite character as less than desirable forget that *character development* does not always equal ""betterment"" but it does gain sympathy as our equal. In their lowest point, giving what little you can is still sacrifice and bravery.
Those who dislike the matters of representation need not be overly sensitive as it does not yield ground to character substance and worth.
Those who seek a puzzle waiting to be resolved are inevitably disappointed.
Those who appreciate rhythm and are invested in the story so far will be rewardedIf reading all the above was tiresome, you've earned your rest.",positive
"I have been looking forward to 'Avengers - End Game' since I saw the first film. The sequel was everything I expected. Action-packed but lots of slow parts, which makes the movie drag at times. But thete were many fast-paced action scenes & I loved the Doctor Who reference. I laughed, I cried, I was on the edge of my seat. Good performances, but almost too many characters for me to keep track of for me. If you love superhero movies, this one is a treat!",positive
The movie that you just want to watch again and again and again until eternity,positive
"This Movie was so awesome! I love how its live action and its really really good like infinity war.
You should go see this",positive
"If you watched all the previous films of the MCU, this film has lots of payoffs. I throughly enjoyed it. Great popcorn flick.",positive
"Once it's over, it's over. Lots of credits. Very slow moving. Don't bother sitting through them.Movie made us both laugh and cry and was perfectly written, acted, and directed. Loved it!",positive
"I expected a lot from this final chapter. Unfortunately I think Infinity War was better. Endgame is good but unbalanced and a lot to digest in 3 hours. Many twists, plots and a lot of characters, especially at the end. For sure it is emotional, funny and good effects, but some parts should have either been exploited more or left out. The thing that bothered me the most was that some characters' powers were not balanced compared to the other movies. But for the rest of them, you will love their development until this moment.
Overall it's a must-see movie, but to make sense for everybody go and see the rest of MCU first, starting with Iron Man.",positive
Of course we can't make a full comic universe in one movie but pretty impress did like it almost cried 3 times ! Lots of Comedy thanks to Thor. Some sad part .. a lot of applause cheering!!,positive
"I really enjoyed Endgame, but not as much as Infinity War. Infinity War to me, was an almost perfect movie. Its a bit difficult to explain this mixed feeling I have of Endgame - but it felt....I dunno... a bit muddled and all over the place. Also a big negative for me, was the whole time travel thing... its a bit of a cop out to a certain extent. It (time travel) certainly can be used like in Doctor Strange, but I think such an epic ending to a series of movies, required something a little more special...So I enjoyed it, but feel a bit disappointed. For the parts I enjoyed, they were great. Cap getting the hammer was pretty cool. Thor, the bum, putting in eye drops, was a hoot! Hawkey losing his family in the beginning, was really good. The movie definitely had some cool moments....I am hoping that when I give it a 2nd viewing, my opinion will improve and see it in a better, more plausible context. But for a visit to the movies to watch something special on IMAX, it was a great day out. 7 out of 10.",positive
"I can't for the life of me see why every major epic has to end with beloved characters being killed off. This is not right. This killing off of Black Widow and Iron Man ruined the entire film for me and has me questioning if following the Marvel universe is even worth it anymore. A great film can still be made without the murder of heroes, as was proved recently with Captain Marvel ( a wonderful film), but this new dark ""hard to watch"" direction in movies gets really depressing.",negative
"Here we are at the Endgame and what you get is a treat of all your loved superheroes from MCU giving all they have to take the time back to where we wished for. There are moments where you laugh, cry and feel proud as well but then the establishment of story isn't as appealing as The End to 10 years of a Successful Run should have been. We knew the end, but we would have loved to have a thoughtful Plot as well. Writing is plain goal directed and acting is good. Technically its a strongest game to witness and Emotionally its an Orgasm for a FanBoi. Overall a 3hrs climax to mind who was programmed to amaze with a Winning Run. We love you 3000

""it's just so cheap to mess with time, then why they don't kill thanos so endgame doesn't even has to happen 1/10"". - Did you even watch the movie? (actually a lot of people said that i honestly can't believe it)
""Overrated, only marvel fans will like it 1/10"" - It's the last of 22 movies, if you don't like marvel im guessing you don't like the other 21 movies, so what are you even doing here?

"2019 is a great year for me and a lot of people around my age. I've always regretted that I was born too late to watch the end of The Lord of Rings in a movie theater. And when I could witness the end of HarryPotter in a cinema, I wasn't so into movies back then.However, in 2019 ,I have Avengers:Endgame, GOT and StarWar.So it is a lucky year for my generation. And to begin with, in April , MARVEL brought us Avengers: Endgame.When all those heroes finally came back through that golden circle, I started crying. I believe a lot of MARVEL fans have been hoping for this moment since the end of infinity war. Some commented that the end was too predictable- in the end the bad loses and the heroes win. But I think we've had enough surprises in infinity war and since it's a popcorn movie I think MARVEL has done its best. We've seen spectacular regiment war scences and astonishing deaths. And that's enough. As a true MARVEL fan I'm eternally grateful for all those characters with which I grew up in the last 10+ years.And I'm Also feel pity that I won't be able to see some of them in the near future.I don't how many times I'm gonna watch this film. But I've already talked my dad into contributing to its incredibly high box office",positive
"I still remember when I first saw Iron Man back in elementary school. Later, I was invited by a good friend of mine to see Winter Soldier in theaters. Since then, I've watched almost every single MCU film in theaters, and my favorites (Iron Man, Ultron, Guardians) have been subject to many re-watches. My sister and I often hang out by going to see the latest Marvel flick, and it's become somewhat of a tradition for me. In two months, I'll be going off to college, and an era in my life, one in which Marvel has played an enormous role, will come to an end.Ultimately, that's why this movie matters so much to me. Yes, an era of film is over, but so is one of my eras. It represents that, and the respect it pays to all of the characters I've grown up with is unlike anything. Until I watched this film, I'd never cried during a super hero film. Now I have.If this movie was simply a good conclusion to Infinity War, I would've respected it. But it's so much more than that, and that's why I love it. When I gazed upon the shot of Cap standing by himself against Thanos' army, I thought ""This is Captain America."" When Iron Man was willing to sacrifice everything to do what he knew was right, killing himself in the process, I thought ""This is Iron Man."" If you're a Marvel fan, you'll never see anything quite like this film. Infinity War was a masterpiece. Endgame will be a legend.",positive
"Thoroughly wrapped up with incredible action, excitement, WOW'moments and humor - Avengers: Endgame delivers on it's promise by providing a truly epic conclusion (in the grandest fashion possible!) to 11 years of Marvel Cinematic Universe awesomeness. This one, indeed felt like an emotional roller-coaster ride, and managed to stage a perfect farewell that our beloved superheroes deserved. The Russo brothers have genuinely redefined the art of classic comic book storytelling and set the standards really, really high with their final installment. Despite the longsome 3hr length, the film is sooooo much enjoyable all over that it's quite impossible for anyone to get their eyes off the screen for even a split second. This is probably one of the most emotional films I've ever come across (surprisingly!), with tears in the corner of my eyes during the final moments and witnessing the whole crowd inside the theatre giving a standing ovation as it drew to a close. Endgame faithfully shines in every department, while honoring the past in an incredibly satisfying finale.I feel that both 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame' are must-see events for every movie-goers, whether or not they've seen a Marvel film before. A round of applause for the film makers, cast & crew, all the backroom staff and anyone else who've helped to curate this masterpiece. Screw piracy, Avengers: Endgame is a movie that deserves to be enjoyed in a theatre, and trust me - it's worth every single penny!",positive
"We all were waiting for this but I felt, the ending was beautiful. I really enjoyed the jokes and the fighting scene But either way Mr Stark has suffered a lot i.e form the past and from the future too, he really performed his duty as an Avenger but with this choice, she left her 3000 times aka family. Amazing Movie!!",positive

"I think it was a fitting ending. Some emotional play and pulling at heart strings but I think the Russo brothers got the story-telling wrong here. It does appear as though they ran out of ideas for Endgame since all the great ideas were used up for Infinity War, which I think was a way better film in every sense.I think if most were honest with themselves, they would agree that this wasn't really a good film but gave it a 10 anyway due to the emotional connection and Endgame being, well...the end.",positive

I consider myself as a big fan of Marvel movies but somehow I cannot find this move any great. In ultimate war avengers almost stoped Thanos with his super power of diamond - now there are all of the powers avengers could get and they cannot even barely hurt him. How is this possible? How can Capitan America force Iron Men to give up on his family for the greater good of humanity and at the end just give up in further fight for family reasons? Is it it a bit strange? Generally for end of the saga I was expecting less talking more twists in actions. Whole move could be easily 2 instead of 3 hours. Must see movie but not the greatest one.,positive
"Amazing film, a roller-coaster of emotions too just brilliant.",positive
"Other than wanting to be so politically correct the movie was very good to say the least. If Brie Larson's cold heart melted up in the movie, it would've been even better, but nah, it almost compeltely ruined the whole experience for me.

She's even got the ""I'd like to speak to your manager"" haircut now, so watching her being arrogant af, looking down on evrybody in the movie triggered me even more""",positive

This movie is my favourite movie because I saw this movie with my best friend,positive
"Good, solid, jumbled, chaotic, messy, OTT, PC fun that lacked the stakes, sincerity, intimacy, cohesiveness and the opposing narrative mastery of the utterly brilliant Infinity War.A love letter to fans? Yes, in the comic book sense but films are not comics, the MCU films are inspired by comics. Film craft is drastically different than book or comic. If you're judging Avengers Endgame by the Russo brothers usual excellent MCU standards, who've mostly managed to please comic fans then the Easter egg laden love letter to fans was at the cost of their ability to craft a visual narrative as well as they have in the past.A film is the sum of all its parts like a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. To me, this film was more a trojan horse - it felt it was to service future MCU characters than the current - disguised as a love letter. A film should be made to cater for its own ingredients and not to aid others work, past or future, whilst risking not only deflating your own achievements but literally undoing current cinematic sense, logic, reason and reward in order to draw more cash later over a compelling and ripping yarn now.Suspension of disbelief was mostly removed from this film at the cost of a minefield of forced 'just for laughs' and up-and-coming MCU 'product placement'. The film wasn't allowed to stand alone or, at least stand side-by-side with Infinity War. It felt like the Brothers had orders and those reshoots and last minute edits caused the many, 'what could and should have been' gripes from fans and, potentially the beginning of the End of the MCU.It was a good film, but that's the problem, it should have been far more. There's plenty of good films. What about classic = 5/5 or Great = 4/5. Evidently the Brothers have a knack for turning out classic MCU, what was with the epic-in-scale but overall 3/5 flick?I could write forever but I can't in fear of giving away spoilers. What I will say is, if they can make Thanos, one of the greatest and most misguided cinematic villains of all time become just another baddie seemingly overnight then you can imagine what occurred to some of the other beloved characters in this film. On occasion the OG6 feel entirely forgotten/forgettable and that they're merely in the way of the new, which is odd because it took 10 years to build their arch whilst the likes of Captain Marvels arch is, 'just is'. One film. Boom. We seemingly know all there is to know in less than 2hrs and we're expected to except that because we're told to. The potential future of the MCU could be on a path of, 'just is'. Call me old fashioned but I enjoy character development and risk vs reward vs loss etc. 'Just is', isn't compelling enough for me. Very soon, 'just is' won't be enough full stop.In short there's a lot to like in Endgame just as there was in The Return of the Jedi. That about sums up Avengers 4 really. There are people out there who love Jedi and there are others who thought Empire Strikes Back should have had a much, much stronger follow up. And, what happened to the quality of the Star Wars Universe beyond Jedi?I've a terrible feeling Phase 4 killed the MCU before Phase 4 even got off the ground...",positive
This is all you want after 11 years everything in this movie is almost perfect( except time traveling) bt finally tanks Russo Brothers and farewell,positive
"I know why some people are giving it 5/6/7/8 and no movie is perfect and it has some shortcoming but nonetheless it delivers what the finale of a saga is supposed to be. It is incomparabale to any other superhero movie. It has drama, comedy, high emotions and ultimate mind bending action scenes with a lot of twists and surprises to make this movie near perfect for me.
It doesn't deserve a rating below 10 and hats off to Russo brothers they are awesome.",positive
"Best MCU movie. Pew Pew!I thought the Russo Brothers wrapped up everything very nicely blah blah blah... what else do I have to say... you've already seen this movie. It's the highest grossing film ever made, everyone and their grandmother's have seen this movie. Go see independent films, i guess. Woopity doo!",positive
The massive line up of films is concluded in the most perfect way. This has not only ended certain aspects amazing but also sets up future pathways just right. I have never cried in the cinema but this film changed that. Just speechless. So many amazing parts to this film. A must watch!!!,positive
"Contrary to most, I left the movie theater with not much left of End Game inside me...Despite giving a satisfying ending to a decade of greatness experienced in Marvel cinematic universe, and the battle scene is perhaps one of the best in recent years, the emotional journey of some key characters are sadly, not that emotional. They felt flat, which are pitiful as those characters deserve more recognitions and a better tribute. There exists some obvious plot holes as well, which did affect my experience watching the movie.Can't deny that this is a very entertaining movie, however, like most Marvel movies, personally, I don't see this age well...",positive
"It is the best movie in Marvel history i think. First of all, all character's acting was good. I waited endgame so long after the Avengers infinity war. People have high expectation. In infinity war most of heroes and people died. And i tried to predict how died heroes coma back, how they win Thanos, how ending can be. finally i just want to you advice one thing, go to the theater and watch it. You won't regret.",positive
"Well it is quite obvious that avengers lovers are going to be sad about the ending..I appreciated the movie but I think that there could have been a better ending. Characters like Thor and captain Marvel have had less importance in the ending. It would have been better if Thor would have possessed an ultimate power,with his 2 hammers. which could kill Thanos
Or, Captain Marvel and Thor could have battled Thanos. Iron man and the other avengers could have then joined hands to exterminate Thanos and destroy the infinity stones once and for all",positive
"This movie was a complete mess, after all the years of build up, I didn't care.
It was like putting an entire smörgåsbord into a very small bowl. All the flavours and textures blended and lost their appeal.
Only two characters stood out, Thor and Antman.",negative
Endgame gave several realistic endings to this amazing and ultra fantasizing world. The story lines were so in depth and crazy twisted and concluded in an unimaginable way.,positive
"Let me preface this review by saying: I Freacking Loved this move on first viewing in 3D IMAX opening night. Second viewing I had questions!Pros:
1.The build up of 10years of some great story lines and Characters pulled right from the pages leading up to a great 3hour edge of your seat block buster.
2. Visually beautiful Cgi, with today's technology these movies can take us on crazy out if this world experience (pun intended)
3. Star studded line up of marvel/Hollywoods who's who.
4. The feels, there are some moments in the movie that had me welling up, not just because they were sad moment but because I am a 30+ year fan of the stories and Characters and seeing them come to life just made me happier and a child at Christmas.
5. The Easter eggs, you can watch 10 times and still stop somthing new. There are some in your face references and some subtle ones.Cons:
1. Pacing, because it was a 3hour film the pacing does drag a bit. There was clearly a longer cut of the movie and it shows and the story is like a jigsaw that has some missing pieces. You can still tell what it is but just donesnt look as good.
2. The All female moment! This just stopped the momentum of the movie cold. The whole cinema let out a ""oh no"" shigh collectively.
3. The time paradox explanation just doesn't hold up. And the story breaks it's own rules multiple times. I feel like there was more to it but it just didnt mate the final draft.Overview:
All in all this movie stands up and is a great popcorn flick. 8stars",positive
"I watched this movie on the pre-release fan day on Thursday April 25th. After a year of fan theories and guessing game. This movie was totally different from what I was expecting to see. It was a complete emotional rollercoaster. With really high peaks and an ending I didn't see coming. This is a must see movie.
I do have to admit that it was not as good as Infinity War. I feel that the comedy was a bit too much and some of the fight was not how I think it should have been. But I left with a smile and going to watch it again. It was just too much to take in in one seating. My emotions couldn't handle this amount of info.LOVED IT!!",positive
"This movie is unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's a time travel movie with the epicness of a Lord of the Rings Film. It has many emotional character moments and visually stunning set pieces. This is the Marvel movie that we have been waiting for for 11 years and I would say it was well worth the wait. Expect to cry, laugh, and cheer a lot. If you're a Marvel fan, I bet you won't be disappointed in the slightest",positive
"I think the storyline is great, really enjoyed it and it's really quite unpredictable. The scenes were really heart-warming but I had one serious issue with the character development and power scaling. That didn't allow me to enjoy the movie fully and when it ended I didn't get the very satisfied feeling which I had from Infinity wars.",positive
"If you are a comic fan this is probably the most important movie you should watch. It was a perfect tribute to the past 21 MCU movies , combining things from almost all of them. It made me cry, made me laugh and most importantly it made me feel like a kid when I watched the first iron man movie in theater. The only thing that I didn't like was the soundtrack work which copied themes from infinity war and it's impact wasn't so powerful but the movie is still 10/10 for me",positive
"MARVEL movies are action flicks predominantly, this one took the gamble of character development and bringing in raw emotions in much of the movie, while the fight scene towards the end was choreographed brilliantly, somehow the movie didn't work on the drama level, and time travel concepts are always a risky bet, and somehow in the end, it did not come of as well, at the end of the day. Avengers End Game is a fitting tribute to all the major characters, but it certainly did not live up the expectation that was delivered in its previous installment.",positive
"The movie is perfect, it gave the fans what they wanted.i",positive
"I enjoyed the movie, but it was disappointing. I expected more. The movie was very predictable. But the ""Avengers: Infinity War"" was better though.",positive
"If one Avengers production budget funded indie movies, we'd have hundreds of thousands of engaging, good indie films. Please stop making these films now. Just stop. We have the video game somewhere I'm sure, no need to keep on calling them movies. The problem with mass cinema goers is that they actually think this type of film is good. All candy and no cake. I can't watch another one.",negative
